Noise can be a issue with the Highway 17 traffic. We usually come here to use the launch as Thunder Lake is a wonderful Lake Trout fishery. Good Walleye fishing can be had also. Good clean park.  Friendly staff.   A bit too close to the highway for me.  Too much traffic noise for my liking but still, a great park to stay at. Nice sites and facilities .way too close to the highway tho . The truck traffic is constant and the noise from it is overbearing.  If you're looking for a peaceful , quiet time this is not the place .Especially at night. This place is amazing. One of the best camp sites ive been too. I’ve always wanted to stay at this park and I finally made it a reality! Loved every moment of it! Great place very clean codes to Nate and Shelley go job Clean, well maintained park. Employees cheerful and helpful. Love the place nice spots and great staff. Cute little park. We heard 20 species of birds just by driving around. Great spot off the highway for a relaxing place to camp for a night or two. Nice clean campground and friendly staff Great little park. Was a great place to pull in for the night. Private camp sites. Clean bathrooms and awesome showers. A beautiful lake, this is a very relaxing place. I will be back again. Hopefully we can stay a little longer Beautiful place to camp this summer This is a very convenient park to visit while traveling across Canada. The park did not have potable water available when we stayed there. The showers were among the best we have experienced while traveling across Canada. The day before ... Stopped here really briefly. Nice looking lake. Three stars because we had to pay for a park pass to use the bathroom and it wasn't the most pleasant facility. No sink or soap and the door didn't lock on the men's room. 

Might be a nice place to camp by the lake? Not sure didn't stay long enough  to really check it out.  Pretty park right off the highway, so you do hear the traffic a bit. Beautiful scenery and loved the main beach, but the second one was barely existing due to water levels. We didn't like our booked site 76, but moved to 72 which we loved. Clean showers (and adjustable warmth) and nice staff! Good. But not my favorite Beautiful spot! A beautiful place for a rest on a ling road trip. A lot of nice campsites here.  Cute beach and some of the bathrooms were way nicer than they had to be. Park was full but still fairly quiet, kids enjoyed, and still close enough to town if you forget/run out of something the store is only 10/15 min away Beautiful and serene had a  great time there  the   staff are great people so kind great place to go and have fun and rest Can't wait for our next visit. Stayed a night in this park instead of going to a hotel, was very pleased with the experience. It was quiet and clean, with electricity options. Great service and it was cheap too! Bathrooms are clean and the bugs aren't too bad. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for rest and relaxation :) Great campsites, wood that actually burns and very clean. Only issue is that there is no drinking water. All has to be boiled first.  Nice lake, awesome views, and clean showers and washrooms not far from most campsites. Bugs can get a little overwhelming at times though. Bring bug spray! Nice park but there are no campsites that have easy access to the lake if you want to go swimming or kayaking. For those activities you need to go to the beach or the boat launch.  Nice park! Nice park to camp! Great camping Great campground two beaches site 39 has water dam and streams. It's beautiful!

We were unable to cook any food or have a campfire at night. So we just set up our tent and starved.

 Otherwise ... This campgroumd is very nice. Store close buy, sells coffee and breakfast. Has some awesome lots. Bathrooms always seem to be clean. Showers are used alot so floor is always wet. Makes getting dressed tricky. Awesome variety of activities to do such as paddling, biking(family & MTB), hiking. Very nice lake. 
Not enough washrooms in campground, but showers are good. Poor privacy on most sites.
Store, restaurant and bike rental shop are convenient. Nice campground, but very crowded. We stayed at site 18, which was closer to the beach and quite large! Camp staff were nice, and warned us of a bear in the area. washroom was well cleaned. The beach was closed due to algae, so we didn't get to swim, or dog did enjoy the dog beach. Nice camping with an appreciable beach but toilets are never cleaned. Also not operating!! As it is already small capacity if you had toilets blocked it becomes complicated. Also no trash available in the park except at the entrance ... Wonderful beach with both electric and non electric camp sights. The beach is smooth sandy and clean. Canoe’ can be rented through portage canoeing company for on site delivery Easy campground for tent trailer setup and close access to all the trails. Always a bear problem at these sites so pack carefully and keep food locked in your car. Pretty nice beach here and bike trails along old railway bed. Beautiful clean park with nice beach. My two sons learned how to kayak and loved the experience. Would love to back soon. Amazing place. Nature, great landscapes and clear sky at night. This is a place to relax, have some fun and enjoy Canadian nature. You will find lots of activities to do depending the plan and everything at the park seems to be taken care of. Great spot. Large camp sites and the park is amazing specially during fall time. It was really nice and peaceful during the week, however Friday night became loud. Even though Park staff drive through nothing is enforced.  Another dumping stationed is needed in this park. 
Such a beautiful park with so much to do. Caters to the needs of different campers. Nice sites. Great place to bike and swim. Perfect for the whole family. Great campground with acces to a beach. Even a small dog beach. It's a big campground.  Some lots are big others are average.  Beach is nice.  Area us great. Biggest Dear Flies I've ever seen, pretty sure they had teeth. Really didn't like the fact that water fill and tank emptying was off site. Otherwise a clean campground with helpful friendly staff. Great place. Lots to explore in the area. Just be mindful of the bears. 
Its there place and we are the visitors. Be prepared to shell out the big bucks for permits in this place.  Wardens adorned in ""bulletproof "" vests play tough especially with unsuspecting visitors. Mew Lake Yurt # 39 is fabulous Sites quite open. Camp alot in Algonquin and only here once. Kids didn't like it which was enough for me. Lake of Two Rivers Store, great icecream & restaurant too.  Lots of choice and most necessary items in the store. I love it here....but been waiting since end of May for a refund....office is very hard to get a hold of. The land was not a good place in the rain for me. Mobile signal is good. 118 is just behind the store. Beautiful  place to visit....  Tracking  is awesome as well take water and some food for tracking 🤗 This is an amazing campground in the heart of the Algonquin Park! Staff is great, campsites are big and washrooms are clean.    The store's got everything you might need in case you've forgotten something at home. Beautiful hiking trails! The lake is great for canoeing! Very nice campground lost of nice sites. Although I will say not alot of privacy in any of them almost like Walmart parking with trees and a fire pit. 
It is all right but if you are looking for a place to get away it's not here. Can definitely go again n again . It was a perfect beach campground , didnt expect it to be great but love it. One word: awesome. Going again as soon as I can. You see BEARS! Nice campground. Not too much privacy. Go slow if you have a larger travel trailer of 5th wheel. It is very tight in some areas! Great beach. Great swimming. Families having fun Love Algonquin Park. Perfect for the beginner or avid camper. Activities for all ages and skill levels. Sites have limited privacy, but the lake is beautiful and plenty to do nearby. Bear encounter on site: Lake of Two Rivers has been the go-to campground for my family. Its mid-point location in the park, direct access to Hwy 60, close proximity to the store, beautiful lake for swimming/canoeing and tall tree canopy ... Very busy campground with low privacy and few busses of schools kids while we were there .. so not very relaxing.  The campsite are more expensive than others campgrounds in the area and the less quality.  Also while we were there, there ... Very nice place had lot of fun with kids and specially with living with black bear yes thats true I'm back for the 3rd time in a year we love it Such a beautiful place and leaving with black Bear yes heared it right Two Rivers Park is in a good location as far as access to many hiking trails, and surrounding lakes within Algonquin, and you are in a good location to do a lot of exploring. So if you are just looking for a park to setup and then day ... Always enjoy this park Vwey nice clean park but very noise recomend site away from hiway as far as posible there is a store and cafa but everything is triple the price Its a good campground for family's. Nice beach, showers, bathrooms but if you looking to party and stray up late not the place to be. Water was cold but beautiful place Awesome place in summer.
We also visited in winters but it was all frozen another new experience to have. The campground is one of my favourites of the provincial parks and they've done a lot of work clearing trees this year.  2nd year in a row where the sanitary station ran out of potable water early on Friday evening of the long weekend ... Love camping here early in the season. Alot of bugs but not many people! Great campground.  Busy and some of the sites are a little less private than would be nice. Occasionally has a algea bloom in the lake which affects the shower and swimming.  Water is trucked in but short in supply. Decent campground, facilities and beach staff are nice too Been there many time. It one of our best camping site. Try to book a site further in, if not you can hear the cars from the highway Loved our time here. Absolutely love this campground. All of the staff are very friendly here and the facilities are well kept. The lake here is awesome for a relaxing swim or for some games, and the beach has a great volleyball net. I try to come back here every year and the staff are the main ones that make that happen. Algonquin park 
I miss this quite and relaxing place Beautiful but too busy on weekends Campground with very low privacy,not a lot of trees or bushes between camp sites. Beautiful pine trees everywhere however, there's a lot of sap dripping on your tent and picnic table. Two nice beaches, good views on the lake, possibility to rent a canoe. Good selection, on the pricy side though. Lake of two rivers is a little louder than some of the other campgrounds in Algonquin and is very open (less privacy).  It is still very central and has a great beach and canoe launch with excellent swimming areas.  There is a good size separate dog beach on the far side of the boats area.  Helpful staff! Thanks for all the info! Very good, like the view and quiet campground A good place for camping Not friendly staff. Specially if you not white. Loved their ice cream 😍😍 Closed in the winter unfortunately A great place to check out the fall colours via a canoe, but not the most private of campgrounds... I'd say, it is a great place for your first time camping, but if you are looking for a more secluded and private experience, try one of the other campgrounds. A bonus is that you can canoe over to Pog Lake etc., no problem! Great campground! Haven't actually spent one night yet...but...I know from what I've heard that it is gonna be super-incredible! Got enough rest and relaxed.
Very fresh air and clean water.  The campsite was clean & washroom Went with my friends to this place in 2016. Loved the area. Very well maintained. Would love to go again sometime.  Great place Nice lookout.helpful staff..get quick bite,restrooms..... Really nice Awesome. great place to go camping I lives lake of two rivers so quiet and beach was awsome and I just had the best time ever with my family! Again the only bummer is that it's right by the high way 60 but other than that it was the best weekend ever!!! The best place for camping Great through the week but the party animals come out on the weekends.  Park staff don't seem to control them much and takes way from the camping experience.  I like to party as well but who comes to Algonquin to get plowed? Algonquin is to reconnect with nature.  Amazing, great views, fun, every time I go it's a great time One of the busiest campgrounds but nice and located centrally for making day trips to the trails and attractions in the park. Nice, beautiful and clean campground for an  awesome camping experience Fun Awesome just awesome 
Clean beach great water love the island. Had a blast there Awesome campground, especially along river Nice and close to the lake & beach but no flat areas to place a tent which meant sleeping on a slope.  Not much privacy and notable noise from Hwy60. The Campground itself is nice and the location is great. However, the Park Wardens are the problem. I don't recommend this site to anyone other than families. My group was treated extremely unfairly and ruined the entire experience. Look elsewhere. Overcrowded, but if your looking for convenience and access to hwy 60 trails ,it doesn't get any more convenient than this campground  Amazing. Highly recommend the beach & two rivers trail. Great location and I loved the tall pines. Not too much privacy, but the sites are quite large. However there is one serious problem...One washroom & shower facility per 100 sites! That means up to 500+ people for three showers(total), ... Beautiful campsites, it's Algonquin at its best. Awesome I agree with Vale Ntin ... great location but not enough washrooms and toiletts. When we are here only 30% of the campgrounds are used ... and that´s ok - but not more!

Sehr schoen gelegen, grosszuegige Stellplaetze im Wald ... aber nicht zu dunkel. Unser bester Campground in ON! Poor privacy!!! Great place with great staff Need to quiet down Clean showers and friendly park rangers Nice cambground nice and quiet Lake of Two Rivers. Amazing  (Translated by Google) Very nice place, in the middle of the Algonquin provincial park. Huge pitches, plumbing already old, showers not heated. Only electricity at the place everything else externally. Very nice for the area.

Even though Park staff drive through nothing is enforced.  Another dumping stationed is needed in this park. 
Such a beautiful park with so much to do. Caters to the needs of different campers. Nice sites. Great place to bike and swim. Perfect for the whole family. Great campground with acces to a beach. Even a small dog beach. It's a big campground.  Some lots are big others are average.  Beach is nice.  Area us great. Biggest Dear Flies I've ever seen, pretty sure they had teeth. Really didn't like the fact that water fill and tank emptying was off site. Otherwise a clean campground with helpful friendly staff. Great place. Lots to explore in the area. Just be mindful of the bears. 
Its there place and we are the visitors. Be prepared to shell out the big bucks for permits in this place.  Wardens adorned in ""bulletproof "" vests play tough especially with unsuspecting visitors. Mew Lake Yurt # 39 is fabulous Sites quite open. Camp alot in Algonquin and only here once. Kids didn't like it which was enough for me. Lake of Two Rivers Store, great icecream & restaurant too.  Lots of choice and most necessary items in the store. I love it here....but been waiting since end of May for a refund....office is very hard to get a hold of. The land was not a good place in the rain for me. Mobile signal is good. 118 is just behind the store. Beautiful  place to visit....  Tracking  is awesome as well take water and some food for tracking 🤗 This is an amazing campground in the heart of the Algonquin Park! Staff is great, campsites are big and washrooms are clean.    The store's got everything you might need in case you've forgotten something at home. Beautiful hiking trails! The lake is great for canoeing! Very nice campground lost of nice sites. Although I will say not alot of privacy in any of them almost like Walmart parking with trees and a fire pit. 
It is all right but if you are looking for a place to get away it's not here. Can definitely go again n again . It was a perfect beach campground , didnt expect it to be great but love it. One word: awesome. Going again as soon as I can. You see BEARS! Nice campground. Not too much privacy. Go slow if you have a larger travel trailer of 5th wheel. It is very tight in some areas! Great beach. Great swimming. Families having fun Love Algonquin Park. Perfect for the beginner or avid camper. Activities for all ages and skill levels. Sites have limited privacy, but the lake is beautiful and plenty to do nearby. Bear encounter on site: Lake of Two Rivers has been the go-to campground for my family. Its mid-point location in the park, direct access to Hwy 60, close proximity to the store, beautiful lake for swimming/canoeing and tall tree canopy ... Very busy campground with low privacy and few busses of schools kids while we were there .. so not very relaxing.  The campsite are more expensive than others campgrounds in the area and the less quality.  Also while we were there, there ... Very nice place had lot of fun with kids and specially with living with black bear yes thats true I'm back for the 3rd time in a year we love it Such a beautiful place and leaving with black Bear yes heared it right Two Rivers Park is in a good location as far as access to many hiking trails, and surrounding lakes within Algonquin, and you are in a good location to do a lot of exploring. So if you are just looking for a park to setup and then day ... Always enjoy this park Vwey nice clean park but very noise recomend site away from hiway as far as posible there is a store and cafa but everything is triple the price Its a good campground for family's. Nice beach, showers, bathrooms but if you looking to party and stray up late not the place to be. Water was cold but beautiful place Awesome place in summer.
We also visited in winters but it was all frozen another new experience to have. The campground is one of my favourites of the provincial parks and they've done a lot of work clearing trees this year.  2nd year in a row where the sanitary station ran out of potable water early on Friday evening of the long weekend ... Love camping here early in the season. Alot of bugs but not many people! Great campground.  Busy and some of the sites are a little less private than would be nice. Occasionally has a algea bloom in the lake which affects the shower and swimming.  Water is trucked in but short in supply. Decent campground, facilities and beach staff are nice too Been there many time. It one of our best camping site. Try to book a site further in, if not you can hear the cars from the highway Loved our time here. Absolutely love this campground. All of the staff are very friendly here and the facilities are well kept. The lake here is awesome for a relaxing swim or for some games, and the beach has a great volleyball net. I try to come back here every year and the staff are the main ones that make that happen. Algonquin park 
I miss this quite and relaxing place Beautiful but too busy on weekends Campground with very low privacy,not a lot of trees or bushes between camp sites. Beautiful pine trees everywhere however, there's a lot of sap dripping on your tent and picnic table. Two nice beaches, good views on the lake, possibility to rent a canoe. Good selection, on the pricy side though. Lake of two rivers is a little louder than some of the other campgrounds in Algonquin and is very open (less privacy).  It is still very central and has a great beach and canoe launch with excellent swimming areas.  There is a good size separate dog beach on the far side of the boats area.  Helpful staff! Thanks for all the info! Very good, like the view and quiet campground A good place for camping Not friendly staff. Specially if you not white. Loved their ice cream 😍😍 Closed in the winter unfortunately A great place to check out the fall colours via a canoe, but not the most private of campgrounds... I'd say, it is a great place for your first time camping, but if you are looking for a more secluded and private experience, try one of the other campgrounds. A bonus is that you can canoe over to Pog Lake etc., no problem! Great campground! Haven't actually spent one night yet...but...I know from what I've heard that it is gonna be super-incredible! Got enough rest and relaxed.
Very fresh air and clean water.  The campsite was clean & washroom Went with my friends to this place in 2016. Loved the area. Very well maintained. Would love to go again sometime.  Great place Nice lookout.helpful staff..get quick bite,restrooms..... Really nice Awesome. great place to go camping I lives lake of two rivers so quiet and beach was awsome and I just had the best time ever with my family! Again the only bummer is that it's right by the high way 60 but other than that it was the best weekend ever!!! The best place for camping Great through the week but the party animals come out on the weekends.  Park staff don't seem to control them much and takes way from the camping experience.  I like to party as well but who comes to Algonquin to get plowed? Algonquin is to reconnect with nature.  Amazing, great views, fun, every time I go it's a great time One of the busiest campgrounds but nice and located centrally for making day trips to the trails and attractions in the park. Nice, beautiful and clean campground for an  awesome camping experience Fun Awesome just awesome 
Clean beach great water love the island. Had a blast there Awesome campground, especially along river Nice and close to the lake & beach but no flat areas to place a tent which meant sleeping on a slope.  Not much privacy and notable noise from Hwy60. The Campground itself is nice and the location is great. However, the Park Wardens are the problem. I don't recommend this site to anyone other than families. My group was treated extremely unfairly and ruined the entire experience. Look elsewhere. Overcrowded, but if your looking for convenience and access to hwy 60 trails ,it doesn't get any more convenient than this campground  Amazing. Highly recommend the beach & two rivers trail. Great location and I loved the tall pines. Not too much privacy, but the sites are quite large. However there is one serious problem...One washroom & shower facility per 100 sites! That means up to 500+ people for three showers(total), ... Beautiful campsites, it's Algonquin at its best. Awesome I agree with Vale Ntin ... great location but not enough washrooms and toiletts. When we are here only 30% of the campgrounds are used ... and that´s ok - but not more!

Sehr schoen gelegen, grosszuegige Stellplaetze im Wald ... aber nicht zu dunkel. Unser bester Campground in ON! Poor privacy!!! Great place with great staff Need to quiet down Clean showers and friendly park rangers Nice cambground nice and quiet Lake of Two Rivers. Amazing  (Translated by Google) Very nice place, in the middle of the Algonquin provincial park. Huge pitches, plumbing already old, showers not heated. Only electricity at the place everything else externally. Very nice for the area.

There is a fair amount of … Went Dec 18-21 and the park was beautiful. Went with a bunch of friends to hike and photo shoot and we were more than impressed with the trails. There was a good number of them too. A few paths were closed but we still had a great time.
Bonus: wildlife are not afraid to interact with you. We love Mew Lake in the winter.  Thank you to Harvey Cornell for always going that extra mile to make the park such a wonderful place to be.  And thanks for always making that rink so amazing for the Hockey players and skaters. Great in all seasons, winter time is a must to experience the ice rink alongside the fire pit. Bring hot dogs and marshmallows for roasting along with skates. Awesome place! The campground is well maintained and clean. Flush toilets and showers make it an easy sell for those not really into the back country style camping. 
The beach was a nice soft sand bottom with nice clear water. For the … Mew Lake Campground was reasonably priced and had beautiful pine trees, lakes and scenery.  The amenities were good for being in the wilderness.  Our cell phones and data worked, had satellite TV to get FOX news and had electric. … Mew Lake campground is located in the middle of Highway Corridor 60 in Algonquin Park, just before the Lake of Two Rivers Store. The campground is relatively small and beautiful. Some of the campsites have a very beautiful waterfront … There has a lovely skating link. A delightful and well-managed clean campground is made us feel happy Great Facility! This would be a great way to introduce someone to Algonquin camping! You can rough it if you like but there are amenities (showers, toilets and fresh water) to make it easy. We have been trying out different camp ground in Algonquin Provincial Park this past 5 years and we liked Mew Lake Campground the best so far. It located about the middle of highway 60 corridor so is easy to access to both east and west … Just peaceful beautiful place always happy to go back there Wonderful place to camp in the winter time. (Havent camped here in the summer yet) 
The public hot tent, fire pit and ice rink is amazing and so much fun! 
And they had hot water for showers still! 
Overall such a great experience … Good average campground in the park. One of the best campgrounds if you are pulling a large trailer and need a larger site. Great camp ground. Got a site by the lake with plenty of room enough for 2-3 families. Beautiful during the Fall season. Thank-you. Nice staff. Nice campground. This is only the second campground I have stayed at in Algonquin Park. There is a good sized beach on the small lake. It is pretty close to the highway, so I found it a little noisy with road traffic. Will try a different campground for my next visit. Absolute heaven! Only been here 2 days so far but loving every moment. Site and showers are clean. Walked a couple of close trails and the views are awesome. I love yurt camping and this time we saw moose, wild turkey and fox.  Going back again in February and March. Great campsite with a beautiful view of the lake! Campsite #93. Make sure to bring bug spray and a good camera! Launch your canoe right off the site. One more word of advice get gas and any tobacco products before you hit Algonquin park or you'll have to drive back!! Great campground, nice sandy beach, and the added bonus of a shower station and washrooms! Only suggestion I have, please stop letting people pick all the berries in the field and leaving none for the bears. Bears are now stealing food … It's absolutely bizarre why this campground is situated right next to the highway where the motorcycles and trucks are loud all day and all night.  I don't understand why this campground hasn't been relocated farther away from the highway ages ago...  I guess there's only 7,653 km² of park. Great place to bring the family, friends or even just yourself. The campground is connected to both hiking and biking trails that lead to beautiful scenery. The facilities are in good shape and all the camping lots are well maintained. If you’re looking for a weekend in a developed campground, choose Mew Lake. Nice campground very taken care of. However if you plan to be up longer than 10pm beware you will get complaints and visits from camp wardens lmfao. All in all a nice spot. Have been camping here since I was a kid. we bring our children here every year now and always look forward to it. It has a great atmosphere, the staff are great and so are the campers. Great campground when run by Ontario Parks. Did not enjoy this campground at all. Even though it's in a very large provincial park many of the campsites are so close to the road that you can hear traffic from your tent, I wasn't really impressed by the lake itself either and the ""quiet zone"" we stayed in still had people playing radio, bringing dogs etc. Nice campground.  Hydro sites are large.  Comfort station is old and needs to be replaced. Somewhat noisey close to Hwy 60. If you are COLORED person, make sure you stay AWAY from PARK RANGERS. They will HARASS you at every turn. It was horrible experience interacting with park employees. They are RACIST. 

I felt that employees think that CANADA and parks … Feel little crowded but beautiful place. Mew Lake is the classic mixed used front country campground.

-It's open year round.
-The spots are almost all big enough to park a pop up camper in (if not much bigger).
-The privacy is fair with a slight amount of tree cover between … This is worst camp ground I have seen in Ontario. Dirty and smelly washrooms. When I gave feedback to the camp office, they told me that it's luxury camping. If you don't like it, you can leave it any time.

Camp sites and Walkways camp sites are littered with garbage. 3 girlfriends and I wanted to winter camp in a yurt and dogsled. It was all better than we expected. The ""hosts"" on site were great to deal with. Beautiful area to visit. Recommend dog sledding at Northridge Ranch in Huntsville. Dogs are very well treated. Beautiful campground with lovely trails. Nicer, much more private sites than LO2R. Still close to store, restaurant and bike rental shop. Lake is very small though. Fantastic spot winter or summer Excellent campground with a private beach good placement in the park as well! Great that it's Algonquin. Lots of wild life. Small campground with not much privacy Been coming here now 4 years every Canada day week till the next weekend love it nice park no robo cop kids in there bulletproof vest coming up to your fire when your just sitting talking telling you to keep it down definitely a vary decent park nice beach lots to do around and in the park Really nice to have a separate no radio/dog free area. Lake is beautiful but i dont recommend swimming in it. Fyi theres only 1 public washroom in the whole campground, but there are outposts. Lots of different kinds of birds and chipmunks around. We enjoyed our stay! Great place to get away from it all showers and laundry facilities on site friendly staff open in winter too for the adventurous type The water was amazing and I saw that there were camp signs right by the water saw plenty of people canoeing swimming and fishing Dirty washrooms where taps not functioning and toilets are clogged even after telling park people few times. Bathrooms are never cleaned and too much gunk inside. 

I saw people drinking in bathroom area two nights in a row. I told the … I'm not a fan of car camping but this is a.good campground.  I use it as a jump off.to the interior if I arrive too late to hit the trails Great area. A lot of trails close to Campground. Clean and altogether enjoyable. This is my favourite place, get your own. Our family loves this campground! The bathrooms are clean, showers have nice, hot water and the hospitality station is great too! It's fairly central to most hiking trails which is a bonus. Great camp site. Quite and peaceful. Right by water. Great park. Great trails for byke and walking Relaxing great trails, wild life galore saw moose and calf.  Yurt Camping is easy in the snow and melting snow Amazing!! Little too close to highwa Damn good site... but the shower room water is way too hot... Loved the campground. Roomy sites, clean comfort station and courteous staff! Nice campsites with good lake access and decent privacy. Only drawback is that the highway is right across the lake and is fairly loud. People were great,lake close by. The annual place to camp during the  winter season. Was told by the park help I had to wait until 8am to check out before I could leave as I arrived late. I had planned to be on the road by 6:30. Waited until 8:30 by the time they got the computers going for them to ask me my site # and say thanks have a nice day. Will not use again if I cannot arrive before 7pm love the gonk! Excellent place for all ages We make a yearly visit to this campground. We also enjoy renting the Yurts in the winter for a family camp out. Beautiful campground. The radio free zone is always my favourite area to camp. The little lake is so nice to way up to. This is a beautiful campground. We saw a family of ducks. My cousin saw a moose and another camper saw a beaver. We stayed at 114 in the radio and dog free zone. The frog symphony played us to sleep. The beach is lovely. Wish it had brought my paddle board. Love this park. Park staff and host, Tom we so helpful. Great for car camping, great sites and some sites are off of mew lake. 

Washrooms are a little outdated. great site overall Very well looked after. A bit close to the highway though. The perfect place to go winter camping, especially if you have kids. Heated washrooms, running water, a community ice rink and warming tent are all available at Mew Lake. A great place for a winter getaway.  This campground has a warm comfort station,  gorgeous views, and a skating rink for lots of winter fun. We had a quiet spot without many campers around, but we could hear people across the lake. Come prepared with fire starters though because the wood from the park store is damp.  Great clean park Always loved this place! Great place. Beautiful layout, easy to register and get into. No issues whatsoever. Our favorite Algonquin camping site!. The dog and radio free area offers very secluded sites. Much quieter than the other nearby campgrounds. It is about 10 minutes by bike along a beautiful wooded trail to get to the main camp store. Mew lake has a nice beach area and access to the railway walking/cycling trail. Enjoyed the dog and radio free area with it's secluded sites. While the park has sites with electricity they are not within this area and are not nearly as secluded. If you can live without electricity and do not have pets this is great place to visit. Really nice camp sites on he water, but mine was too close to the highway so the road noise was a bit loud. Algonquin is a beautiful gem. Mew Lake is an excellent spot for car camping and has beautiful views. Only downfall is it is too close to highway 60'and there is road noise. Mew Lake Campground is a pretty nice spot.  
Choose your site wisely because there are wide variety.
My spot on this stay was across the lake from the Highway so there was a lot of traffic noise into the early evening.
Otherwise, the … Nice site (107) with a view of the water, but too close to the highway for our preferences. ... This campground is absolutely magical in Winter though (stayed in one of the yurts in February) Huge sites and the campground was beautiful Nice campgrounds. Water is cold in the lake. Too much mosquitoes Great camping. Large lots. Good showers. We went family day weekend, I was surprised with just  how many people camp in the winter.  And they were having  a whole winter festival in too. Enjoyed a winter weekend in one of the yurts. Loved it - great for cross-country skiing, outdoor cooking over a fire and there was even a skating rink. Heater in the yurt was great, but it struggled to fight the cold outside (below -25 Celcius overnight) so be prepared with lots of warm gear! good place Large sites, quiet in winter, heated comfort stations. Open all year round Quite, beautiful, lots of empty camping areas Nice for camping. We recommend a yurt. Beautiful!! The campsites are huge! A quiet campground..can't wait to come back! 😁 Great time winter camping. Relaxing and quiet. Washrooms in bad state! Clean nice park Love the sites Great time. 🔥🏕️ Mew Lake Campground keeps one electric sector open all year around. It is relatively small and cozy. Most of the sites have good size.  Summer or winter it's a great campground. Beautiful lake.. A bit close to highway Great for winter hikes. The only campground open year round as their comfort stations are winterized. Not as quiet as I had expected. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. Honor system for firewood is very good.  Great place to camp if you like wildlife.  There's usually a warning about black bears in the area.  Some of the people who camp here leave a lot of garbage and have little respect for other campers though. really wonderful and quiet place. Especially nice to see in the fall when the colours change. TONS of great trails nearby too Was covered in ice and no salt options available in the camp ground Great experience here. Clean fresh air, with water on all  3 sides. The ground is very soft for the tent peg to go in. I survived - 47C with wind chill in a hot tent, and got to see a woodpecker to boot! Fantastic visitor center. The viewpoints are amazing fore wildlife. Especially in winter, Great camping site, small, but private. The only issue is that being close to the highway, you can hear the occasional truck at night, other than that, this has been my favourite camp site so far. Beautiful spring ;) It was a decent campground. Not very large in size. We camped in the radio free, dog free zone. The site we had was nice, had a slight view of the lake. You could hear the highway traffic from our sight. Not super noticable though, but … Beautiful campground Excellent camp.
Lots of animals, a lake and in a fantastic location.
Hot showers and proper bathrooms etc. A beautiful and affordable campsite on the lakeshore, close to several hiking trails and a short drive from the Algonquin Visitor's Centre. Beach nearby Great place. Well looked after. Great people. I've been to Mew Lake a few times, and each time it's a great experience. Try to get site 96 or 97, they're great! Beautiful area and a great campground. Campsites around 119 can see and hear wild cars roaming around highway 60. Quite and peaceful but a lot of Mosquitoes ! I love this place. We go throughout the summer and bathe in the fields of blueberries as we watch bears wander past in the distance and then in October we bring the kids there to camp and trick or treat. Amazing time in the fall. So many colours. Truly breathtaking  The usual experience Great access to trails,and bike trail.  Few nice sites with some privacy Came here for a party, left satisfied and happy. The park is beautiful along with lake.  Non reservable placdes arent always marked as such. Amazing time with the family Good to sit on the Beach for long time in a deep fall. Decent sites but close to highway and as a result is very noisy from the traffic. Central location on HWY 60 is convenient for accessing the hikes and Visitor Centre Very clean and natural. All Algonquin parks are great. Great hiking, biking options Will come agaim for.sure! Walked about 6 kms on a trail from the campground. Lots of snow!  Nice shower with heated floor. nice campground in general, but the quiet zone is the zone closest to the highway. Beautiful We had something stolen from our tent overnight.  Beautiful sites, but has some minimal highway noise. Good view and nice hosts... Our favorite Spring campground Would recommend Great Algonquin get-a-way! Wonderful Place, Even at -25 Degrees.  Nice and quiet in winter Amazing time, but cold October weekend. Rented a yurt, it was great. There was a lot of highway noise during the day, trail to the water fall was closed due to bear activity. Doesn't have much in it. Beach isn't great. No hiking trails. Beautiful Winter camping is a hoot! Tons of wildlife and trails to explore  Using it for generation.  Beautiful, quiet  Huge camp spot (Translated by Google) Many people a lot of come and go.

Small campground with not much privacy Been coming here now 4 years every Canada day week till the next weekend love it nice park no robo cop kids in there bulletproof vest coming up to your fire when your just sitting talking telling you to keep it down definitely a vary decent park nice beach lots to do around and in the park Really nice to have a separate no radio/dog free area. Lake is beautiful but i dont recommend swimming in it. Fyi theres only 1 public washroom in the whole campground, but there are outposts. Lots of different kinds of birds and chipmunks around. We enjoyed our stay! Great place to get away from it all showers and laundry facilities on site friendly staff open in winter too for the adventurous type The water was amazing and I saw that there were camp signs right by the water saw plenty of people canoeing swimming and fishing Dirty washrooms where taps not functioning and toilets are clogged even after telling park people few times. Bathrooms are never cleaned and too much gunk inside. 

I saw people drinking in bathroom area two nights in a row. I told the … I'm not a fan of car camping but this is a.good campground.  I use it as a jump off.to the interior if I arrive too late to hit the trails Great area. A lot of trails close to Campground. Clean and altogether enjoyable. This is my favourite place, get your own. Our family loves this campground! The bathrooms are clean, showers have nice, hot water and the hospitality station is great too! It's fairly central to most hiking trails which is a bonus. Great camp site. Quite and peaceful. Right by water. Great park. Great trails for byke and walking Relaxing great trails, wild life galore saw moose and calf.  Yurt Camping is easy in the snow and melting snow Amazing!! Little too close to highwa Damn good site... but the shower room water is way too hot... Loved the campground. Roomy sites, clean comfort station and courteous staff! Nice campsites with good lake access and decent privacy. Only drawback is that the highway is right across the lake and is fairly loud. People were great,lake close by. The annual place to camp during the  winter season. Was told by the park help I had to wait until 8am to check out before I could leave as I arrived late. I had planned to be on the road by 6:30. Waited until 8:30 by the time they got the computers going for them to ask me my site # and say thanks have a nice day. Will not use again if I cannot arrive before 7pm love the gonk! Excellent place for all ages We make a yearly visit to this campground. We also enjoy renting the Yurts in the winter for a family camp out. Beautiful campground. The radio free zone is always my favourite area to camp. The little lake is so nice to way up to. This is a beautiful campground. We saw a family of ducks. My cousin saw a moose and another camper saw a beaver. We stayed at 114 in the radio and dog free zone. The frog symphony played us to sleep. The beach is lovely. Wish it had brought my paddle board. Love this park. Park staff and host, Tom we so helpful. Great for car camping, great sites and some sites are off of mew lake. 

Washrooms are a little outdated. great site overall Very well looked after. A bit close to the highway though. The perfect place to go winter camping, especially if you have kids. Heated washrooms, running water, a community ice rink and warming tent are all available at Mew Lake. A great place for a winter getaway.  This campground has a warm comfort station,  gorgeous views, and a skating rink for lots of winter fun. We had a quiet spot without many campers around, but we could hear people across the lake. Come prepared with fire starters though because the wood from the park store is damp.  Great clean park Always loved this place! Great place. Beautiful layout, easy to register and get into. No issues whatsoever. Our favorite Algonquin camping site!. The dog and radio free area offers very secluded sites. Much quieter than the other nearby campgrounds. It is about 10 minutes by bike along a beautiful wooded trail to get to the main camp store. Mew lake has a nice beach area and access to the railway walking/cycling trail. Enjoyed the dog and radio free area with it's secluded sites. While the park has sites with electricity they are not within this area and are not nearly as secluded. If you can live without electricity and do not have pets this is great place to visit. Really nice camp sites on he water, but mine was too close to the highway so the road noise was a bit loud. Algonquin is a beautiful gem. Mew Lake is an excellent spot for car camping and has beautiful views. Only downfall is it is too close to highway 60'and there is road noise. Mew Lake Campground is a pretty nice spot.  
Choose your site wisely because there are wide variety.
My spot on this stay was across the lake from the Highway so there was a lot of traffic noise into the early evening.
Otherwise, the … Nice site (107) with a view of the water, but too close to the highway for our preferences. ... This campground is absolutely magical in Winter though (stayed in one of the yurts in February) Huge sites and the campground was beautiful Nice campgrounds. Water is cold in the lake. Too much mosquitoes Great camping. Large lots. Good showers. We went family day weekend, I was surprised with just  how many people camp in the winter.  And they were having  a whole winter festival in too. Enjoyed a winter weekend in one of the yurts. Loved it - great for cross-country skiing, outdoor cooking over a fire and there was even a skating rink. Heater in the yurt was great, but it struggled to fight the cold outside (below -25 Celcius overnight) so be prepared with lots of warm gear! good place Large sites, quiet in winter, heated comfort stations. Open all year round Quite, beautiful, lots of empty camping areas Nice for camping. We recommend a yurt. Beautiful!! The campsites are huge! A quiet campground..can't wait to come back! 😁 Great time winter camping. Relaxing and quiet. Washrooms in bad state! Clean nice park Love the sites Great time. 🔥🏕️ Mew Lake Campground keeps one electric sector open all year around. It is relatively small and cozy. Most of the sites have good size.  Summer or winter it's a great campground. Beautiful lake.. A bit close to highway Great for winter hikes. The only campground open year round as their comfort stations are winterized. Not as quiet as I had expected. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. Honor system for firewood is very good.  Great place to camp if you like wildlife.  There's usually a warning about black bears in the area.  Some of the people who camp here leave a lot of garbage and have little respect for other campers though. really wonderful and quiet place. Especially nice to see in the fall when the colours change. TONS of great trails nearby too Was covered in ice and no salt options available in the camp ground Great experience here. Clean fresh air, with water on all  3 sides. The ground is very soft for the tent peg to go in. I survived - 47C with wind chill in a hot tent, and got to see a woodpecker to boot! Fantastic visitor center. The viewpoints are amazing fore wildlife. Especially in winter, Great camping site, small, but private. The only issue is that being close to the highway, you can hear the occasional truck at night, other than that, this has been my favourite camp site so far. Beautiful spring ;) It was a decent campground. Not very large in size. We camped in the radio free, dog free zone. The site we had was nice, had a slight view of the lake. You could hear the highway traffic from our sight. Not super noticable though, but … Beautiful campground Excellent camp.
Lots of animals, a lake and in a fantastic location.
Hot showers and proper bathrooms etc. A beautiful and affordable campsite on the lakeshore, close to several hiking trails and a short drive from the Algonquin Visitor's Centre. Beach nearby Great place. Well looked after. Great people. I've been to Mew Lake a few times, and each time it's a great experience. Try to get site 96 or 97, they're great! Beautiful area and a great campground. Campsites around 119 can see and hear wild cars roaming around highway 60. Quite and peaceful but a lot of Mosquitoes ! I love this place. We go throughout the summer and bathe in the fields of blueberries as we watch bears wander past in the distance and then in October we bring the kids there to camp and trick or treat. Amazing time in the fall. So many colours. Truly breathtaking  The usual experience Great access to trails,and bike trail.  Few nice sites with some privacy Came here for a party, left satisfied and happy. The park is beautiful along with lake.  Non reservable placdes arent always marked as such. Amazing time with the family Good to sit on the Beach for long time in a deep fall. Decent sites but close to highway and as a result is very noisy from the traffic. Central location on HWY 60 is convenient for accessing the hikes and Visitor Centre Very clean and natural. All Algonquin parks are great. Great hiking, biking options Will come agaim for.sure! Walked about 6 kms on a trail from the campground. Lots of snow!  Nice shower with heated floor. nice campground in general, but the quiet zone is the zone closest to the highway. Beautiful We had something stolen from our tent overnight.  Beautiful sites, but has some minimal highway noise. Good view and nice hosts... Our favorite Spring campground Would recommend Great Algonquin get-a-way! Wonderful Place, Even at -25 Degrees.  Nice and quiet in winter Amazing time, but cold October weekend. Rented a yurt, it was great. There was a lot of highway noise during the day, trail to the water fall was closed due to bear activity. Doesn't have much in it. Beach isn't great. No hiking trails. Beautiful Winter camping is a hoot! Tons of wildlife and trails to explore  Using it for generation.  Beautiful, quiet  Huge camp spot (Translated by Google) Many people a lot of come and go.

The bugs are bad this year but that didn't take away from the spot. We'll be back. Fall colors are always best at Tea Lake Campground. Camp ground is close to beautiful lake and scenery but it is too close to the main road and you will hear cars passing. Lovely colors at this time of the year Ok campground. Small. Washrooms are filthy 24/7. No privacy. Highway is close and loud. Good spot for tenting. a little crowded and the people at the front desk didn't know there where trout in Algonquin park :( Good place Rude staff and dirty washrooms With only 43 sites, the campground was very peaceful and nice. The beach was a little rocky, but still had sand and with a small lake is usually quite warm. They haven't had a bear visit in 8 years if that is a concern! Not bad not far from bathroom and lake not much for animals the bears are further east the lady said seen one in 5 years Really clean Awesome Algonquin Friendly and prompt",45.51269,-78.7204878

I loved the rink in the forest but wish it was a little longer! Still super fun and reasonably priced as well for the day pass! Hiking trails were also a blast and we didn’t even need snow shoes! Perfect place for the little adventurers out there :) We arrived at a good time. The fall colours were just coming into their own and the crowds were kept to a minimum. The trails were easy and scenic. There were a couple of trails closed due to maintenance that seemed to be slow on the maintenance. I actually picked up a lot of downed limbs and trees myself. Cross country skiing was fun, $30 for day pass for two people plus $45 for two people to rent skis, poles and boots. Nice Visitor centre but was truly busy by 1pm. Wished the skating trail was open but we came early in the season. Worth a visit and hope to come back during the warm months! Went in the winter to the skating Trail. It was magical. What a beautiful way to enjoy skating. Weekends get busy so go early to find a parking spot. They also have a fire pit so bring warm clothes so you can stay awhile. Great winter cabins! Very cozy! Hiking relatively easy if you don't want to rent snowshoes or skis...but you can! As a winter adventure(Really can't speak to summer) this place is top notch. Quiet, clean and lots of activities and places to get warm. Friendly staff too!
We'll be back! Lovely park, worth exploring in the winter too... tons to do. Went in Sept last year and the bugs were surprisingly brutal for that time of year. Campsites aren't stacked on top of one another which is awesome. Usually a back country camper but this was a great place for car camping. Friendly staff, clean, quiet. Fire and Ice is an awesome experience. Worth the drive. Not the smoothest ice but you're skating through a forest trail!!! Also some parts are slightly uphill and others slightly downhill (I advise knowing how to slow yourself down) love going here in the winter to ski. trails are great and well marked. new lodge building is very nice. Also skated on the ice skating trail that runs in the woods and it was good too but of course bumpy. Have skated on the track several times. Great place for family fun. So many things to do. New   Lodge is awesome. Amazing experience. We did Fire & Ice night skating and it was awesome. Torches lighting up the ice trail was awesome and even though it was Saturday night, it wasn't as packed as i expected it to be. My parents would take my brother and I camping here every summer. I like to camp in more secluded areas and they offer quite a few sites with a lot of privacy. Canoe rentals are safe and fairly priced. I love the bike trails, beaches, ... One of my favourite parks in Ontario. Great way to spend a week or a Weekend.  Camping sites afford enough privacy to make one feel as being one with the surrounding wilderness,  but with the reassuring knowledge that the comfort station ... If you will be camping with your dog, pick a location close to the ""Pet Exercise Area"". You can enjoy sandy beach areas where your dog can go in the water with you and run around. Also try a rope from one tree to another with a carabiner for your dog to roam tangle free as dogs must be leashed at camp all sites. We planned our trip one week in advance. Luckily the weather was really good. Snow was fresh. They have very proper arrangements for skates, skating trial, skies, sking trials, lockers, washrooms . Good warm area to help you stay warm. Looking forward for our next trip. Arrowhead park has a great trail system and an overall great camping experience. The new Welcome Centre is excellent with a great space to warm up in the winter and get year round rentals. Staff are super friendly and helpful! Rented a cabin here twice, very cozy this weekend while in the -20's . Ski trails are awesome, 1.3km ice skating trail (clean by zamboni) is very good and night skating in torchlightis pretty cool. Comfort station and warming fires also. Snow shoeing trails I have yet to do. Nice little park, the river bend is a must see when visiting Arrowhead. Hiking trails are good and for the average to moderate hikers. The campsite are good and have good privacy. The washrooms need a little update, the taps would not hold the water running for more than 2 seconds. Overall a nice place. This park at fall time is absolutely beautiful! The change in tree colours and the reflection of it makes it a perfect getaway from the city or to enjoy a nice day in the nature. There is a lot of camping spots and parking available in ... Large, beautiful sites for camping, gorgeous beaches and lots of fun things to do with kids.  However, there are far too many outhouses that need to be changed to flush toilets on the camping roads.  The beaches also really need to have ... My favourite provincial parks.  Big, clean, well maintained RV lots and lots of hiking trails.  We will be back. I have camped here three times, all in the East River campground. All three campsites were spacious and well maintained. Two inner sites (#326 & #333) were quite private and located well apart from neighbours, but the other (#347) near ... I love this place! It's one of the nicer provincial parks with reach of toronto! The trails are picturesque and their winter activities are super. If you are thinking about it try their roofed cabin accommodations. They may be a little pricey but they are great! View is awesome. Pictures are in my laptop but something you really going to enjoy with your eyes. Must visit place for fall Such a beautiful provincial park during the fall season. 

The prime time to visit and witness all the trees changing colour is mid-october. 

The park is very well taken care of, the atmosphere is gentle and free from societal smells and sound. 

Don't miss out on arrowhead provincial park or you'll ACTUALLY regret it! Great time skating the trail. Can't wait to do it again. Beautiful park with great hiking trails extraordinary views. Carefull to not be here on humid days hiking... You will have a lot of mosquito friends... AMAZING night skating.... hiked to stubb falls! Great little trail. We took our children camping here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The best thing here is location, being 10 minutes from all the restaurants of Huntsville meaning no more cooking and eating in a tent when it is ... Best hangout spot just 2 hours drive from Toronto and in winter it’s best to do ski and skating Awesome experience. People were there to guide for skieng. Will be visiting again One of the most beautiful site in Ontario had many interesting things to know and see... Also there is a very nice campground in the heart of that interesting area. Most beautiful sites I've ever seen  i totally recommend this camp ground for everyone each sites are spaced out really good to give privacy to you to us as well as they have  a lot of amazing hiking trails. you can also go canoe ... Absolutely amazing camp ground. This place has the best Northern beach area I've ever been to. No weeds, no rocks gorgeous beach, clean water so enjoyable. Down side is the signage isn't the best for navigation while inside the park. Some of the washroom facilities are not the best but an amazing park. Beautiful park. Clean and well kept. Very good trails. Our dog loves the dog beaches especially the one at the far end of Arrowhead lake. We'll be back! It's nice but started to rain soon after we got there. Lake is nice too. Didn't find any high grounds to shoot fall colors. Beautiful park.  Great river for kayaking with first-time kids.  Decent beaches, hiking trails, and super private sites in the east river section.  Minutes to Huntsville if you need ice cream. Lots of activity to do seems like a beatiful place in summer Amazing park in the winter time!  We came up here to go skating in the forest.... that’s right in the middle of the forest!! It was great!  Make sure to come earlier as it gets quite busy! Beautiful trails. Very well organized Nice place to camp with kids. Beaches are small and safe. Had a great time at Arrowhead Provincial Park. The washrooms were older but cleaned daily. The showers did flood up the whole room and had no ventilation. The lot sizes were large and very shaded which helped on the hot days. This is a ... Had a great time even though it rained for 14 hours on Wednesday. Hard to navigate through this place to find anything though. Great trails and a great place for the dog to swim and play. Wish I could have stayed longer. I'll be back next year. Beautiful park, very well maintained, fantastic and helpful staff. Beaches are pretty nice. Went mostly for some hiking trails. The trails are pretty nice but wish they were marked better. Hard to tell which trail was what. The falls trail is nice, a beautiful lookout spot Fantastic in winter. We mainly come skating on a  skating trail, which runs through the forest. I love this provincial park but this year it seems a bit disorganized. They're switching around the park stores to their new building at beach 2 but the transition is pretty bumpy. Quiet and great for families - the fishing this week was ... Went out camping here with my 5 year old for the weekend. The parks is nice. The sites are very spread out which is great as you don't feel like you are sharing a site with others. Now for the not so great stuff. The non comfort station ... Beautiful, and the bugs; the relaxing buzz of a warm blanket of bugs... An absolute visit in the falls when the local trees are in full colour... Something just short of heaven! The best cross country ski trails in the area. And, the cabins are perfect for renting! And, don't forget to try out the circular custom skating track they maintain. So much fun. Nice park but signage sucks and the map isn't very helpful either.  Very easy to get lost. Too much time spent trying to find stuff.  Dog exercise area is very nice, beach like. Great place for Nordic Skiing, snowshoeing and skating. The ice trail was a great family outing. It’s so beautiful up here! Beautiful place not too far from the city. In the week not as busy compared to weekend but the spots are relatively private and easy to set up in. The lake is pretty and good for a canoe, Nice beaches and the hikes have good views. Stubb's Falls is a must see on the hike. A nice place. A lot of poison ivy all over, even in the camping areas. You need to keep your pets and children away from it. Nice sites, nice swimming, nice hiking, nice facilities. Over the hill so you don’t get highway noise (it is quiet), yet close to town if you want to explore. This park checks all the boxes!  A favourite for frontcountry camping! We had a wonderful experience at this park! The park is just stunning. We took our own kayaks with us and went out on the water. It was a cold weekend (May24 weekend) but kids were still swimming. Easy to park, easy to navigate, would recommend this park if you are looking for some calm kayaking or swimming. This provincial park {part of the extensive Ontario park system] offers nature lovers some wonderful experiences--- whether in winter , for cross country skiing, skating... and in the summer the swimming in pristine circumstances are ... Great family friendly cross country ski facility. We enjoyed a sweltering June weekend here in our six man tent....Large, private, quiet camp sites in a beautiful wilderness setting. The trees are tall, the sand is fine and golden, and the water warm and inviting. The highlight of our ... An awesome place for all seasons.... Loved the place and the lake at night was beautiful ❤️ Created some beautiful memories. Great park with some nice hikes. Only issue was that the bugs (mosquitoes and black flies) were just horrible at this time of year (late June). Nothing park can do about that but a warning for anybody planning to go up then. Also check process needs to be streamlined when it gets busy despite it not being the high season. Lovely place. It was my second time here and we had a cabin. Very convenient and comfortable.  The only concern is all cabins are located inside ""radio free"" zone. Means no music/dance/ even hard laughing at all! That is weird to me that ... Great place to go camping, canoeing, and the Big Bend is a peaceful and wonderful natural phenomenon Love how big and private the sites are. The new store is convenient if you forgot something from home, but its not too big. It has ice so that is a bonus! Overall a great park.
Lots of dog restrictions.
But still many trails for hiking and access to water. 
Was there early October. Colors ar beautiful and its less crowded.

#kanukontheroad
#puppy_whiskey Great campground for family fun. We couldn't find a play structure for our three year old, but it didn't matter because the water was so warm and clean that we spent most of our time in the lake. Nice campsites, clean comfort stations, and great staff! They have a very nice dog swimming area as well. Park is nice but the sites are tough to get into with a 24ft travel trailer.  The sites are listed for trailers this size but there is very little space to back up and maneuvre the trailer in.  You can get in with the help of someone ... It was our first time to Arrowhead and we loved it. Very private sites. Only downfall was are friends were staying in a different row there is no short cut access had to walk all the way to the end and Down to the next area all the way down. Stayed at Arrowhead Provincial Park for a few nights with some friends. Amazing scenery with lots of things to which makes for a great getaway for family and friends. Just make sure you bring bug spray, many bugs near the lakes for sure ... We stayed in South Lumby. Sites were spacious, flat and mostly sandy. The comfort station there was ok. Showers were intense. Both extremely cold water, and a stream of water that could nearly remove skin! Beaches were busy but nice. ... Arrowhead is always a favorite. Big bend lookout is a breath taking view and stubbs falls is amazing. The 3 other trails are good as well. Favorite section is roe. But east river and lumby are nice as well. New park store is nice as well. Really nice park. Unfortunately there isn't much enforcement on loud screaming children and families who don't have respect for other campers. I'd come back, but would make sure the park is high in vacancy. I would so love to Winter Camp here the kids would love to be here on weekends. The cabins are great for winter camping. Beautiful park. Nice beaches. Not as much dog friendly areas as I would like. Sites are quite private. There is a lot of Poison Ivy to be aware of. And a crazy amount of black flies and mosquitoes. Deer flies are annoying by the beach as ... Big private sites in East River section. Well maintained and friendly staff. Have been here numerous times. Never disappointed. Beautiful park. Excellent hiking Skating at night. Awesome. Great experience at Arrowhead.  Deep private sites at the Roe camp ground.  Beautiful beaches and a good sized dog beach.  Plenty of hiking trails. We rented the cabins and they were great! Beauty hike around the lake. Not big, but a great spot to explore when you don't have a lot of time Beautiful large sites, great beaches and hiking trails, clean rest stations, dog friendly. Wonderful provincial park! Been coming here for years. Large private campsites, nice beaches, trails, beautiful scenery. Would defiantly recommend checking it out Lovely park, well worth a visit. There are lots of trails to follow and lots of beautiful scenery . We love Arrowhead - its nicely laid out, great sites, and easy to get to. We stayed at Roe campground in site 400 - super private but an easy walk to the vault toilets (which were actually flushable and had a sink - a nice surprise). My ... Ice trail was really great! This park is well organised. There are several beaches. Tons of campsites and quite a few hikes. In the winter there are several cross country ski trails. There is also a really cool ice skating loop. Stubb's falls trail has a really nice (but popular) waterfall. The big bend lookout is worth the 5 minutes of your time! Beautiful Beaches and hiking trails. Only complaint is some of the sites are not very private. Otherwise it is a great park to visit. Great experience. Camping here was fun. Very clean campsites. Torch lit skate was amazing. Ice conditions were perfect. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing is great when whether permits. Very affordable. Would recommend for a fun affordable family outing. Cabins are expensive and book up very ... Very private campsites. Absolutely the best provincial park around that hasn't butchered their park into a camping parking lot. They have maintained a rustic feel. East River campsites are the best - you literally cannot see your closest ... Stayed here a few times and just love it❤ Very nice. Wish there was more showers and on site canoe rentals.

Otherwise beautiful park. I love the way it's full of bushes and trees . 
Clean washrooms and nice walking trails. As beautiful and scenic as this place may be there is an equally good chance that you will return home stricken with mosquito bites unless u have dabbed yourself with sufficient insect repellent cream all over. ALL OVER!!! Great family time and experience It's 6 degrees
 Can't ski, can't skate, can snowshoe. But managed to hike 6 km Very large park that is well kept. The skating loop through the trees is beautiful but we had gone when the weather was starting to warm up so the ice was pretty bad and I decided to walk after doing one lap. There is a trail close to the ice loop that leads to a small waterfall that is really nice. Great provincial park for families. Large sandy beaches, peaceful canoeing down the river to get to stubbes falls. Go here every year and every year I have a blast there is so much to do here. It truly is one of the best provincial parks in all of Canada you will never be bored here. One of my favorite places to camp, sites are(for the most part) fair sized and private...the beaches are awesome and usually relatively quiet. The trails here are amazing with many picturesque views along the way as well as a few ... Top 3 favourite campground of all time! Highly recommend sites in the Roe area. Fantastic spot. Campsites are not on top of each other. Many activities available The park’s leniency with excessive noise at night is very unacceptable. Out of all the parks that I have been to, that was the first time that I witnessed a park staff who just basically drove by and didn’t do anything to control the ... It's a good park but could do with some fixes for the disabled as the disabled bathroom and disabled shower do not have any signs on state that it is a disabled wash my shower and the paths to some of the beaches should be fixed as they are not very accessible for people that are disabled but other than that its a good park Arrowhead is a great place to spend a few days with the family and my two dogs. Be sure to check out the Big Lookout, Stubbs Falls and the brand new visitors center. A beautiful park, with great trails, a gorgeous amber lake, a waterfall, and lots of great trees. Nice hiking trails and the beach were clean. Love this park for camping! Love this park.  Kids love the lake.  Campsites have a good amount of privacy. Campsites here are more secluded than some of the other provincial parks. The park is very run down (lots of dead trees standing and bush over growth...and therefore bugs). My reason for giving 1 star is that while we where on our campsite a 30 foot tree fell on our site and knocked down and broke a fire pit ... Great fun in the winter! Friendly helpful staff, great facilities Love it here my fave place...wish all bathrooms would be updated with sinks. Staff are awesome Amazing and breathtaking! Can cant to head back again next year! 

P.s these pictures dont do justice! Beautiful campground. We stayed in campsite 147, a big site in the South Lumby area that was free of mud and quite flat. Very short walk to one of the beaches on the lake, which is perfect if you have young kids or dogs or both as we do. ... Have been to many provincial parks in Ontario, this is one of the best! Very close to ON 11, wonderful park. Easy hikes with option of parking close to attractions if one doesnt want to hike. 
Washrooms at regular intervals, clean flush ... Beautiful park, full rv sites, quiet tenting sites. Mountain bike trails,winter skating and cross country trails One of the best parks in Ontario for access to an awesome river, nice sandy beaches and Huntsville is 10 min away if the weather is not favorable. Amazing place. In fall especially, with all the amazing fall colors. Really recommend this place! Great park. Close to town in case you forgot something or you need to shop. Have been to this park almost every year since 1996. We have checked out many parks in Ontario and Arrowhead is by far our favourite vacation spot. The new cabins are geat! Well priced and has everything you need. It's lazy camping at ... Lovely to hike and bike. Lots of trail options. Great dog beach, beautiful camp sites with enough space for privacy, multiple beaches for swimming, great hikes and biking trails for people who like a challenge. Fun, but busy. Our favourite campground! Feels in the middle of nowhere with amenities nearby in case of emergency or convenience! The cabins here are the absolute best. It's like testing out a tiny home. It has everything we needed - even a screened in porch for reading at night, and a BBQ for cooking food, a kettle for making hot drinks, and a mini fridge to keep our food cold. Glamping at its best. Awesome spot for hiking and snow shoeing! Don’t miss the frozen waterfall, it’s a must see! It's was very crowded on the Shore like elbow to Elbow but once you got on to the lake it was very peaceful. The fishing was ok. Beautiful park. Very family friendly, great beaches Wonderful place to visit. I would like to go there for camping again and again. Huge park with nice camping sites, trails, lakes and river bends. It's comfortable with clean washrooms and showers. It's very good to take rest with family or/friends. Arrowhead Lake is quiet and good for kayaking, canoe or stand-up paddleboarding! I am going to vizit it again and again!!! Great camping close to home Easy drive from Toronto, kids friendly, lots of things to do, nice small beachs, nice waterfall hike and Big band lookout, must visit. Camping experience. We rented a log cabin. Easy use for parents with young children. Nearby town is also nice to visit. This is a beautiful park to visit in the winters. The skating trail is a great experience to skate among the woods. Fairly flat and easy to do for all levels. We  did not see much food or drink options to make sure to pack some. We stayed at Lumby, site 141. We really liked our site, good privacy, nice scenery, very close to the outhouses. A few minute walk to the beach (really nice beach areas), 10 min walk to the comfort station. We visited the ampitheatre for ... We came to spend the day at the beach and bbq. There were picnic shelters but no where to dispose of the garbage . 
Water was clean and overall we had fun. beautiful park, staff was super friendly and helpful...only downfall was being eaten alive by the mosquitoes and deer flies which is completely normal at the time of year.  I would love to go back for the day when the leaves are changing colour A great park to explore for the day! Terribale experience, during the day all you hear is the highway, during the night all you hear is the highway and honking and a really loud non stop trains. I was suppose to stay Monday to Thursday but I left Wednesday. I drove 2 hours ... I got a cabin and it was awesome! Will definitely get it again! Excellent park for biking and hiking. Clean bathrooms. Bit disappointed no kids program this year during the week. Very private, and very public. Bring tents or a trailer tho. If you hammock camp like I do you will find your limited on the sites where you can place a hammock Perfect spot for friends and family. Proximity to Huntsville is a huge advantage. Worth visiting if you are in the GTA. Highly recommend visiting in the winter for ice skating! Great size lots with lots of privacy and shade. Lots of trails for biking and hiking. Beautiful lake with small but clean beaches. However there were alot of dogs so we did here alot of barking during the day. We also did not appreciate ... Nice beach, Lumby campground is buggy especially after any rainfall. Lovely park but the trails are not well signposted. Second time I've visited arrowhead provincial park and it's absolutely magical. This year we went and the skating wasn't open yet but that didn't matter to us! Snowshoeing was just as Fun, so many laughs as you're trying to walk in the ... This is a very nice park and well worth visiting. I think their reservation fee for camping that is in addition to the camping fee itself is greedy and ridiculous. Take a cc for guarantee people. The park is beautiful in the summer, and last week I came out for the skating trail and it did not disappoint! The rental skates were really nice, park staff were friendly and for the rainy weather they had gotten the past few days, the ... Great campsites and trails Beaches and the water quality are A++
Maintenance and the campsites are A++
My concern is about showers!
1- only 5 for a big group of campsite (all campgrounds are the same)
2- very high pressure and tooooo- long time of shower.
3- ... Modest camping with excellent trails, I highly recommend bringing/renting bikes for their trails Park was closed and my daughter and I just went in for a hike beautiful place. Quiet peaceful beautiful sceneries and easily navigated trails Fire and Ice and tubing are not to be missed Amazing park! Beautiful. Fantastic swimming area! Park was nice and the hiking trails were well maintained, however the staff was not very friendly or welcoming. Huntsville is nice but the park the sites are really close together. The washrooms were not maintained either Loads of things to do whenever your there! Great park for a getaway from the city, lots of activities to do there and lots of places where you can stay nearby the park Really nice park with a great swimming spot for kids. Great park .  We stayed one night. Little loud after 10pm in the no radio section but it was a holiday weekend. Great place to go cross country skiing! The skating track is really fun too, but it gets old after an hour or so. If you're going on a weekend, get there early because the park fills up quickly. Our second time renting the cabins and we loved it.  The staff is not very helpful tho and the washrooms are not well maintained near our cabin. Wonderful campground and close enough to Huntsville for dinner or shopping Clean showers and friendly stuff. Theres nowhere to buy food so make sure you bring enough Amazing experience.  Great facilities!  I hope all visitors will help keep it that way for years and years to come.  We only got to use the skating trail, but our family was out all there all day. Skate trail is awesome. Beautiful view. Seemed flatter this year. Disappointed tubing was closed due to maintenance. But definitely good family fun. Loved this park, large private site, lots of trails. I very much enjoyed my visit. Very disappointed. The park was poorly maintained and the trails full of trash. Ended up in Algonquin where it was so much better. Big private sites. Great trails. Friendly helpful staff. Really nice spot. Had a great time here kayaking . Nice size sites very private. Swim, fish ,and canoe Very nice and safe camping site... We had visited the park before, but, like so many other Ontario parks, their ""strict enforcement"" of leash and other dog policies or the use of generators are at best a joke. 
While the park is beautiful, and the staff friendly, ignorant campers ruin it for those who came to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. Nice park dogs enjoyed the beach. Have only gone on a hike at Arrowhead its nice but trail is so close to the campsites that all you can hear. Lots of trails though the one we wanted to hike was closed but not posted on line. We’ve gone back here for many years now.  Great cross-country trails, with excellent trail grooming!  Ice skating trail is still fairly original as well. Went in the beginning of December. There was some decent snow, enough for snowshoeing fun but most other activities were closed. The heated showers and washrooms on- site were perfect retreats after completing the activities. I would ... Rented a cabin for the Canada day weekend.  Had a great time hiking, swimming and exploring the park.  It was a busy weekend but we'll definitely be back. Just stayed overnight, and would like to return for a longer stay. Hiking trails and lake look appealing! 2 rivers, 2 lakes, large private sites.  very quiet and beautiful. Went camping was very fun and nice campsite definitely suggest you go here Ice skating proved to be smoother than thought, only half of the ski trails were track set which was disappointing. Also there must be a lot of snow for them to open up the tubing so it is unlikely you will get to experience it. If you ... Fabulous place in the winter. Great ice skating trail in the forest! They seemed to have good snowshoeing and cross-country ski trails. No snack bar tho so bring food and a thermos. Great place. However, this experience was not a good one! We arrived a little late, and after renting skates, the guy immediately said ""you have 10 minutes to skate"". Why let people pay full rental and then tell them they've got a few minutes to use them? That's classless! And we weren't able to get our money back either. Still the best place to swim and relax Snow shoeing and skating was a blast. Love this place, well maintained, great trails, nice lake for canoeing and fishing. Must go see Stubbs falls while there. The park closes soon as compared to being a part of the major tourist spot in Ontario Great spot for camping. Good hiking trails and good terrain for biking as well. The falls are definitely worth the time. The lake is nice too, though it is on the small side. Great park with lots of trails and interesting things to see! We spent the week-end there,had a great camp site.Loved the showers,nice and clean.And a good sandy beach,would recommend visiting Stubbs Falls.Mosquitos were the only annoying thing. Beautiful lake, clean sites and washrooms. Beware poison ivy Stayed in a camp cabin close to a nice clean comfort station.  Good privacy and quiet location.  Some wildlife sightings (hare, deer) Great park...very few like it Great campground. Lots of trails for walking, hiking and biking. Canoe rentals. Great speckled trout stocked lake, great eating if you catch them. Beaches are nice as well. Cabins to rent also. Perfect size, it has a number of trails and waterfalls and well as a look out point. We stayed here is July with our 3 year old with a tent trailer and absolutely loved it. We were in site 478 and it was a great site. VERY large and super clean. Lots of fun things to do at the park and in town. Beaches are great and clean.  Enjoyed our day spent at Arrow Park. It's worth the visit. I think I'll go check it out in the summer time. Great place for photography Everything was just perfect. Amazing beach, clean showers, clean washrooms, friendly staff, BUT mosquitos are pains in the neck.

Three sand beaches on Arrowhead Lake
Quiet motorboat-free lakes
15 km of hiking trails; including a trail leading to a waterfall
Remains of old homesteads from the 1870’s
Rental canoes, kayaks and mountain bikes during the summer season; skis, snowshoes and ice skate rentals during the winter
Well-known for winter activities; skiing, snowshoeing, skating, tubingSo fun!!! I loved the rink in the forest but wish it was a little longer! Still super fun and reasonably priced as well for the day pass! Hiking trails were also a blast and we didn’t even need snow shoes! Perfect place for the little adventurers out there :) We arrived at a good time. The fall colours were just coming into their own and the crowds were kept to a minimum. The trails were easy and scenic. There were a couple of trails closed due to maintenance that seemed to be slow on the maintenance. I actually picked up a lot of downed limbs and trees myself. Cross country skiing was fun, $30 for day pass for two people plus $45 for two people to rent skis, poles and boots. Nice Visitor centre but was truly busy by 1pm. Wished the skating trail was open but we came early in the season. Worth a visit and hope to come back during the warm months! Went in the winter to the skating Trail. It was magical. What a beautiful way to enjoy skating. Weekends get busy so go early to find a parking spot. They also have a fire pit so bring warm clothes so you can stay awhile. Great winter cabins! Very cozy! Hiking relatively easy if you don't want to rent snowshoes or skis...but you can! As a winter adventure(Really can't speak to summer) this place is top notch. Quiet, clean and lots of activities and places to get warm. Friendly staff too!
We'll be back! Lovely park, worth exploring in the winter too... tons to do. Went in Sept last year and the bugs were surprisingly brutal for that time of year. Campsites aren't stacked on top of one another which is awesome. Usually a back country camper but this was a great place for car camping. Friendly staff, clean, quiet. Fire and Ice is an awesome experience. Worth the drive. Not the smoothest ice but you're skating through a forest trail!!! Also some parts are slightly uphill and others slightly downhill (I advise knowing how to slow yourself down) love going here in the winter to ski. trails are great and well marked. new lodge building is very nice. Also skated on the ice skating trail that runs in the woods and it was good too but of course bumpy. Have skated on the track several times. Great place for family fun. So many things to do. New   Lodge is awesome. Amazing experience. We did Fire & Ice night skating and it was awesome. Torches lighting up the ice trail was awesome and even though it was Saturday night, it wasn't as packed as i expected it to be. My parents would take my brother and I camping here every summer. I like to camp in more secluded areas and they offer quite a few sites with a lot of privacy. Canoe rentals are safe and fairly priced. I love the bike trails, beaches, ... One of my favourite parks in Ontario. Great way to spend a week or a Weekend.  Camping sites afford enough privacy to make one feel as being one with the surrounding wilderness,  but with the reassuring knowledge that the comfort station ... If you will be camping with your dog, pick a location close to the ""Pet Exercise Area"". You can enjoy sandy beach areas where your dog can go in the water with you and run around. Also try a rope from one tree to another with a carabiner for your dog to roam tangle free as dogs must be leashed at camp all sites. We planned our trip one week in advance. Luckily the weather was really good. Snow was fresh. They have very proper arrangements for skates, skating trial, skies, sking trials, lockers, washrooms . Good warm area to help you stay warm. Looking forward for our next trip. Arrowhead park has a great trail system and an overall great camping experience. The new Welcome Centre is excellent with a great space to warm up in the winter and get year round rentals. Staff are super friendly and helpful! Rented a cabin here twice, very cozy this weekend while in the -20's . Ski trails are awesome, 1.3km ice skating trail (clean by zamboni) is very good and night skating in torchlightis pretty cool. Comfort station and warming fires also. Snow shoeing trails I have yet to do. Nice little park, the river bend is a must see when visiting Arrowhead. Hiking trails are good and for the average to moderate hikers. The campsite are good and have good privacy. The washrooms need a little update, the taps would not hold the water running for more than 2 seconds. Overall a nice place. This park at fall time is absolutely beautiful! The change in tree colours and the reflection of it makes it a perfect getaway from the city or to enjoy a nice day in the nature. There is a lot of camping spots and parking available in ... Large, beautiful sites for camping, gorgeous beaches and lots of fun things to do with kids.  However, there are far too many outhouses that need to be changed to flush toilets on the camping roads.  The beaches also really need to have ... My favourite provincial parks.  Big, clean, well maintained RV lots and lots of hiking trails.  We will be back. I have camped here three times, all in the East River campground. All three campsites were spacious and well maintained. Two inner sites (#326 & #333) were quite private and located well apart from neighbours, but the other (#347) near ... I love this place! It's one of the nicer provincial parks with reach of toronto! The trails are picturesque and their winter activities are super. If you are thinking about it try their roofed cabin accommodations. They may be a little pricey but they are great! View is awesome. Pictures are in my laptop but something you really going to enjoy with your eyes. Must visit place for fall Such a beautiful provincial park during the fall season. 

The prime time to visit and witness all the trees changing colour is mid-october. 

The park is very well taken care of, the atmosphere is gentle and free from societal smells and sound. 

Don't miss out on arrowhead provincial park or you'll ACTUALLY regret it! Great time skating the trail. Can't wait to do it again. Beautiful park with great hiking trails extraordinary views. Carefull to not be here on humid days hiking... You will have a lot of mosquito friends... AMAZING night skating.... hiked to stubb falls! Great little trail. We took our children camping here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The best thing here is location, being 10 minutes from all the restaurants of Huntsville meaning no more cooking and eating in a tent when it is ... Best hangout spot just 2 hours drive from Toronto and in winter it’s best to do ski and skating Awesome experience. People were there to guide for skieng. Will be visiting again One of the most beautiful site in Ontario had many interesting things to know and see... Also there is a very nice campground in the heart of that interesting area. Most beautiful sites I've ever seen  i totally recommend this camp ground for everyone each sites are spaced out really good to give privacy to you to us as well as they have  a lot of amazing hiking trails. you can also go canoe ... Absolutely amazing camp ground. This place has the best Northern beach area I've ever been to. No weeds, no rocks gorgeous beach, clean water so enjoyable. Down side is the signage isn't the best for navigation while inside the park. Some of the washroom facilities are not the best but an amazing park. Beautiful park. Clean and well kept. Very good trails. Our dog loves the dog beaches especially the one at the far end of Arrowhead lake. We'll be back! It's nice but started to rain soon after we got there. Lake is nice too. Didn't find any high grounds to shoot fall colors. Beautiful park.  Great river for kayaking with first-time kids.  Decent beaches, hiking trails, and super private sites in the east river section.  Minutes to Huntsville if you need ice cream. Lots of activity to do seems like a beatiful place in summer Amazing park in the winter time!  We came up here to go skating in the forest.... that’s right in the middle of the forest!! It was great!  Make sure to come earlier as it gets quite busy! Beautiful trails. Very well organized Nice place to camp with kids. Beaches are small and safe. Had a great time at Arrowhead Provincial Park. The washrooms were older but cleaned daily. The showers did flood up the whole room and had no ventilation. The lot sizes were large and very shaded which helped on the hot days. This is a ... Had a great time even though it rained for 14 hours on Wednesday. Hard to navigate through this place to find anything though. Great trails and a great place for the dog to swim and play. Wish I could have stayed longer. I'll be back next year. Beautiful park, very well maintained, fantastic and helpful staff. Beaches are pretty nice. Went mostly for some hiking trails. The trails are pretty nice but wish they were marked better. Hard to tell which trail was what. The falls trail is nice, a beautiful lookout spot Fantastic in winter. We mainly come skating on a  skating trail, which runs through the forest. I love this provincial park but this year it seems a bit disorganized. They're switching around the park stores to their new building at beach 2 but the transition is pretty bumpy. Quiet and great for families - the fishing this week was ... Went out camping here with my 5 year old for the weekend. The parks is nice. The sites are very spread out which is great as you don't feel like you are sharing a site with others. Now for the not so great stuff. The non comfort station ... Beautiful, and the bugs; the relaxing buzz of a warm blanket of bugs... An absolute visit in the falls when the local trees are in full colour... Something just short of heaven! The best cross country ski trails in the area. And, the cabins are perfect for renting! And, don't forget to try out the circular custom skating track they maintain. So much fun. Nice park but signage sucks and the map isn't very helpful either.  Very easy to get lost. Too much time spent trying to find stuff.  Dog exercise area is very nice, beach like. Great place for Nordic Skiing, snowshoeing and skating. The ice trail was a great family outing. It’s so beautiful up here! Beautiful place not too far from the city. In the week not as busy compared to weekend but the spots are relatively private and easy to set up in. The lake is pretty and good for a canoe, Nice beaches and the hikes have good views. Stubb's Falls is a must see on the hike. A nice place. A lot of poison ivy all over, even in the camping areas. You need to keep your pets and children away from it. Nice sites, nice swimming, nice hiking, nice facilities. Over the hill so you don’t get highway noise (it is quiet), yet close to town if you want to explore. This park checks all the boxes!  A favourite for frontcountry camping! We had a wonderful experience at this park! The park is just stunning. We took our own kayaks with us and went out on the water. It was a cold weekend (May24 weekend) but kids were still swimming. Easy to park, easy to navigate, would recommend this park if you are looking for some calm kayaking or swimming. This provincial park {part of the extensive Ontario park system] offers nature lovers some wonderful experiences--- whether in winter , for cross country skiing, skating... and in the summer the swimming in pristine circumstances are ... Great family friendly cross country ski facility. We enjoyed a sweltering June weekend here in our six man tent....Large, private, quiet camp sites in a beautiful wilderness setting. The trees are tall, the sand is fine and golden, and the water warm and inviting. The highlight of our ... An awesome place for all seasons.... Loved the place and the lake at night was beautiful ❤️ Created some beautiful memories. Great park with some nice hikes. Only issue was that the bugs (mosquitoes and black flies) were just horrible at this time of year (late June). Nothing park can do about that but a warning for anybody planning to go up then. Also check process needs to be streamlined when it gets busy despite it not being the high season. Lovely place. It was my second time here and we had a cabin. Very convenient and comfortable.  The only concern is all cabins are located inside ""radio free"" zone. Means no music/dance/ even hard laughing at all! That is weird to me that ... Great place to go camping, canoeing, and the Big Bend is a peaceful and wonderful natural phenomenon Love how big and private the sites are. The new store is convenient if you forgot something from home, but its not too big. It has ice so that is a bonus! Overall a great park.
Lots of dog restrictions.
But still many trails for hiking and access to water. 
Was there early October. Colors ar beautiful and its less crowded.

#kanukontheroad
#puppy_whiskey Great campground for family fun. We couldn't find a play structure for our three year old, but it didn't matter because the water was so warm and clean that we spent most of our time in the lake. Nice campsites, clean comfort stations, and great staff! They have a very nice dog swimming area as well. Park is nice but the sites are tough to get into with a 24ft travel trailer.  The sites are listed for trailers this size but there is very little space to back up and maneuvre the trailer in.  You can get in with the help of someone ... It was our first time to Arrowhead and we loved it. Very private sites. Only downfall was are friends were staying in a different row there is no short cut access had to walk all the way to the end and Down to the next area all the way down. Stayed at Arrowhead Provincial Park for a few nights with some friends. Amazing scenery with lots of things to which makes for a great getaway for family and friends. Just make sure you bring bug spray, many bugs near the lakes for sure ... We stayed in South Lumby. Sites were spacious, flat and mostly sandy. The comfort station there was ok. Showers were intense. Both extremely cold water, and a stream of water that could nearly remove skin! Beaches were busy but nice. ... Arrowhead is always a favorite. Big bend lookout is a breath taking view and stubbs falls is amazing. The 3 other trails are good as well. Favorite section is roe. But east river and lumby are nice as well. New park store is nice as well. Really nice park. Unfortunately there isn't much enforcement on loud screaming children and families who don't have respect for other campers. I'd come back, but would make sure the park is high in vacancy. I would so love to Winter Camp here the kids would love to be here on weekends. The cabins are great for winter camping. Beautiful park. Nice beaches. Not as much dog friendly areas as I would like. Sites are quite private. There is a lot of Poison Ivy to be aware of. And a crazy amount of black flies and mosquitoes. Deer flies are annoying by the beach as ... Big private sites in East River section. Well maintained and friendly staff. Have been here numerous times. Never disappointed. Beautiful park. Excellent hiking Skating at night. Awesome. Great experience at Arrowhead.  Deep private sites at the Roe camp ground.  Beautiful beaches and a good sized dog beach.  Plenty of hiking trails. We rented the cabins and they were great! Beauty hike around the lake. Not big, but a great spot to explore when you don't have a lot of time Beautiful large sites, great beaches and hiking trails, clean rest stations, dog friendly. Wonderful provincial park! Been coming here for years. Large private campsites, nice beaches, trails, beautiful scenery. Would defiantly recommend checking it out Lovely park, well worth a visit. There are lots of trails to follow and lots of beautiful scenery . We love Arrowhead - its nicely laid out, great sites, and easy to get to. We stayed at Roe campground in site 400 - super private but an easy walk to the vault toilets (which were actually flushable and had a sink - a nice surprise). My ... Ice trail was really great! This park is well organised. There are several beaches. Tons of campsites and quite a few hikes. In the winter there are several cross country ski trails. There is also a really cool ice skating loop. Stubb's falls trail has a really nice (but popular) waterfall. The big bend lookout is worth the 5 minutes of your time! Beautiful Beaches and hiking trails. Only complaint is some of the sites are not very private. Otherwise it is a great park to visit. Great experience. Camping here was fun. Very clean campsites. Torch lit skate was amazing. Ice conditions were perfect. Snowshoeing and cross country skiing is great when whether permits. Very affordable. Would recommend for a fun affordable family outing. Cabins are expensive and book up very ... Very private campsites. Absolutely the best provincial park around that hasn't butchered their park into a camping parking lot. They have maintained a rustic feel. East River campsites are the best - you literally cannot see your closest ... Stayed here a few times and just love it❤ Very nice. Wish there was more showers and on site canoe rentals.

Otherwise beautiful park. I love the way it's full of bushes and trees . 
Clean washrooms and nice walking trails. As beautiful and scenic as this place may be there is an equally good chance that you will return home stricken with mosquito bites unless u have dabbed yourself with sufficient insect repellent cream all over. ALL OVER!!! Great family time and experience It's 6 degrees
 Can't ski, can't skate, can snowshoe. But managed to hike 6 km Very large park that is well kept. The skating loop through the trees is beautiful but we had gone when the weather was starting to warm up so the ice was pretty bad and I decided to walk after doing one lap. There is a trail close to the ice loop that leads to a small waterfall that is really nice. Great provincial park for families. Large sandy beaches, peaceful canoeing down the river to get to stubbes falls. Go here every year and every year I have a blast there is so much to do here. It truly is one of the best provincial parks in all of Canada you will never be bored here. One of my favorite places to camp, sites are(for the most part) fair sized and private...the beaches are awesome and usually relatively quiet. The trails here are amazing with many picturesque views along the way as well as a few ... Top 3 favourite campground of all time! Highly recommend sites in the Roe area. Fantastic spot. Campsites are not on top of each other. Many activities available The park’s leniency with excessive noise at night is very unacceptable. Out of all the parks that I have been to, that was the first time that I witnessed a park staff who just basically drove by and didn’t do anything to control the ... It's a good park but could do with some fixes for the disabled as the disabled bathroom and disabled shower do not have any signs on state that it is a disabled wash my shower and the paths to some of the beaches should be fixed as they are not very accessible for people that are disabled but other than that its a good park Arrowhead is a great place to spend a few days with the family and my two dogs. Be sure to check out the Big Lookout, Stubbs Falls and the brand new visitors center. A beautiful park, with great trails, a gorgeous amber lake, a waterfall, and lots of great trees. Nice hiking trails and the beach were clean. Love this park for camping! Love this park.  Kids love the lake.  Campsites have a good amount of privacy. Campsites here are more secluded than some of the other provincial parks. The park is very run down (lots of dead trees standing and bush over growth...and therefore bugs). My reason for giving 1 star is that while we where on our campsite a 30 foot tree fell on our site and knocked down and broke a fire pit ... Great fun in the winter! Friendly helpful staff, great facilities Love it here my fave place...wish all bathrooms would be updated with sinks. Staff are awesome Amazing and breathtaking! Can cant to head back again next year! 

P.s these pictures dont do justice! Beautiful campground. We stayed in campsite 147, a big site in the South Lumby area that was free of mud and quite flat. Very short walk to one of the beaches on the lake, which is perfect if you have young kids or dogs or both as we do. ... Have been to many provincial parks in Ontario, this is one of the best! Very close to ON 11, wonderful park. Easy hikes with option of parking close to attractions if one doesnt want to hike. 
Washrooms at regular intervals, clean flush ... Beautiful park, full rv sites, quiet tenting sites. Mountain bike trails,winter skating and cross country trails One of the best parks in Ontario for access to an awesome river, nice sandy beaches and Huntsville is 10 min away if the weather is not favorable. Amazing place. In fall especially, with all the amazing fall colors. Really recommend this place! Great park. Close to town in case you forgot something or you need to shop. Have been to this park almost every year since 1996. We have checked out many parks in Ontario and Arrowhead is by far our favourite vacation spot. The new cabins are geat! Well priced and has everything you need. It's lazy camping at ... Lovely to hike and bike. Lots of trail options. Great dog beach, beautiful camp sites with enough space for privacy, multiple beaches for swimming, great hikes and biking trails for people who like a challenge. Fun, but busy. Our favourite campground! Feels in the middle of nowhere with amenities nearby in case of emergency or convenience! The cabins here are the absolute best. It's like testing out a tiny home. It has everything we needed - even a screened in porch for reading at night, and a BBQ for cooking food, a kettle for making hot drinks, and a mini fridge to keep our food cold. Glamping at its best. Awesome spot for hiking and snow shoeing! Don’t miss the frozen waterfall, it’s a must see! It's was very crowded on the Shore like elbow to Elbow but once you got on to the lake it was very peaceful. The fishing was ok. Beautiful park. Very family friendly, great beaches Wonderful place to visit. I would like to go there for camping again and again. Huge park with nice camping sites, trails, lakes and river bends. It's comfortable with clean washrooms and showers. It's very good to take rest with family or/friends. Arrowhead Lake is quiet and good for kayaking, canoe or stand-up paddleboarding! I am going to vizit it again and again!!! Great camping close to home Easy drive from Toronto, kids friendly, lots of things to do, nice small beachs, nice waterfall hike and Big band lookout, must visit. Camping experience. We rented a log cabin. Easy use for parents with young children. Nearby town is also nice to visit. This is a beautiful park to visit in the winters. The skating trail is a great experience to skate among the woods. Fairly flat and easy to do for all levels. We  did not see much food or drink options to make sure to pack some. We stayed at Lumby, site 141. We really liked our site, good privacy, nice scenery, very close to the outhouses. A few minute walk to the beach (really nice beach areas), 10 min walk to the comfort station. We visited the ampitheatre for ... We came to spend the day at the beach and bbq. There were picnic shelters but no where to dispose of the garbage . 
Water was clean and overall we had fun. beautiful park, staff was super friendly and helpful...only downfall was being eaten alive by the mosquitoes and deer flies which is completely normal at the time of year.  I would love to go back for the day when the leaves are changing colour A great park to explore for the day! Terribale experience, during the day all you hear is the highway, during the night all you hear is the highway and honking and a really loud non stop trains. I was suppose to stay Monday to Thursday but I left Wednesday. I drove 2 hours ... I got a cabin and it was awesome! Will definitely get it again! Excellent park for biking and hiking. Clean bathrooms. Bit disappointed no kids program this year during the week. Very private, and very public. Bring tents or a trailer tho. If you hammock camp like I do you will find your limited on the sites where you can place a hammock Perfect spot for friends and family. Proximity to Huntsville is a huge advantage. Worth visiting if you are in the GTA. Highly recommend visiting in the winter for ice skating! Great size lots with lots of privacy and shade. Lots of trails for biking and hiking. Beautiful lake with small but clean beaches. However there were alot of dogs so we did here alot of barking during the day. We also did not appreciate ... Nice beach, Lumby campground is buggy especially after any rainfall. Lovely park but the trails are not well signposted. Second time I've visited arrowhead provincial park and it's absolutely magical. This year we went and the skating wasn't open yet but that didn't matter to us! Snowshoeing was just as Fun, so many laughs as you're trying to walk in the ... This is a very nice park and well worth visiting. I think their reservation fee for camping that is in addition to the camping fee itself is greedy and ridiculous. Take a cc for guarantee people. The park is beautiful in the summer, and last week I came out for the skating trail and it did not disappoint! The rental skates were really nice, park staff were friendly and for the rainy weather they had gotten the past few days, the ... Great campsites and trails Beaches and the water quality are A++
Maintenance and the campsites are A++
My concern is about showers!
1- only 5 for a big group of campsite (all campgrounds are the same)
2- very high pressure and tooooo- long time of shower.
3- ... Modest camping with excellent trails, I highly recommend bringing/renting bikes for their trails Park was closed and my daughter and I just went in for a hike beautiful place. Quiet peaceful beautiful sceneries and easily navigated trails Fire and Ice and tubing are not to be missed Amazing park! Beautiful. Fantastic swimming area! Park was nice and the hiking trails were well maintained, however the staff was not very friendly or welcoming. Huntsville is nice but the park the sites are really close together. The washrooms were not maintained either Loads of things to do whenever your there! Great park for a getaway from the city, lots of activities to do there and lots of places where you can stay nearby the park Really nice park with a great swimming spot for kids. Great park .  We stayed one night. Little loud after 10pm in the no radio section but it was a holiday weekend. Great place to go cross country skiing! The skating track is really fun too, but it gets old after an hour or so. If you're going on a weekend, get there early because the park fills up quickly. Our second time renting the cabins and we loved it.  The staff is not very helpful tho and the washrooms are not well maintained near our cabin. Wonderful campground and close enough to Huntsville for dinner or shopping Clean showers and friendly stuff. Theres nowhere to buy food so make sure you bring enough Amazing experience.  Great facilities!  I hope all visitors will help keep it that way for years and years to come.  We only got to use the skating trail, but our family was out all there all day. Skate trail is awesome. Beautiful view. Seemed flatter this year. Disappointed tubing was closed due to maintenance. But definitely good family fun. Loved this park, large private site, lots of trails. I very much enjoyed my visit. Very disappointed. The park was poorly maintained and the trails full of trash. Ended up in Algonquin where it was so much better. Big private sites. Great trails. Friendly helpful staff. Really nice spot. Had a great time here kayaking . Nice size sites very private. Swim, fish ,and canoe Very nice and safe camping site... We had visited the park before, but, like so many other Ontario parks, their ""strict enforcement"" of leash and other dog policies or the use of generators are at best a joke. 
While the park is beautiful, and the staff friendly, ignorant campers ruin it for those who came to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. Nice park dogs enjoyed the beach. Have only gone on a hike at Arrowhead its nice but trail is so close to the campsites that all you can hear. Lots of trails though the one we wanted to hike was closed but not posted on line. We’ve gone back here for many years now.  Great cross-country trails, with excellent trail grooming!  Ice skating trail is still fairly original as well. Went in the beginning of December. There was some decent snow, enough for snowshoeing fun but most other activities were closed. The heated showers and washrooms on- site were perfect retreats after completing the activities. I would ... Rented a cabin for the Canada day weekend.  Had a great time hiking, swimming and exploring the park.  It was a busy weekend but we'll definitely be back. Just stayed overnight, and would like to return for a longer stay. Hiking trails and lake look appealing! 2 rivers, 2 lakes, large private sites.  very quiet and beautiful. Went camping was very fun and nice campsite definitely suggest you go here Ice skating proved to be smoother than thought, only half of the ski trails were track set which was disappointing. Also there must be a lot of snow for them to open up the tubing so it is unlikely you will get to experience it. If you ... Fabulous place in the winter. Great ice skating trail in the forest! They seemed to have good snowshoeing and cross-country ski trails. No snack bar tho so bring food and a thermos. Great place. However, this experience was not a good one! We arrived a little late, and after renting skates, the guy immediately said ""you have 10 minutes to skate"". Why let people pay full rental and then tell them they've got a few minutes to use them? That's classless! And we weren't able to get our money back either. Still the best place to swim and relax Snow shoeing and skating was a blast. Love this place, well maintained, great trails, nice lake for canoeing and fishing. Must go see Stubbs falls while there. The park closes soon as compared to being a part of the major tourist spot in Ontario Great spot for camping. Good hiking trails and good terrain for biking as well. The falls are definitely worth the time. The lake is nice too, though it is on the small side. Great park with lots of trails and interesting things to see! We spent the week-end there,had a great camp site.Loved the showers,nice and clean.And a good sandy beach,would recommend visiting Stubbs Falls.Mosquitos were the only annoying thing. Beautiful lake, clean sites and washrooms. Beware poison ivy Stayed in a camp cabin close to a nice clean comfort station.  Good privacy and quiet location.  Some wildlife sightings (hare, deer) Great park...very few like it Great campground. Lots of trails for walking, hiking and biking. Canoe rentals. Great speckled trout stocked lake, great eating if you catch them. Beaches are nice as well. Cabins to rent also. Perfect size, it has a number of trails and waterfalls and well as a look out point. We stayed here is July with our 3 year old with a tent trailer and absolutely loved it. We were in site 478 and it was a great site. VERY large and super clean. Lots of fun things to do at the park and in town. Beaches are great and clean.  Enjoyed our day spent at Arrow Park. It's worth the visit. I think I'll go check it out in the summer time. Great place for photography Everything was just perfect. Amazing beach, clean showers, clean washrooms, friendly staff, BUT mosquitos are pains in the neck. If you are going to spend a couple of nights in Arrowhead, make sure you are well equipped to fight ... Superb park.

Camped here with a few friends. It's a beautiful park with a few short hiking trails, nice sandy beach, and canoe/kayak/paddleboat/etc rentals at a reasonable price.

Some are super private and some even have sand! Bathrooms were clean and lots to do around there. It's a big park. Water was nice but there wete way too many people people for the size of the beach and it wasn't even a long weekend. I would come back again. Had a great time with our family in early August! Bugs weren't too bad & the beach + walking paths made for some great adventures Wonderful spot to camp. Easy access to washroom and hydro on site. A shop to buy wood and ice on site as well. Nice hiking trails. Been going here with my family for years. There is no better provincial park in Ontario as far as I’m concerned. This place really is paradise. The staff are always awesome. Balsam Lake was amazing! The sites are really large and it offers a wide variety of private sites with lots of trees or more open/social sites.

The staff were extremely helpful and efficient.

Park rangers were absolutely terrible on my last 2 stays here a few years back. Basically our family was constantly harassed. Literally we are sitting around a campfire talking and ... It was okay, but if you're looking for quiet, this is not your place. We were surrounded by one group of people who had booked at least 5 sites close together. They were constantly walking back and forth between sites, had a super yappy ... Love this Park and would recommend it.. It has a beach, fishing, hiking, fellow campers are friendly and it pet friendly Great campsites, boat rentals, beach areas, and trails but could use a larger dog-friendly area at the beach that is fenced in so the dogs can play. Nice place. A lot of poison ivy though This is an ok place to camp if you don’t want to drive too far for a weekend getaway. But due to my last experience a little over a year ago I will not be returning to camp. For day use, maybe. We were greeted by a very unpleasant park ... A very nice little lake. The beach is not too crowded. There is a lookup trail for the hikers. Great campground. I'd never heard of it before but the beach needs to be better known. Took the dog to the dog beach and he had a blast! Great site. Awesome lake to swim in. And friendly and helpful staff. Couldn't ask for more. Love day here tripping.

Great lake Great park for boating and fishing .clean washrooms just the showers are very hot. The only downside was the rude loud neighbors and the car alarm that went off 3 times that all took turns waking the entire camp ground throughout the night. Everything else was perfect Beautiful Lake, very clean park. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Great hiking trails and lots of wildlife to be spotted. Nice park but I don't need to see it again. Ok, can't judge a park by a one-off experience but our 4 day weekend here was one of the worst. Our family of 4 (2 young kids) had a site beside a band of party goers. Several sites around the area joined them to party which created a ... Great place but the washroom situation is gross.

1. Good trails for hiking.
2. Clean waters for a swim

They came onto the site and showed us where we should set up our trailer. So I confirmed again that we ... Amazing provincial park. Camped here for 3 night and had a really good time. Canoe and kayaks rentals are I'm short supply though so book those ahead of time. Very clean and friendly campground and I would definitely return.  Loved it here, very clean beach and water. Sites fairly open, some folks like this.  We don't really, but it was just fine in September as the park wasn't crowded. Park is well kept, good boating, trails for hiking and biking through the park. Nice place to relax  and have fun with the family Great fishing...good lake. There was a fire ban at the time but other than that no issues. The park and the camping facility is quite clean. Lake, campgrounds and nature are nice. Beach area is poorly maintained. Pavement is falling apart, No modern washrooms. You can smell existing  old fashion washroom from 30 yards. No change rooms. Limited number of rental canoes. People ... Best experience I have ever had! Suggest going there if u r an outdoor person 😍 Came for two nights. Leaving after one cause of the noise from party till after 12 midnight Amazing park with clean lake and trails Great place to camp for the family so loved it Great camp sites and staff A nice place to camp only a couple of hours NE of Toronto and just east of Orillia. Clean lakewater at the accessible beach with a nice playground for kids. Some of the campgrounds are quite open so choose wisely. Second year spent here fore a week. Love the trails, the beach, & the camp lot. Neighbors vary, but swimming at night in warm water looking at the constellations more than makes up for it! This is our favourite park to go during summer. The beach is always wonderful. I only wish that the washrooms got an upgrade here.  This is my favourite camp ground! Love the clear water and sandy beach, a dog beach was added this year too! Its never loud like other camp grounds can be, a lot of families and seniors. Good beach good fishing. Boat launch and dock are well maintained. Could use better bathrooms. One of my favourite provincial parks.  We prefer the Eco-sites (no driving in!) as they're a bit more spread-out and you get more of that wilderness feel.  Amazing sandy beach with great swimming. One of my favourite spots. I have a lot of family history there While 3/4 of the RV camping facilities resemble a trailer park there are a fair number of remarkable sites down by the lake which are complete with private access to the Lake. The Trailer park area seems to be a wonderful place for kids ... Awesome place... We had a fire ban but it didn't stop us. It rained a bit but that's just part of camping and the site was clean and the water was great... Only downside was that too many people were renting boats and they were lots of waiting time to get the next boat.. Recommend to get to the rental shop early... Great time, nice beach and trails The beach here is a lot of fun! Nice big camp ground. Great family spot Pretty good place to camp, the staff could be friendlier. There are a couple nice members but the park Rangers need to get off their power trips Not too far from the city but it seems like the city is forever away when you get here. Love the activities the staff put on and the environment is great. Plenty of beach and you can still find shade as well. And if the beach is packed, there are picnic shelters not too far away. Beautiful place to go.. Lake is no so deep at beach and smooth for non swimmers. Washrooms needs to be upgraded, so many shelters The park has nice facilities and the beach is very nice, the only issue I have is the one park rule .. 6 people max for most sites, I had 5 adults and 4 year old and a 1 year old, well guess what they count babies as a person and I was ... Very nice park, my husband and I went in for the day to go kayaking. Used the boat launch and docks, nice to have 2 launches as it was very busy.  Nice sites.  Washrooms maintained providing staffing is assigned accordingly.  Great trails, nice beach with lots to kid friendly activities. Fisbing5, paddle board/boats for rent. Docking area. Not a far drive from the GTA. Camped on a long weekend and site was a descent size. Initially park employees at the front desk and rental shop were helpful. Life jackets and paddles were stolen from a canoe and we were charged an obscene amount (350) on top of the ... Perfect family Campground and park. Love the beach and picnic area The campsite was OK hard to get into with a very narrow opening (they need to make the openings bigger) The washrooms were nasty, out of our 7 day stay, not sure how many times they were cleaned or they didn't clean it properly since ... Small park but still very pretty. Beach is fun for the kids and it has some hikes. Plenty of parking and camp sites. Lots of beaches and a great boat launch. Just like any provincial park there is a small fee to enter for the day or to camp over night. Highly recommend you reserve a spot early in the spring if your looking to camp in the summer. This is a beautiful park with excellent options of things to do inside the park. One of the best parks close to GTA. Great public beach. Love it. Beautiful place to stay. Like the lake and camping site. Friendly staff. So many picnic benches. Definitely going back next year.  Needs roads repaved and campsites need better drainage.   Most beaches are too rocky and they're not making use of their amphitheatre.  Great and clean park. The beach is a bit of a walk from the camp sites but the beach is beautiful Very nice park. Very spread out though. Lots of walking to get around  Really calm camping and cottage area really good place I visit here every once or twice a year. Fairly quiet with big sites (Cedar Grove).

All of the surrounding towns have great restaurants, golf courses, pubs, tackle and ... Very nice! Awesome beach Nice calm place for camping 
Clean and organized 
Fishing from shore is limited you would need a boat . Great beach, lots of trails to explore safely. Great for families. Very good camp sites, on weekends the beach is very crowded, the beach is mostly pet leashed area except for a small part at the end. Decent not too far from city yet a quiet spot If you're taking a family camping do not take them here, this is a party spot. The noise and the screaming goes on all night! However if you're a partier and you want to hoot and holler all night long this is the perfect spot for you. Don't fear the Rangers or Wardens because they never come around. So busy!! Packed. A bit too busy on beach for my liking. Bathrooms we're nasty at the beach front.  We loved our sites at Balsam Lake but unfortunately on our last day (yesterday) we were given a paddle boat with no instructions on how to check if it was working and in the end got stranded in the lake and had to be rescued first by our ... Good for a day at the beach Awesome time Park is busy. Complained to the warden about a loud partying neighbour at 12:30am but no one ever showed up to address the issue.

Albion hills so much better Warm waters, waves, boat rentals, treats. What more could ya ask for?  nice place Nice beach Nice place Great experience Very nice. Was a packed weekend, but other than a little music one night, I really didn't feel crowded.  Crowded but best in natural resources, clean and basic on site facilities Love the beach. Very private eco-sites, great lake for canoeing, and plenty of wildlife to be seen Perfect location for camping and canoeing. 
Facilities need some repairs.  GGG Nice place but way to easy to get lost in here WOW I like it and cool place Great full feature provincial park for family car camping trips  Nice and clean. Really peaceful and quiet Great place to camp and the lake is calm for canoing and kayaking! It's a quiet campground and family friendly There is alot of fun A nice park for camping and beach fun. The park itself is great, however there are way too many amateur campers (since it's really close to Toronto). They shower for 40 minutes and are generally not fun to be around and somewhat prissy. So if you are planning on a secluded ... Some sites lack privacy. Great beach The lake is beautiful Fun time with my family here...site 512 was awesome Good staff Regular family camping trip. Good boating swimming and just a great get away There was no grass where they put us just hard dirt not great for a tent the place was more for trailers it was more a trailer park than a government park and expensive and washroom was a nasty outhouse it was discussing really really bad Overcrowded. Poor privacy. A great place to camp and swim. Nice beach. Option to rent peddle boat.  Nice place Fresh clean fun camping Great park on a great lake! Great park and camping with lots of stuff to do for kids and a very nice beach. Clean bathrooms that are regularly maintained. That only thing I found that bothered me were the showers. You have keep pushing the button over and over again for weak water presure and lukewarm temps. No 5 stars because of this sorry.  Went last minute camping. Close to GTA is a plus, but the park itself is small and can get crowded. The electric sites are too close to each other. Loved it. Great beach Great place to go camping. Friendly and helpful staff. Great campsite by the lake with many lots to choose from. Great beach, clean water, friendly helpful staff, clean and well maintained. Awesome staff help. Amazing boat launch. Nice camping location, though it can be busy. Went camping as a group loved it.Amazing park  Very nice park with good boat ramp. The lake/water is nice, 2 hrs away from toronto which is not bad. But for me the downside is the washroom and no life guard. I don't know if im going back there again.  Excellent provincial park with a great beach Very Good Place For Family Picnic Great Park! Clean,  good beach warm water.  Best provincial park in Ontario!! The only downer to this place is you cant rent a motor boat to go fishing.

There are covered picnic areas that can be used. One can also book the whole picnic shed if there is a large group. There is also a volleyball net with sand underneath the feet. Space is also available for camping if one wants to camp overnight. Favourite provincial park to camp in so far. The beach surprised us, actually a sandy beach! Lake water was warm once you got in and you could go probably 50 meters before the sand turned to seaweed. 

At the campsites we chose power ...

Simply the best beach I have been into this year. The wqter is very warm and it's not overly crowded. Great lake for Swimming in warm water though always wear a life jacket even though I am a marathon swimmer...great for tent camping, excellent staff. Beautiful nice beach with clean water. Bonus shady areas with picnic tables right by the water. Nice country beautiful park nice clean park water traffic heavy fri sundays.

Great lake Great park for boating and fishing .clean washrooms just the showers are very hot. The only downside was the rude loud neighbors and the car alarm that went off 3 times that all took turns waking the entire camp ground throughout the night. Everything else was perfect Beautiful Lake, very clean park. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Great hiking trails and lots of wildlife to be spotted. Nice park but I don't need to see it again. Ok, can't judge a park by a one-off experience but our 4 day weekend here was one of the worst. Our family of 4 (2 young kids) had a site beside a band of party goers. Several sites around the area joined them to party which created a ... Great place but the washroom situation is gross. It's a porta potty with concrete walls. love this place.  good access to lake and lots of good wildlife.  the staff keep it very clean and are super friendly.  If only they had a winter program.

Clean, quiet and love the beach. Enjoyable camp site, nice and close to lots of things for the kids to do. The water is so clear and the place is so beautiful. Overall, very good. However, it gets repetitive after 3 or 4 times. Great for a one time visit during the summer, bot if you're looking for a cottage, move on. This provincial park is beautiful. Lake is large and dark, but clear water. The sites are big an very private in the area we stayed. Site 506 was a dream. Access directly to the lake and we were able to launch our canoe directly from the ... Nice lake.  Great camping Did a day trip here on the July long weekend. 

The day-use area bathrooms are terrible. Someone could get sick here. Non-flush toilets... disgusting! Day-trippers PAY to use the park too!! Had to use the campers toilets which is allowed ... Excellent campsite and very nice beach. We picked our campsite (#484) for it's privacy, and we really enjoyed it. Although the site was walk-in, it was only about 100m from the parking lot, so we were able to just walk back and forth to ... Its a beautiful place, the water is amazing and so is the canoeing, although the park rangers are hit or miss, some are nice and some will yell at you for any little thing. Fun times. Nice beach. Very clean and nice Pros:
1. Good trails for hiking.
2. Clean waters for a swim
3. You can camp there (but I haven't experienced it personally so can't comment on that)
4. Canoes and kayaks are available for rent at reasonable prices.
Cons:
Lots of bugs at the trails so carry a bug spray for sure. Very wooded and great privacy. Big beautiful lake and park The beaches were nice and not over crowded.  Site 51 didn't have much privacy but that was expected.  This facilitied were generally clean but the showers were super hot.  Park staff were friendly and helpful.  It rained hard for 30 ... Always love visiting Balsam!! When pulling up to our site we were confused on what site was ours so we called over 2 staff members to confirm what site was ours. They came onto the site and showed us where we should set up our trailer. So I confirmed again that we ... Amazing provincial park. Camped here for 3 night and had a really good time. Canoe and kayaks rentals are I'm short supply though so book those ahead of time. Very clean and friendly campground and I would definitely return.  Loved it here, very clean beach and water. Sites fairly open, some folks like this.  We don't really, but it was just fine in September as the park wasn't crowded. Park is well kept, good boating, trails for hiking and biking through the park. Nice place to relax  and have fun with the family Great fishing...good lake. There was a fire ban at the time but other than that no issues. The park and the camping facility is quite clean. Lake, campgrounds and nature are nice. Beach area is poorly maintained. Pavement is falling apart, No modern washrooms. You can smell existing  old fashion washroom from 30 yards. No change rooms. Limited number of rental canoes. People ... Best experience I have ever had! Suggest going there if u r an outdoor person 😍 Came for two nights. Leaving after one cause of the noise from party till after 12 midnight Amazing park with clean lake and trails Great place to camp for the family so loved it Great camp sites and staff A nice place to camp only a couple of hours NE of Toronto and just east of Orillia. Clean lakewater at the accessible beach with a nice playground for kids. Some of the campgrounds are quite open so choose wisely. Second year spent here fore a week. Love the trails, the beach, & the camp lot. Neighbors vary, but swimming at night in warm water looking at the constellations more than makes up for it! This is our favourite park to go during summer. The beach is always wonderful. I only wish that the washrooms got an upgrade here.  This is my favourite camp ground! Love the clear water and sandy beach, a dog beach was added this year too! Its never loud like other camp grounds can be, a lot of families and seniors. Good beach good fishing. Boat launch and dock are well maintained. Could use better bathrooms. One of my favourite provincial parks.  We prefer the Eco-sites (no driving in!) as they're a bit more spread-out and you get more of that wilderness feel.  Amazing sandy beach with great swimming. One of my favourite spots. I have a lot of family history there While 3/4 of the RV camping facilities resemble a trailer park there are a fair number of remarkable sites down by the lake which are complete with private access to the Lake. The Trailer park area seems to be a wonderful place for kids ... Awesome place... We had a fire ban but it didn't stop us. It rained a bit but that's just part of camping and the site was clean and the water was great... Only downside was that too many people were renting boats and they were lots of waiting time to get the next boat.. Recommend to get to the rental shop early... Great time, nice beach and trails The beach here is a lot of fun! Nice big camp ground. Great family spot Pretty good place to camp, the staff could be friendlier. There are a couple nice members but the park Rangers need to get off their power trips Not too far from the city but it seems like the city is forever away when you get here. Love the activities the staff put on and the environment is great. Plenty of beach and you can still find shade as well. And if the beach is packed, there are picnic shelters not too far away. Beautiful place to go.. Lake is no so deep at beach and smooth for non swimmers. Washrooms needs to be upgraded, so many shelters The park has nice facilities and the beach is very nice, the only issue I have is the one park rule .. 6 people max for most sites, I had 5 adults and 4 year old and a 1 year old, well guess what they count babies as a person and I was ... Very nice park, my husband and I went in for the day to go kayaking. Used the boat launch and docks, nice to have 2 launches as it was very busy.  Nice sites.  Washrooms maintained providing staffing is assigned accordingly.  Great trails, nice beach with lots to kid friendly activities. Fisbing5, paddle board/boats for rent. Docking area. Not a far drive from the GTA. Camped on a long weekend and site was a descent size. Initially park employees at the front desk and rental shop were helpful. Life jackets and paddles were stolen from a canoe and we were charged an obscene amount (350) on top of the ... Perfect family Campground and park. Love the beach and picnic area The campsite was OK hard to get into with a very narrow opening (they need to make the openings bigger) The washrooms were nasty, out of our 7 day stay, not sure how many times they were cleaned or they didn't clean it properly since ... Small park but still very pretty. Beach is fun for the kids and it has some hikes. Plenty of parking and camp sites. Lots of beaches and a great boat launch. Just like any provincial park there is a small fee to enter for the day or to camp over night. Highly recommend you reserve a spot early in the spring if your looking to camp in the summer. This is a beautiful park with excellent options of things to do inside the park. One of the best parks close to GTA. Great public beach. Love it. Beautiful place to stay. Like the lake and camping site. Friendly staff. So many picnic benches. Definitely going back next year.  Needs roads repaved and campsites need better drainage.   Most beaches are too rocky and they're not making use of their amphitheatre.  Great and clean park. The beach is a bit of a walk from the camp sites but the beach is beautiful Very nice park. Very spread out though. Lots of walking to get around  Really calm camping and cottage area really good place I visit here every once or twice a year. Fairly quiet with big sites (Cedar Grove). Nice and close to home too Visited in September when the park wasn't too busy. Nice clean washrooms. Wonderful open play area and beach. Love it ! We come every year with are family Great place to camp for a weekend. June is bad for bugs but if you're prepared you will be good Great place to camp! A great Provincial Park for many different aspects. If your into fishing, camping, outdoor activities or family oriented activities all are available. All of the surrounding towns have great restaurants, golf courses, pubs, tackle and ... Very nice! Awesome beach Nice calm place for camping 
Clean and organized 
Fishing from shore is limited you would need a boat . Great beach, lots of trails to explore safely. Great for families. Very good camp sites, on weekends the beach is very crowded, the beach is mostly pet leashed area except for a small part at the end. Decent not too far from city yet a quiet spot If you're taking a family camping do not take them here, this is a party spot. The noise and the screaming goes on all night! However if you're a partier and you want to hoot and holler all night long this is the perfect spot for you. Don't fear the Rangers or Wardens because they never come around. So busy!! Packed. A bit too busy on beach for my liking. Bathrooms we're nasty at the beach front.  We loved our sites at Balsam Lake but unfortunately on our last day (yesterday) we were given a paddle boat with no instructions on how to check if it was working and in the end got stranded in the lake and had to be rescued first by our ... Good for a day at the beach Awesome time Park is busy. Complained to the warden about a loud partying neighbour at 12:30am but no one ever showed up to address the issue.  If you want to experience trying to sleep next to a group speaking in full volume well into the night, here's a gem. It was amazing,great beach for amazing familly fun there is a lot of trails that are unique and awesome plus the washrooms Hot water! and Clean Showers regular maintained! the staff love them they are so nice to everyone Love it great place lots to do swim bike chillax Picturesque park with BBQ area and camp groinds, clean water, beautiful lake, sandy beach, dogs and children friendly  We are avid Provincial Park campers.  This trip we were pre fishing for a tourney, so we brought our tent instead of our trailer.  The park & launch are great & well kept.  The staff were are great, especially Anne, a woman who I ... disgusting washrooms and it's a paid park 2 hour drive 

Albion hills so much better Warm waters, waves, boat rentals, treats. What more could ya ask for?  nice place Nice beach Nice place Great experience Very nice. Was a packed weekend, but other than a little music one night, I really didn't feel crowded.  Crowded but best in natural resources, clean and basic on site facilities Love the beach. Very private eco-sites, great lake for canoeing, and plenty of wildlife to be seen Perfect location for camping and canoeing. 
Facilities need some repairs.  GGG Nice place but way to easy to get lost in here WOW I like it and cool place Great full feature provincial park for family car camping trips  Nice and clean. Really peaceful and quiet Great place to camp and the lake is calm for canoing and kayaking! It's a quiet campground and family friendly There is alot of fun A nice park for camping and beach fun. The park itself is great, however there are way too many amateur campers (since it's really close to Toronto). They shower for 40 minutes and are generally not fun to be around and somewhat prissy. So if you are planning on a secluded ... Some sites lack privacy. Great beach The lake is beautiful Fun time with my family here...site 512 was awesome Good staff Regular family camping trip. Good boating swimming and just a great get away There was no grass where they put us just hard dirt not great for a tent the place was more for trailers it was more a trailer park than a government park and expensive and washroom was a nasty outhouse it was discussing really really bad Overcrowded. Poor privacy. A great place to camp and swim. Nice beach. Option to rent peddle boat.  Nice place Fresh clean fun camping Great park on a great lake! Great park and camping with lots of stuff to do for kids and a very nice beach. Clean bathrooms that are regularly maintained. That only thing I found that bothered me were the showers. You have keep pushing the button over and over again for weak water presure and lukewarm temps. No 5 stars because of this sorry.  Went last minute camping. Close to GTA is a plus, but the park itself is small and can get crowded. The electric sites are too close to each other. Loved it. Great beach Great place to go camping. Friendly and helpful staff. Great campsite by the lake with many lots to choose from. Great beach, clean water, friendly helpful staff, clean and well maintained. Awesome staff help. Amazing boat launch. Nice camping location, though it can be busy. Went camping as a group loved it.Amazing park  Very nice park with good boat ramp. The lake/water is nice, 2 hrs away from toronto which is not bad. But for me the downside is the washroom and no life guard. I don't know if im going back there again.  Excellent provincial park with a great beach Very Good Place For Family Picnic Great Park! Clean,  good beach warm water.  Best provincial park in Ontario!! The only downer to this place is you cant rent a motor boat to go fishing. Loved it The trails are exciting and invigorating....nature lovers delight. Never a dull moment. Great park with good sites and a great beach.  Hi Folks,

Quiet peaceful and lots of mosquitos😊 Yep Like any and all Ontario Provincial Park, this one was well layed out.  As for Balsam Lake, it looked like a nice lake to bring a watercraft on. Amazing lake, clean campsites, awesome trails! Wonderful for families....kids and pets Lots  of camping site,nice lake. Love the beach!!! Guess if I was 17 and was looking forward to my first beer, this would be the place to go.   But a weekend in Balsam Lake and apparently all my views are those of an old, crotchety man.

Beach was super, location is decent, but for those ... Great camping Everytime! Clean, beautiful and we'll spaced Disappointed, nothing much to see.

This place definitely warrants a visit during the early and mid fall time frame. The foliage and colors hugging along the shoreline of the lake is really worth the trip. ... It's a campground.

The park store was amazingly reasonably priced.
Free borrowing of fishing gear...no deposit.
Bathrooms are well kept. 
Friendly crowd. Can't wait to go back. 
Ten minutes away from Orillia For starters I was put in a crowded place. No privacy . The beach was too far. And once we finally got there it was way too over crowded. The washrooms were desgusting. And the half decent ones were all the way on the other side of the campground Great campground. Excellent Beach, nice sites with lots of shade (hilltop campground). Some traffic noise and headlights from road directly behind our site. Wardens and office staff all very friendly.  Beach is shallow (maybe 3 feet at ... absolutely loved it, been going there (amount other places) to camp for many years.

Lovely place, the lake view is so beautiful good place for camping and hanging out with friends and family The park is beautiful and the bathrooms cleaned every 4 hours.

It is very quiet from about September onwards so nice if there is ... I go here every year and only go somewhere else to try new places. It's my comfortable default place. No complaints Amazing camping ground. The water fees just right.  Will certain come back. I was there for short time , but the park has great green area , playground , boat renting, the beach is not big but very clean, is a nice family place. Can't go wrong with this camping choice.  Coffee, ice cream and snacks available yet rustic. The park itself is beautiful but do not camp here.

We try to come here at least once a year...love it! Lovely park. Nice walking trails. We had went there August 5, 2018, and were treated very poorly by this beach and we will never return.

Decent swimming spot 
Had a great time great camping with kids, have clean washroom and good entertainment for children The third provincial park I've visited this year and by far this one has the worst maintenance and care of its facilities. Broken fixtures, doors and locks. The staff was very friendly. Maybe too young to have pride in their place of ... My first camping trip and loved the experience. Very nice park. Small though. Good staff and well kept facilities. Lots were nice. Really enjoyed a relaxing weekend! A nice campground close to home.  Good sites and clean amenities.  Nice play area for kids and safe swimming.  Covered picnic areas.  Not a wilderness adventure like Algonquin, but great for families or folks who don't want hours to travel from Torontom Good times. The road got to  slippery and my bike ended up slippinf causing me to fall with no help for 10minutes and now i have a scar on my leg from that so i say to bass Lake pave your roads and not have gravel Clean park.  Camped here and went for day visit separately.  Very clean.  Great beach.  Sites are average.  Sadly no wildlife and safe from bears as the park is surrounded by large fence. Since its a provincial park be prepared to pay $20 for parking! Nice place but not nice security guys :) Want to go back nice lake Excellent recreational park. Not a nature park. Good for weekends trips with friends or children. Nice beach with warm water. Some site's fire pits were outdated. Bring your own grill if you plan to cook on the fire pit.  It was a nice get-away close to the Toronto. Close proximity to Orillia. Nice camp sites-if a tad close to one another. The premises and bathrooms were clean and the firewood dry. The only negative is that overnight their is no one to ... Great place to canoe and fish. Great park and great service! Great park with a great boat lunch Great beach and lots of trails to explore  really nice grounds. Site choice makes a big difference in terms of privacy but the overall place is very nice with some decent trails.  Close to shopping too of you don't line roughing it or forget to bring something. Small but delicate provincial park. Excellent location, close to major cities in GTA. Rental boats are available near the lake. Washroom and shower room are very clean. The only problem is that some campsites are near external traffic Been going here for the past 30 years! Peaceful. Lots of space between sites. Ridiculous to charge 13.00 for extra vehicle on your site. It's paid for why the need for extra charge. Doesn't the government make enough money off of us? A friend came to visit for 1 hr. And received a 30.00 parking ticket.  Meanwhile people from outside were able to park and walk through the park for free. Went paddling. 1 kayak, 1 sup. Bay to the left of the boat launch very nice and calm, but basically everywhere else the waters were suuuper choppy. Wind was estimated at 13kph, so FYI there.

Otherwise good place, water was a nice temp and looked clear and clean Nice beach, great playground. Sites have very little privacy though. Would be great for camping with a group. A great park to camp with small children.  A big beach and picnic area.  A play ground and easy trails.  Also close to town, but far enough that you can't hear the highway.   It was a great camping trip! Very rustic but clean and sheltered. You almost don't notice that you are 10 minutes from town.  Boat ramp area needs more parking or a round-a-bout to help launch boats a bit better. Sites are good size though and have lots of variety to choose from.  great park and clean facilities.  I'll definitely return.  The beach is a little small but the well kept.  very good place relaxed Nice beach,good maintain,friendly staff. We had wonderful camping there. But Camping sites nearby main road a little noisy.  $40 a night for cheapest no power site Excellent place to enjoy with the family Great camp ground not too far north, clean beach, easy boat launch access. Always enjoy spending a weekend up here No fish in this lake. Waste of day pass except to enjoy the view of water. Clean, well maintained sites. Nice swimming area. Clean comfort stations and clean toilets. Good trails and nice scenery.  Great sites, whether you want shade or sun they have it, electrical, non electrical. Great value for sure fees. Park rangers are helpful yet not intrusive Great camp sites, Great beach,  husband didn't fare well in the fishing department though. Very friendly staff and clean washrooms and showers My favourite camping place ,nice shower and clean bathroom! Only 5 mins to city and town !!! Best location for city people  I love this place. It's close enough that the family can camp here and if I need to work I still can drive in.  Small lake, weekend seems busy but eveyone left by Sunday afternoon.  The lake is clean, small beach.  There is one comfort station for the whole park but the lines for the showers were short, even though the park was busy.  The hike ... Nice Sandy lake to swim in. One of the first to warm up in the area as well. Clean,beautiful beach ,friendly staff Beautiful, convenient for families , shelter, and nice people in the office, clean and pleasant lake, not too far from Toronto!  Small park.
Not a good beach. Just reasonable I love this park. We camp here every year for a week. Lots of walking trails. Try not to get a site too close to the road or you hear alot of traffic. The beach is really nice and there is lots of room.
Orillia is very close so there's lots to see.  Water was nice and clean. Drinking water readily available. Lots of trees. Can be crowded. Comfort stations were clean. We'll be back next year! Enjoy beach in Orillia While this Lake is quite lovely,  renters beware of the private cottage rentals in the area.  Always use the registered third party agencies that guarantee your payment process and refunds.  We were scammed more than once in this area.  Renters Beware! A very secnic provincial park well kept and close to the City of Orillia Great park. Awesome warm water Camp sites are well maintained, and the lake is very nice.  Nice place Good camping Beach is very small and sires are close together. A long weekend is not the best time to come here, but it would be nice during non-peak times. Never far from a toilet or water. I went here to go fishing, don't bother going its horrible!  I fished for a long time with worms and only  caught  one 2"" pumkinseed!  And you can only fish at one spot the boat launch!  Very very very small provincial park only 1 small beach and not the most friendliest people.  Nice small provincial park (less than 200 campsites, beautiful sand beach which is groomed daily, shallow water with sand bottom, quite lake, lots of shade near the water.   One of my favourite provincial parks in the area It's a nice park with some decent sized lots however it is a very small park. It's great for a weekend getaway with the family but not to spend any long lengths of time there. It has one hiking trail that is maybe 3 KM long. Not much to ... Loved it! I know there's  Cottages  because  my neighbor has one + It's a great place Bass Lake Prov. Park is a naturally beautiful backdrop for a nature hike and in my case, I love photos in the fall.  This is an amazing place to take your camera! This is my cottage lake! Just love everything about Bass Lake. As for the Park, it is a nice smaller park, quieter than most Provincial Parks. Plus it's very close to Orillia. A great spot for the kids. Excellent provincial park with very private trailer lots in the ""Eastside"" area as well as a very nice beach. Great small park with a nice Sandy beach,  quiet and close enough to town that you can stock up on the half dozen things you forgot to bring camping.  This is our favorite place to camp. It's a very  clean place.  Not a lot of privacy between sites. Loud and excessive noise from party sites. Will not be returning. Beautiful Parking is so expensive. Washrooms are dirty and disgusting. I'm not really into camping, but went there once, seemed like a good place for a family, has facilities nearby campsites. Nice park...decent fishing...a little small, but a friendly place with nice staff and good sized sites...will return again. group site washrooms were okay, and if you take a shortcut through the woods, the showers+nice washrooms are only 20 minutes away
the beach however is very small and it is quite a hassle to walk there Small  but beautiful park the water is clear I love to come again  Great small Park,  clean and nice beach,  highly recommend  Great sites, very quiet.

This place definitely warrants a visit during the early and mid fall time frame. The foliage and colors hugging along the shoreline of the lake is really worth the trip. ... It's a campground. Has what it claims. Though inadequate parking around boat launch area. Washrooms and Showers clean. Not many fish biting. I always come here with my church for our annual beach trip. The park is always well kept and clean. Renting the side houses are always easy to do. The beach is lovely to swim in. And the walking trail is beautiful to take a stroll.

The park store was amazingly reasonably priced.
Free borrowing of fishing gear...no deposit.
Bathrooms are well kept. 
Friendly crowd. Can't wait to go back. 
Ten minutes away from Orillia For starters I was put in a crowded place. No privacy . The beach was too far. And once we finally got there it was way too over crowded. The washrooms were desgusting. And the half decent ones were all the way on the other side of the campground Great campground. Excellent Beach, nice sites with lots of shade (hilltop campground). Some traffic noise and headlights from road directly behind our site. Wardens and office staff all very friendly.  Beach is shallow (maybe 3 feet at ... absolutely loved it, been going there (amount other places) to camp for many years. Lots are huge with lots of privacy, although some of the lots could have the Hydro a bit more accessible to the sites! Nice park with lake to rent canoes.  Very steep hills in park must be in good shape to get around park.  Good location close to city amenities. Bass Lake Provincial Park is a great spot for a family camping trip. Located a short drive from Toronto, it is accessible from anywhere in the GTA. 

The campground has a great beach, which the kids are able to wade out in and enjoy. At ... Basslake was OK, if it's ur first time camping than this would be a great park to visit.

Not a lot of mosquitoes.   Facilities were nice and clean.  Beach was great. Bass Lake Provincial Park is a lovely campsite with friendly park staff. The beach is large and the water is clean, and nearby trails offer fantastic hiking for individuals or families. We went to visit my cousins in Wasago, and Bass lake was one of the campgrounds that was close to there house. We camped at hilltop campground which was close to the water tapes and washrooms/showers. It’s a nice campground, very clean. ... Lovely place, the lake view is so beautiful good place for camping and hanging out with friends and family The park is beautiful and the bathrooms cleaned every 4 hours. The reason the park gets only two stars are because the wardens were patrolling and picking every infraction possible. Most of the time we agreed with them but when we get ...

Camping: decent sites, lots of trees/ cover, well maintained garbage area, and bathrooms are kept nice too! ... Very close to a lot of residential houses and the road so it is not very quiet or picturesque. The beaches are quite odd and obviously not natural, they are very groomed. It is very quiet from about September onwards so nice if there is ... I go here every year and only go somewhere else to try new places. It's my comfortable default place. No complaints Amazing camping ground. The water fees just right.  Will certain come back. I was there for short time , but the park has great green area , playground , boat renting, the beach is not big but very clean, is a nice family place. Can't go wrong with this camping choice.  Coffee, ice cream and snacks available yet rustic. The park itself is beautiful but do not camp here. Taking around a fire is excessive noise yet children screaming at 5/6 in the morning is completely fine. Using twigs directly beside the fire pit for kindling is obstructing property, ... We try to come here at least once a year...love it! Lovely park. Nice walking trails. We had went there August 5, 2018, and were treated very poorly by this beach and we will never return. This place is very racist and we could not even set up any of our things before we were asked to leave by the police & the park ... Went here whilst on vacation.

And park ranger  has a power trip over loading the car for 1 min at a non parking spot If there is no star I will choose it, Terrible staff, very racist, rude and bad Managment, I complained to the superintendent, ministry of natural resources, and I’m escalating... Great Provincial Park. Great camping and fun for the whole family Good fishing but small parking lot for boat trailers Very clean facilities, boat launch is good. Relaxing enough space lots of time 
Decent swimming spot 
Had a great time great camping with kids, have clean washroom and good entertainment for children The third provincial park I've visited this year and by far this one has the worst maintenance and care of its facilities. Broken fixtures, doors and locks. The staff was very friendly. Maybe too young to have pride in their place of ... My first camping trip and loved the experience. Very nice park. Small though. Good staff and well kept facilities. Lots were nice. Really enjoyed a relaxing weekend! A nice campground close to home.  Good sites and clean amenities.  Nice play area for kids and safe swimming.  Covered picnic areas.  Not a wilderness adventure like Algonquin, but great for families or folks who don't want hours to travel from Torontom Good times. The road got to  slippery and my bike ended up slippinf causing me to fall with no help for 10minutes and now i have a scar on my leg from that so i say to bass Lake pave your roads and not have gravel Clean park.  Camped here and went for day visit separately.  Very clean.  Great beach.  Sites are average.  Sadly no wildlife and safe from bears as the park is surrounded by large fence. Since its a provincial park be prepared to pay $20 for parking! Nice place but not nice security guys :) Want to go back nice lake Excellent recreational park. Not a nature park. Good for weekends trips with friends or children. Nice beach with warm water. Some site's fire pits were outdated. Bring your own grill if you plan to cook on the fire pit.  It was a nice get-away close to the Toronto. Close proximity to Orillia. Nice camp sites-if a tad close to one another. The premises and bathrooms were clean and the firewood dry. The only negative is that overnight their is no one to ... Great place to canoe and fish. Great park and great service! Great park with a great boat lunch Great beach and lots of trails to explore  really nice grounds. Site choice makes a big difference in terms of privacy but the overall place is very nice with some decent trails.  Close to shopping too of you don't line roughing it or forget to bring something. Small but delicate provincial park. Excellent location, close to major cities in GTA. Rental boats are available near the lake. Washroom and shower room are very clean. The only problem is that some campsites are near external traffic Been going here for the past 30 years! Peaceful. Lots of space between sites. Ridiculous to charge 13.00 for extra vehicle on your site. It's paid for why the need for extra charge. Doesn't the government make enough money off of us? A friend came to visit for 1 hr. And received a 30.00 parking ticket.  Meanwhile people from outside were able to park and walk through the park for free. Went paddling. 1 kayak, 1 sup. Bay to the left of the boat launch very nice and calm, but basically everywhere else the waters were suuuper choppy. Wind was estimated at 13kph, so FYI there.

Otherwise good place, water was a nice temp and looked clear and clean Nice beach, great playground. Sites have very little privacy though. Would be great for camping with a group. A great park to camp with small children.  A big beach and picnic area.  A play ground and easy trails.  Also close to town, but far enough that you can't hear the highway.   It was a great camping trip! Very rustic but clean and sheltered. You almost don't notice that you are 10 minutes from town.  Boat ramp area needs more parking or a round-a-bout to help launch boats a bit better. Sites are good size though and have lots of variety to choose from.  great park and clean facilities.  I'll definitely return.  The beach is a little small but the well kept.  very good place relaxed Nice beach,good maintain,friendly staff. We had wonderful camping there. But Camping sites nearby main road a little noisy.  $40 a night for cheapest no power site Excellent place to enjoy with the family Great camp ground not too far north, clean beach, easy boat launch access. Always enjoy spending a weekend up here No fish in this lake. Waste of day pass except to enjoy the view of water. Clean, well maintained sites. Nice swimming area. Clean comfort stations and clean toilets. Good trails and nice scenery.  Great sites, whether you want shade or sun they have it, electrical, non electrical. Great value for sure fees. Park rangers are helpful yet not intrusive Great camp sites, Great beach,  husband didn't fare well in the fishing department though. Very friendly staff and clean washrooms and showers My favourite camping place ,nice shower and clean bathroom! Only 5 mins to city and town !!! Best location for city people  I love this place. It's close enough that the family can camp here and if I need to work I still can drive in.  Small lake, weekend seems busy but eveyone left by Sunday afternoon.  The lake is clean, small beach.  There is one comfort station for the whole park but the lines for the showers were short, even though the park was busy.  The hike ... Nice Sandy lake to swim in. One of the first to warm up in the area as well. Clean,beautiful beach ,friendly staff Beautiful, convenient for families , shelter, and nice people in the office, clean and pleasant lake, not too far from Toronto!  Small park.
Not a good beach. Just reasonable I love this park. We camp here every year for a week. Lots of walking trails. Try not to get a site too close to the road or you hear alot of traffic. The beach is really nice and there is lots of room.
Orillia is very close so there's lots to see.  Water was nice and clean. Drinking water readily available. Lots of trees. Can be crowded. Comfort stations were clean. We'll be back next year! Enjoy beach in Orillia While this Lake is quite lovely,  renters beware of the private cottage rentals in the area.  Always use the registered third party agencies that guarantee your payment process and refunds.  We were scammed more than once in this area.  Renters Beware! A very secnic provincial park well kept and close to the City of Orillia Great park. Awesome warm water Camp sites are well maintained, and the lake is very nice.  Nice place Good camping Beach is very small and sires are close together. A long weekend is not the best time to come here, but it would be nice during non-peak times. Never far from a toilet or water. I went here to go fishing, don't bother going its horrible!  I fished for a long time with worms and only  caught  one 2"" pumkinseed!  And you can only fish at one spot the boat launch!  Very very very small provincial park only 1 small beach and not the most friendliest people.  Nice small provincial park (less than 200 campsites, beautiful sand beach which is groomed daily, shallow water with sand bottom, quite lake, lots of shade near the water.   One of my favourite provincial parks in the area It's a nice park with some decent sized lots however it is a very small park. It's great for a weekend getaway with the family but not to spend any long lengths of time there. It has one hiking trail that is maybe 3 KM long. Not much to ... Loved it! I know there's  Cottages  because  my neighbor has one + It's a great place Bass Lake Prov. Park is a naturally beautiful backdrop for a nature hike and in my case, I love photos in the fall.  This is an amazing place to take your camera! This is my cottage lake! Just love everything about Bass Lake. As for the Park, it is a nice smaller park, quieter than most Provincial Parks. Plus it's very close to Orillia. A great spot for the kids. Excellent provincial park with very private trailer lots in the ""Eastside"" area as well as a very nice beach. Great small park with a nice Sandy beach,  quiet and close enough to town that you can stock up on the half dozen things you forgot to bring camping.  This is our favorite place to camp. It's a very  clean place.  Not a lot of privacy between sites. Loud and excessive noise from party sites. Will not be returning. Beautiful Parking is so expensive. Washrooms are dirty and disgusting. I'm not really into camping, but went there once, seemed like a good place for a family, has facilities nearby campsites. Nice park...decent fishing...a little small, but a friendly place with nice staff and good sized sites...will return again. group site washrooms were okay, and if you take a shortcut through the woods, the showers+nice washrooms are only 20 minutes away
the beach however is very small and it is quite a hassle to walk there Small  but beautiful park the water is clear I love to come again  Great small Park,  clean and nice beach,  highly recommend  Great sites, very quiet.

Lovely beach, hiking trails to suit every fitness level including a trail that is wheelchair accessible, great interpretive centre ... Massive campsite with lots of amenities (Hikes, beach, interpretive centre, showers). It was a bit too much of a party campsite (noisy, drunks, etc) and very expensive for my tastes but it was also like a friendly little town during the day.

And no floodlights! Nice place overall. Bring earplugs. Always a beautiful place go. Especially if the weather is good. Lots of trails to explore and the lake is as cold as can be. Have been going for the past 16 years. Small but packed with beautiful campground, forest and hiking trails for its size. Beautiful clear water.. One of our favourite places in the region. Great sites, beautiful & cold, clear lake for swimming. There are many nice hiking trails for every effort level and ripe blueberries growing along one of them! The interpretive center was a quiet building to escape the heat and the lady on staff was very knowledgable about the local flora and fauna. Best provincial park I've ever visited. So many events always on and beautiful beaches. Park staff is fantastic. I recommend anyone going through vermillion to stop by. A good place to take the kids camping. Crystal clear, and cool water lake, with sandy beach. A couple of hiking trail options. Well maintained and kept. One of my favourite places! I went here as a young adult with my bf and it was the best experience I've ever had camping. It's my favorite lake to this day.  We did a part of the loop, starting off in the campgrounds. It was a beautiful sight to see. The scenery, ... This is an excellent family oriented campground. Nice sites and beautiful  bluewater just like the name. 25 years of coming here with so many upgrades What an amazing park. Go in June to have the entire park and beach to yourself. Water is so clear. Beautiful beach, with play equipment for kids. Nicely kept campgrounds with lots of space. And the lake is so crystal clear. Very nice park with lots of things to do. My only recommendation would be to give more beach space to the dogs because it seems every other campsite has 1-2 dogs. Great place to camp or day trip. Have been going here for years. Love the lake and the many things to do. Still the nicest fark for a family vacation. Been coming here for nearly 50 years since 1960s. Love it. Quiet campground. Clear, clean lake. Rugged nature. Beautiful. I just love this place. Giant beach, great camp sites, good programming. Beautiful clean clear Lake, lots of beachline, an area for dogs to swim with their owners. 

Would like to see more patrols by parkies after the curfew time to shut down the early a.m. parties though. Beautiful sandy beach and clear blue water. This provincial park is a great place to stay Large tenting area. Beach and water is perfect. Activities for kids and lots of hiking opportunity. Crystal clear water lake and tan sand. Kids enjoyed snorkeling. Pristine beach, well organised, lots of things to do and see. Wonderful place to spend quality time with friends and family. Beautiful spot. I will be back. 👍 Great park.

Lovely beach, hiking trails to suit every fitness level including a trail that is wheelchair accessible, great interpretive centre ... Massive campsite with lots of amenities (Hikes, beach, interpretive centre, showers). It was a bit too much of a party campsite (noisy, drunks, etc) and very expensive for my tastes but it was also like a friendly little town during the day.

My only recommendation would be to give more beach space to the dogs because it seems every other campsite has 1-2 dogs. Great place to camp or day trip. Have been going here for years.

I only have a few concerns:

1 - The firewood cost $7.50 for ... One of the best provincial parks I have stayed at. The canoeing is amazing. Good trails and nice a quiet nights perfect for just hanging around a campfire. First time camping.. had a wonderful experience.. it was cold but still enjoyed it thoroughly.. lots of activities to do and lots of trekking to do.. fun to be with friends and family.. There are two camping sections in this park - the Mazinaw Campground is the one where the sites are pretty close together with little privacy. Hardwood Hills is set further away from the water, and the road to it is very poorly ... Very beautiful. Rented a canoe and stayed over night. Wonderful camping spots Amazing place. Very clean and fresh water for swimming. Great camping sites. The comfort places need a little bit of an upgrade but overall a great place for a family outing. Not a bad place to camp!

Liked how the rangers there leave you alone :) The campsite itself was nice- there's a picnic ... We only used the park facilities to park our truck and launch our kayaks.

This is an iconic provincial park that has good hiking opportunities to go with their numerous types of campgrounds. There is also a lot of really cool paddling opportunities along the Mazinaw cliff. This is probably one of the most beautiful provincial Parks in Ontario. I would 100% recommend to rent canoe and take a tour around the cliffs and pictographs. You can also get to the island with a canoe so that you have to pay for a ferry. Great park. Great for canoeing and hiking. We will be coming back next year. LOVE. best fall camping ever. we went the first week of Oct. it was quiet and peaceful. Went camping in June. Had a fantastic time.
Swimming, hiking, biking and canoeing are just a few things you can do here.
Well maintained lots with very friendly service. Highly recommended. Camping at any Provincial Park is so peaceful and amazing. This one has multiple beaches, numerous hiking trails and just so many beautiful sights. Truly great Great park, I loved paddling past the cliff face and seeing the pictographs.  But we nearly lost the ability to rent a canoe shops debit machine was down and I had to go to the marina outside the park to get cash. Nice park with a long canoe route and a crazy 1.5km portage. The hiking route is also nice and flexible. Do the whole 17km in one go, make it back using one of the two shorter trails or book a camp site in the trail. Nice hikes. Nice camping (went at Hardwood). Decent sanitary installations. Would recommend it! This is a larger provincial park compared to other parks in the area (of course, except the Algonquin), and is usually packed with campers.
Because there are just too many people in the park, there is not enough space to enjoy quietness ... Very nice place for camping. We missed the boat ride to the other side. I enjoyed the beach. Great place to camp! Loved the kayaking adventures and the hiking trails were great. Such a nice park with lots to do. Good beaches, good sites. Go there for a day or stay there for a week. It's worth it. Gorgeous park. Perfect for families with little kids. The hiking trail to the little mountain is amazing. Beautiful, clear, sandy beach. Great sites and beaches. The staff were friendly and helpful. The thing that makes this place unbareable is the type of clientele you have around you. People are obnoxious and disrespectful of other peoples enjoyment of the space. ... One of Ontario's largest Provincial Parks is a great place to camp or just visit for the day. After the Great Lakes, Mazinaw Lake is the deepest in Ontario at 479 feet. Mazinaw Rock is a 330 foot cliff that straddles the lake and ... A bit pricey y for the day and the hikes are way to o easy, but its a lovely spot to discover for sure. Lots to do.. Gorgeous area.. But SUPER overcrowded and alot of sites have no privacy between them.. Feel like your sharing your site with several other strangers.. Won't be going back to camp but maybe for day use Loved it! Camped in the 400 sections, sites are way more private here. Did the boat ride and hike up the mountain. Great family trip. This park is claimed a pet friendly area however they fine you for the dog’s bark - rangers excessively monitor your site and watch for every time they bark. This completely ruins your experience, and along with that they fine you $95 unreasonably for “excessive barking” The lake there is just the perfect spot for breezy relaxing canoeing. The canoe’s are available for rental by the lakeside. Nice park for hiking and camping. Very quiet. Good for boating and swimming. Great site for camping. Nice and clean showers, friendly and helpful staff, little bit crowded but it's big site so it's not that bad. Only disappointing thing was canoe rental service wasn't open because they don't have any vendor yet. ... Beautiful place that offers a variety of camping types. The backcountry is a nice hike. The canoeing is great. The views of Mazinaw rock are stunning. Staff is friendly, and generally the facilities are great. Love this park!!  Beautiful lake for canoeing and kayaking. Very quiet. First time camping there and I had a really great time. The beach and the camping ground were amazing..I'm definitely coming back here again This is a beautiful park with a lot of history. The trails were well maintained and staff were friendly. Nice park. Staff and Friends of the park are awesome. Little noisy n the campground. 2 nights the music went past 11pm. Amazing view. Loved the hike Been going here since I was a very little kid. Best campground around, hands down. So much to see and do, and even after 20+ years it never gets old. One of my favourite places to camp. The boat tour and the views are worth the trip Nice place to visit during fall season Amazing views! Staff are wonderful... will be back soon :)

never been there.... Amazing place filled with history and legend. Perfect for family camping, kayaking, hiking and more Great park to take the fam to and have an amazing time! Highly recommended! Very nice park. Whole family had fun As always excellent experience. Although the comfort stations could do a little upgrade. Otherwise it was amazing trip as always. :) Nice park. Weird they don't even sell ice in the park. Seems not as well run as other parks. Need canoe rentals in June. But great beaches and lots of places to paddle. I always love how beautiful Bon Echo is, what a fabulous place to go camping! We had an amazing time even through the rain. The cliff was beautiful during the sun set and during the fog! Absolutely gorgeous! Day trip is a bit of tight to do everything. Two days visit is worth. Great for camping with the Dogs, beautiful dog beach that humans can swim at too, clear, clean  water and an overall non buggy. We love it here and try to go back each year. Beautiful park. Nice trails. Clean comfort stations. Lovely beaches. Nice staff. Very beautiful park with lots of fun to be had in the front or back-country. Totally recommend the back-country camping on a clear starry night. Absolutely stunning, everything about this park was beautiful. The ferri ride to the cliff was fun, the cliff itself was an amazing view. The hikes were really good. I recommend Bon Echo to everyone! Great Area for camping. Beautiful scenery and a lot of wildlife. Great wilderness areas and clean, modern facilities. The explorer tent was spacious and bug-free. The lagoon area is run down and needs renovations. Pros:
Staff are great
Nice views 
Equipment rentals are cheap
Clean facility

Cons:
Sites have very little privacy Great camping site - well organized and maintained.  Clean showers.  A lot of water stations throughout.

The hike at Mazinaw is well worth it. 

Went in August after a few dry heat days, bugs were sleeping.  Got lucky and escaped the ... Our first time here. A little disappointed. The bugs were the worsed ever.  Bug spray was only somewhat helpful. Boat rental still closed. Dogs are not permitted on the Ferry, neither are stroller, lucky you are aloud to bring your kids. ... You just can't beat Bon Echo. Best campground I've ever seen. Large, spacious, level sites surrounded by forest. Loads to do. Ya just can't beat it. Hiking & Glamping - August 31 to September 2 2018
Kayaking - September 7 2018

What an incredible few days!

Visitor Center: Learn about the natural and native history, animals, geology, early settlers, the Bon Echo Inn and how the park ... One of my favorite camp grounds so far Good times! I recommend kayaking here its gorgeous. Camping is very decent for a park It's good place to spend your day trip. Their boats services is very poor. It pains me to leave just 2 stars for this absolutely gorgeous part of Ontario, but the stupid barking dogs ruined it for us.  Inconsiderate dog owners - I will never understand why they think it's ok to let their dog bark.  If we wanted ... Stayed 2 night in carbin. Carbin is large, comfort and looks very new. Very big site. Washrooms were clean but shower water was too hot to enjoy. Too many mosquitoes. Bug spray was not helping.. Very nice area for a family day out. Sandy beach and picnic tables under the tall trees. When I went,  I booked last minute. The only campsites that were available were rated as ""very poor"". But when I arrived,  there was nothing wrong with my campsite other than a rock in the ground that could be avoided. The swimming was ... Favourite place to go just to get away. I always enjoy going to Bon Echo, it's a beautiful park with a kid friendly beach. Beautiful backcountry to camp in, lots of bugs, more people than expected, but we'll maintained trails and helpful staff Great Park. Pretty good privacy compared to some camping grounds. Fantastic views from the beaches. Amazing spot to get away! Clean park and water. Lots of activities to keep your time occupied. Joeperry Lake is a lovely, sand bottom lake. The landings can be rocky, but if you've already done the 850m walk in, with all your stuff, from the parking lot, no big deal. Deer fly season is a bit much. But the park is very well maintained. Even the back country spots. I really enjoyed this place. Great for first time backpackers. Sites aren't well maintained in Hardwood Hills. Beautiful beach. Prices for parking beyond one vehicle per site are ridiculous. Amazing combination of warm, top water and cold water in the bottom. Perfect place to spend a sunny day! Awesome park with an excellent beach. Only down side was the road to Hardwood hill campground had no dust control. First time there at the day use area for Canada 🍁 Day. Although it was crowded there was still ample room to set up our area and swimming was lots of fun with everyone all around. The scenery is also spectacular!!! May be one of the best parks in Ontario.   The facilities are clean and checked often.  Staff is very friendly, including the park police.  Multiple beaches with different swimming experiences.  Our dog was well accepted by staff and the ... Fantastic! We only got to spend an hour or two, but we'll be back before summer is over! Beautiful spot and great staff!

One of the most beautiful parks in ontario. Holy friggin moscitos!!! Nothing will keep them away. Place is gorgeous and very friendly staff. Love the fact that they have showers, laundry facilities on site. By far on of the best provincial parks in Ontario, HUGE campsites and lots to do! One of the best places I ever go for camping Amazing for families, canines are so clean and grill is new :) 
Washrooms are so clean and today. Nice place for camping and water activities, you can also do BBQ there. The place has clean washrooms comparing to other places They provide campsites but I prefer to hike through wilderness on a day pass.  This has several nice trails.  I hiked the Abes and Essens Trail and liked the variation in scenic surroundings.  I toured the waterfront near the Mazinaw ... Great interior camping, but it's true beauty lies in the back country camping! Beautiful park. Make sure to book ahead of time. Not a good place for last minute. It's worth the drive up. Good place for the family or a friendly get away. Great place to stay on the shoulder season. Love this park. I've been going every year since I was 6 No words to describe this placs just plain awesome Our favourite place to camp. Fantistic hiking trails and canoeing.

Rent a canoe or kayak or paddle board...the water is absolutely serene. Only spent the day at the park really nice we'll be coming back for more Beautiful park. Clean facilities and really nice staff. Great campground if you can get a site booked Amazing park beaches are great but the ice and food is a 10 min drive to cloyne which is a bit of a pain Beautiful amazing views! Will visit this place often! Got a kayak and didn't have cash but the guy let me pay him the next day! So nice! Ended up paying the next day and getting another hour and the other dude let me take my time (spent ... Have taken a lot of cadets there over the years and they always seem to enjoy it plus it's a great drive to slightly northern Ontario.

It was a beautiful park the facilities could use some help Awesome walk in camping sites! Amazing views on the lake, but very poor site privacy Beautiful trees, forest, lake and trails.
Very good program for your children during summer vacation. It is good place to get experience for canoeing and boating on the lake.
When you shout in the middle of the lake rock will respond good echo.
That's why the named Bon Echo! Great lake for swimming and boating, easy to handle a kayak or canoe with minimal wave action. The park across to Mazina Rock is only 0.5Km so can be a quick boat trip or spend the whole day on the water! Viewing the stars was nice from ... Beautiful beaches. Spectacular cliffs. Amazing location for hiking and camping Tired to canoe out to our spot. Water ended up being to low. Was able to get another drive in location. Nothing like the pictures very dirty. Would recommend the canoe in spots as they were very quite and peaceful. This is our favorite Provincial park.  It's clean, the Wardens are often seen, but rarely heard (We've been harassed at another park.)  Sites are spacious.   We feel good about letting the kids bike around, the trails are close enough ...

Lots of trails, canoeing opportunities, swimming, beautiful large private campsites. Dog beach and exercize trail. Great spot. Very scenic. Tours available. Overnight camping. Lots of wind most days. Lots of flies the rest What beauty. What history. What legacy. Great Provincial Park, with lots to do, very popular, early booking is a must. Still an inspiring view and awesome climb Great scenary canoeing beach.  Just mosquitoes were problem.

Beautiful in the fall One of my favorite provincial parks. Clean beaches, including one dogs can swim at. And the cliffs are breathtaking Enjoyed the boat tour very much!

As you venture along the water at the base of the iconic, 100m, vertical cliff that is Mazinaw rock you will discover native pictographs and an engraved ... You have to visit here at least once to understand it.  A review simply can't do it justice.  It's a great spot for camping with a family because of the visitor centre and other facilities.  The hike to the top across the lake is great ... Great place.  Wonderful boat ride to a place where you can go for about an hrs hike to 3 lookouts.  What they say is true about the washrooms... horrible.   Showers are not too bad.  They have a very nice store. This review is for the campground only. The surrounding area, the lake, the cliffs, and the vista are five star by Ontario standards (i.e., not a lot to look at compared to the Rockies, Quebec, or anywhere else really). The campground is ... Great place to camp One of my favourite parks to visit. I never get tired of he canoeing/kayaking in front of the mighty Mazinaw Rock.

Good sites and amazing scenery Amazing place for the whole family Great place for camping.  Wide range of different campsites to choose from, drive-in and walk-in sites.

Book early for better selection of sites Amazing!!! Beautifully wooded area. Awesome caping. Great beach. Beautiful park with lots of hiking opportunities.

Variety of different campsites for whichever type of camping you prefer (canoe in, trailer, cabins etc) Watch out for the ""death rock"" in Joe Perry Lake. One of the best parks in Ontario, mostly because of its famous Mazinaw Cliffs Very family oriented but not the place to go if you want peace and quiet. Great for kids. Nice beaches and boat launches. Fishing and hiking is spectacular. The fire wood they sell is terrible!!! Buy your own in the way in. We bought a bag on site and it was a soaking wet waste of money that wouldn't burn at all.  You'll want to go back again!  We just spent a week here in our 18ft TT.  We stayed in the Sawmill Bay section.  Park is very well kept, clean and good facilities.  There is lots too do here; 3 beaches, hiking trails, mountain biking, ... Beautiful scenery, smooth and large lake. Rentals are inexpensive Such a gorgeous place. Kayaking over the still clear waters to look at ancient pictographs on the cliffs, then going down river and checking out the turtles, plus bike riding up and down the hills. Bliss.

The campsites are well structured, they offer everything that is needed, even a picnic table on the sites on the far end of the lakes. Will definitely come back here more times.

Arrived late (1am) unpacked, slept like a champ, enjoyed walking  & birdwatching along trails in am...wanted to check out the rock but had to make tracks! Going back in 2 weeks!

Comfort stations are poorly kept  Beautiful nature Amazing place. Lots of things to do like hiking, canoeing, swimming and taking lots of pictures of that breathtaking Clift. Really nice campgrounds and an awesome place! Typical Ontario provincial park sites. Many points of interest. The rock face on Lake Mazinaw is spectacular. Decent beach, hiking, biking. Cool camp store/museum. Some beautiful scenery and some nice campsites - the radio free campsites are a tent city with very little privacy and way too many citiots. Visited on April 16. Heavy rain, park not opened yet. Stunning scene. Will never forget in my life. Visited in the middle of May again, amazing beautiful place. Great place to go camping Camp sites are decent but not very private. Comfort stations could have been kept a little cleaner. Really beautiful lake. Nice hikes. Take a canoe if you want to see the pictographs (we did not). Our campsite was on a major slope, but it was in the shade. Too many mosquitos (I guess that's what we get for camping in July). If you are ... Amazing place to camp!

No showers and the toilet consisted of a box situated further into the woods. The ... Whether it's family camping or backcountry camping in islands in the park, you will enjoy your camping experience here Beautiful scenery. Make sure you check out the island.

The facility is very good, hot water shower and lots of taps Best provincial park in ontario. Love it beautiful there The park is beautiful, but we're quitting camping in Ontario.

Our campsite was perfect, the kayak rental was a ton of fun, the trails are spectacular and the stars, oh the stars 🙌🏼 Quiet, peaceful and beautiful. The outhouses have flush toilets.

I have been a resident of Ottawa for  10 years and I never knew that such beauty can be found so close to home! 
Bon Echo is by far the prettiest provincial park I have been to near the capital region. Everything, the beach, the sunset, the cliffs, and lake, is stunning. 
Will come again for sure. Hiked the 15k loop around the lakes, magically scene, trail was an adventure, very clean, saw about 10 bear poops! Fantastic park! Spent the weekend on Joeperry Lake before checking out the pictographs. Good times. Mazinaw Lake and Rock are stunningly beautiful.

Gorgeous scenery to kayak through and the hiking trail is amazing! Lovely lake and natural areas and also some interesting history and culture. Beaches and hiking are great too.  Very scenic, has options for activities. Pets are allowed and there is a doggy water area Rangers are very strict here-so if you're a loud bunch probably not the place/ or definitely don't go in the radio free zones.  Beautiful provincial park; it's one of my favorite places to visit. Love this place! Nice and big campground, very private. The sites are very open here.  Not alot of privacy.  The canoeing is fabulous and the staff is very helpful. Beautiful place to visit. Ferry that take you across to other side of water is fun. Amazing scenery If I have to explain why this is a 5-Star experience, that’s sad. Nice grounds and amazing scenary.  Only complaint is that we sensed a bit of racism from caucasian campers there.  Almost felt unwelcomed.  Mixed feelings about revisiting. Can't believe that some people blame bugs on the park!!! If you go camping in June or July you are going to get eaten!  The park is wonderful. We camped in hardwood hill, and privacy was great (owing to the fact the one camp site close ... Great place love it Amazing park to camp at, did both backcountry and walk-in sites. Amazing scenery, and has relatively easy access.

Fewer people, water still warm enough to swim off the small sand beach and bugs have, mostly, had their day. May need to ... It was really fun and great adventure. Hiking at night and looking at the stars was a great feeling. Beautiful location and excellent trails. Camp sites are small and feel cramped. Lots of sites are uneven so be careful when booking. Great clean facilities. Friendly staff. Can't wait to go back Beautiful park, nice camp grounds and friendly staff.  Amenities could be a bit better maintained Beautiful place Great scenic views around the water and a great camping experience. Loved the stay. I can not tell u how much I HATE this park! Gloomy and depressing. The black flies and mosquitoes are sooo thick! BUG Echo more like it! Hate it! Beautiful place! We stayed in one of their backcountry campsites and it was the nicest we have ever been to in any park hence the 5 stars. If you don't have a canoe or kayak they are available for rent in the park. However the car camping sites that we saw looked overcrowded and consequently didn't offer much privacy. Amazing campsites, beautiful beaches, entertaining programs and plenty of wildlife! By far my favorite camping grounds in Canada! Good place to relax Great camping experience in one of many Ontario Provincial Parks. Among the standard features like canoe rental and abundance of awesome hiking trails you also get a hundred meters high cliff which you can climb or canoe by it as it ... awsome Great place and one of my most favorite provincial parks.

Beautiful park. a great place to relax with family or friends and take in nature! Wonderful camping. Always have a great time here. Park staff are very cheerful and helpful.  Great sites and trails Great camping, canoing/kayaking and swimming, but the Mugwump ferry was changed and it was not a goog experience.  Took double the time from the new dock.

Several beaches - the day use beach has a lovely big swimming area and plenty of sand for the kids to play in, plus the picnic area overlooks it from a rise.

Nice place for camping and amazing views A little too crowded for camping READ
the hills area is FAR from the ""downtown"" camping stuff (beaches, showers ect). And when I say far, I mean, 10-15 min drive out there. If you want seclusion, go there. Mazinaw ect are much better choices to access the park amenities.  it is very cold and very windy and trees can fall down on your car and you can lose stuff easily Stayed at one if the cabins on Bon Echo lake. So peaceful and quiet! Loads of activities for all ages. Excellent wooded area, great beach (two, actually), plenty of camping sites to choose from. Nearest grocery store is about 20 minutes drive South (Foodland).  I've been backpacking here several times.  It's so beautiful and relaxing. Too many mosquitos, bugs, and there were only 1 washroom that had large bug. There were also stinky outhouses where the seats are moldy and disgusting. This review is for the main camp ground (East of the highway).

The highlight of this park is the ancient writing and pictures on the cliff walls. Very interesting to see, but you need to canoe or take a boat tour to see them.

I only have a few concerns:

1 - The firewood cost $7.50 for ... One of the best provincial parks I have stayed at. The canoeing is amazing. Good trails and nice a quiet nights perfect for just hanging around a campfire. First time camping.. had a wonderful experience.. it was cold but still enjoyed it thoroughly.. lots of activities to do and lots of trekking to do.. fun to be with friends and family.. There are two camping sections in this park - the Mazinaw Campground is the one where the sites are pretty close together with little privacy. Hardwood Hills is set further away from the water, and the road to it is very poorly ... Very beautiful. Rented a canoe and stayed over night. Wonderful camping spots Amazing place. Very clean and fresh water for swimming. Great camping sites. The comfort places need a little bit of an upgrade but overall a great place for a family outing. Not a bad place to camp!

Liked how the rangers there leave you alone :) The campsite itself was nice- there's a picnic ... We only used the park facilities to park our truck and launch our kayaks.

We made it late on Friday; an hour before midnight but managed to reach site 300B where Bob was ... The place was absolutely packed and it has 400 campsites. There were hundreds of people packed in.

There are a LOT of mosquitos in the forest though, went in for 15 minutes and came ... This is an iconic provincial park that has good hiking opportunities to go with their numerous types of campgrounds. There is also a lot of really cool paddling opportunities along the Mazinaw cliff. This is probably one of the most beautiful provincial Parks in Ontario. I would 100% recommend to rent canoe and take a tour around the cliffs and pictographs. You can also get to the island with a canoe so that you have to pay for a ferry. Great park. Great for canoeing and hiking. We will be coming back next year. LOVE. best fall camping ever. we went the first week of Oct. it was quiet and peaceful. Went camping in June. Had a fantastic time.
Swimming, hiking, biking and canoeing are just a few things you can do here.
Well maintained lots with very friendly service. Highly recommended. Camping at any Provincial Park is so peaceful and amazing. This one has multiple beaches, numerous hiking trails and just so many beautiful sights. Truly great Great park, I loved paddling past the cliff face and seeing the pictographs.  But we nearly lost the ability to rent a canoe shops debit machine was down and I had to go to the marina outside the park to get cash. Nice park with a long canoe route and a crazy 1.5km portage. The hiking route is also nice and flexible. Do the whole 17km in one go, make it back using one of the two shorter trails or book a camp site in the trail. Nice hikes. Nice camping (went at Hardwood). Decent sanitary installations. Would recommend it! This is a larger provincial park compared to other parks in the area (of course, except the Algonquin), and is usually packed with campers.
Because there are just too many people in the park, there is not enough space to enjoy quietness ... Very nice place for camping. We missed the boat ride to the other side. I enjoyed the beach. Great place to camp! Loved the kayaking adventures and the hiking trails were great. Such a nice park with lots to do. Good beaches, good sites. Go there for a day or stay there for a week. It's worth it. Gorgeous park. Perfect for families with little kids. The hiking trail to the little mountain is amazing. Beautiful, clear, sandy beach. Great sites and beaches. The staff were friendly and helpful. The thing that makes this place unbareable is the type of clientele you have around you. People are obnoxious and disrespectful of other peoples enjoyment of the space. ... One of Ontario's largest Provincial Parks is a great place to camp or just visit for the day. After the Great Lakes, Mazinaw Lake is the deepest in Ontario at 479 feet. Mazinaw Rock is a 330 foot cliff that straddles the lake and ... A bit pricey y for the day and the hikes are way to o easy, but its a lovely spot to discover for sure. Lots to do.. Gorgeous area.. But SUPER overcrowded and alot of sites have no privacy between them.. Feel like your sharing your site with several other strangers.. Won't be going back to camp but maybe for day use Loved it! Camped in the 400 sections, sites are way more private here. Did the boat ride and hike up the mountain. Great family trip. This park is claimed a pet friendly area however they fine you for the dog’s bark - rangers excessively monitor your site and watch for every time they bark. This completely ruins your experience, and along with that they fine you $95 unreasonably for “excessive barking” The lake there is just the perfect spot for breezy relaxing canoeing. The canoe’s are available for rental by the lakeside. Nice park for hiking and camping. Very quiet. Good for boating and swimming. Great site for camping. Nice and clean showers, friendly and helpful staff, little bit crowded but it's big site so it's not that bad. Only disappointing thing was canoe rental service wasn't open because they don't have any vendor yet. ... Beautiful place that offers a variety of camping types. The backcountry is a nice hike. The canoeing is great. The views of Mazinaw rock are stunning. Staff is friendly, and generally the facilities are great. Love this park!!  Beautiful lake for canoeing and kayaking. Very quiet.

The trails were well maintained and staff were friendly. Nice park. Staff and Friends of the park are awesome. Little noisy n the campground. 2 nights the music went past 11pm. Amazing view. Loved the hike Been going here since I was a very little kid. Best campground around, hands down. So much to see and do, and even after 20+ years it never gets old. One of my favourite places to camp. The boat tour and the views are worth the trip Nice place to visit during fall season Amazing views! Staff are wonderful... will be back soon :)

never been there.... Amazing place filled with history and legend. Perfect for family camping, kayaking, hiking and more Great park to take the fam to and have an amazing time! Highly recommended! Very nice park. Whole family had fun As always excellent experience. Although the comfort stations could do a little upgrade. Otherwise it was amazing trip as always. :) Nice park. Weird they don't even sell ice in the park. Seems not as well run as other parks. Need canoe rentals in June. But great beaches and lots of places to paddle. I always love how beautiful Bon Echo is, what a fabulous place to go camping! We had an amazing time even through the rain. The cliff was beautiful during the sun set and during the fog! Absolutely gorgeous! Day trip is a bit of tight to do everything. Two days visit is worth. Great for camping with the Dogs, beautiful dog beach that humans can swim at too, clear, clean  water and an overall non buggy. We love it here and try to go back each year. Beautiful park. Nice trails. Clean comfort stations. Lovely beaches. Nice staff. Very beautiful park with lots of fun to be had in the front or back-country. Totally recommend the back-country camping on a clear starry night. Absolutely stunning, everything about this park was beautiful. The ferri ride to the cliff was fun, the cliff itself was an amazing view. The hikes were really good. I recommend Bon Echo to everyone! Great Area for camping. Beautiful scenery and a lot of wildlife. Great wilderness areas and clean, modern facilities. The explorer tent was spacious and bug-free. The lagoon area is run down and needs renovations. Pros:
Staff are great
Nice views 
Equipment rentals are cheap
Clean facility

Cons:
Sites have very little privacy Great camping site - well organized and maintained.  Clean showers.  A lot of water stations throughout.

The hike at Mazinaw is well worth it. 

Went in August after a few dry heat days, bugs were sleeping.  Got lucky and escaped the ... Our first time here. A little disappointed. The bugs were the worsed ever.  Bug spray was only somewhat helpful. Boat rental still closed. Dogs are not permitted on the Ferry, neither are stroller, lucky you are aloud to bring your kids. ... You just can't beat Bon Echo. Best campground I've ever seen. Large, spacious, level sites surrounded by forest. Loads to do. Ya just can't beat it. Hiking & Glamping - August 31 to September 2 2018
Kayaking - September 7 2018

What an incredible few days!

Visitor Center: Learn about the natural and native history, animals, geology, early settlers, the Bon Echo Inn and how the park ... One of my favorite camp grounds so far Good times! I recommend kayaking here its gorgeous. Camping is very decent for a park It's good place to spend your day trip. Their boats services is very poor. It pains me to leave just 2 stars for this absolutely gorgeous part of Ontario, but the stupid barking dogs ruined it for us.  Inconsiderate dog owners - I will never understand why they think it's ok to let their dog bark.  If we wanted ... Stayed 2 night in carbin. Carbin is large, comfort and looks very new. Very big site. Washrooms were clean but shower water was too hot to enjoy. Too many mosquitoes. Bug spray was not helping.. Very nice area for a family day out. Sandy beach and picnic tables under the tall trees. When I went,  I booked last minute. The only campsites that were available were rated as ""very poor"". But when I arrived,  there was nothing wrong with my campsite other than a rock in the ground that could be avoided. The swimming was ... Favourite place to go just to get away. I always enjoy going to Bon Echo, it's a beautiful park with a kid friendly beach. Beautiful backcountry to camp in, lots of bugs, more people than expected, but we'll maintained trails and helpful staff Great Park. Pretty good privacy compared to some camping grounds. Fantastic views from the beaches. Amazing spot to get away! Clean park and water. Lots of activities to keep your time occupied. Joeperry Lake is a lovely, sand bottom lake. The landings can be rocky, but if you've already done the 850m walk in, with all your stuff, from the parking lot, no big deal. Deer fly season is a bit much. But the park is very well maintained. Even the back country spots. I really enjoyed this place. Great for first time backpackers. Sites aren't well maintained in Hardwood Hills. Beautiful beach. Prices for parking beyond one vehicle per site are ridiculous. Amazing combination of warm, top water and cold water in the bottom. Perfect place to spend a sunny day! Awesome park with an excellent beach. Only down side was the road to Hardwood hill campground had no dust control. First time there at the day use area for Canada 🍁 Day. Although it was crowded there was still ample room to set up our area and swimming was lots of fun with everyone all around. The scenery is also spectacular!!! May be one of the best parks in Ontario.   The facilities are clean and checked often.  Staff is very friendly, including the park police.  Multiple beaches with different swimming experiences.  Our dog was well accepted by staff and the ... Fantastic! We only got to spend an hour or two, but we'll be back before summer is over! Beautiful spot and great staff!

Love the fact that they have showers, laundry facilities on site. By far on of the best provincial parks in Ontario, HUGE campsites and lots to do! One of the best places I ever go for camping Amazing for families, canines are so clean and grill is new :) 
Washrooms are so clean and today. Nice place for camping and water activities, you can also do BBQ there. The place has clean washrooms comparing to other places They provide campsites but I prefer to hike through wilderness on a day pass.  This has several nice trails.  I hiked the Abes and Essens Trail and liked the variation in scenic surroundings.  I toured the waterfront near the Mazinaw ... Great interior camping, but it's true beauty lies in the back country camping! Beautiful park. Make sure to book ahead of time. Not a good place for last minute. It's worth the drive up.

Ended up paying the next day and getting another hour and the other dude let me take my time (spent ...

Very good program for your children during summer vacation. It is good place to get experience for canoeing and boating on the lake.
When you shout in the middle of the lake rock will respond good echo.
That's why the named Bon Echo! Great lake for swimming and boating, easy to handle a kayak or canoe with minimal wave action. The park across to Mazina Rock is only 0.5Km so can be a quick boat trip or spend the whole day on the water! Viewing the stars was nice from ... Beautiful beaches. Spectacular cliffs. Amazing location for hiking and camping Tired to canoe out to our spot. Water ended up being to low. Was able to get another drive in location. Nothing like the pictures very dirty. Would recommend the canoe in spots as they were very quite and peaceful. This is our favorite Provincial park.  It's clean, the Wardens are often seen, but rarely heard (We've been harassed at another park.)  Sites are spacious.   We feel good about letting the kids bike around, the trails are close enough ...

The hike to the top across the lake is great ... Great place.  Wonderful boat ride to a place where you can go for about an hrs hike to 3 lookouts.  What they say is true about the washrooms... horrible.   Showers are not too bad.  They have a very nice store. This review is for the campground only.

One of the best parks in Ontario, mostly because of its famous Mazinaw Cliffs Very family oriented but not the place to go if you want peace and quiet. Great for kids. Nice beaches and boat launches. Fishing and hiking is spectacular. The fire wood they sell is terrible!!! Buy your own in the way in. We bought a bag on site and it was a soaking wet waste of money that wouldn't burn at all.  You'll want to go back again!  We just spent a week here in our 18ft TT.  We stayed in the Sawmill Bay section.  Park is very well kept, clean and good facilities.  There is lots too do here; 3 beaches, hiking trails, mountain biking, ... Beautiful scenery, smooth and large lake. Rentals are inexpensive Such a gorgeous place.

Great place to go camping Camp sites are decent but not very private. Comfort stations could have been kept a little cleaner. Really beautiful lake. Nice hikes.

Great beach and the rock is great to explore Large provincial park with a wide variety of things to do and many campsites.  Canoeing, swimming, hiking/backpacking are all great here, as well as the scenery by the lake.  One puzzling thing - why is there no park store to buy some ...

Highly recommend canoeing to the base of the cliff and hiking up to the top. ... Beautiful nature. Good size hikes. Amazing photo opportunities. Wonderful spot Had a good time here. I was little surprised at the pet restrictions but it wasn't a deal breaker. The hiking was just ok with sime decent scenery. Great hiking Trail Beautiful campground.

You really feel that ""peaceful energy"" all around !!
When I feel stress out I just admire all of my breath talking pictures I have ! It's truly my and my boyfriend ""happy place "" !!! Great place to visit Loved camping here. Beautiful area and lots to do. The misquotes were a bit much, even with spray, but the park is nice. Will return during September, when the misquotes aren't going as strong.

Good picnic spots right next to the lake. Designated and safe swimming area for children. Great park for camping, biking, canoeing! Amazing view of the cliff from almost anywhere. I have been a resident of Ottawa for  10 years and I never knew that such beauty can be found so close to home! 
Bon Echo is by far the prettiest provincial park I have been to near the capital region. Everything, the beach, the sunset, the cliffs, and lake, is stunning. 
Will come again for sure. Hiked the 15k loop around the lakes, magically scene, trail was an adventure, very clean, saw about 10 bear poops! Fantastic park! Spent the weekend on Joeperry Lake before checking out the pictographs. Good times. Mazinaw Lake and Rock are stunningly beautiful.

Gorgeous scenery to kayak through and the hiking trail is amazing! Lovely lake and natural areas and also some interesting history and culture. Beaches and hiking are great too.  Very scenic, has options for activities. Pets are allowed and there is a doggy water area Rangers are very strict here-so if you're a loud bunch probably not the place/ or definitely don't go in the radio free zones.  Beautiful provincial park; it's one of my favorite places to visit. Love this place! Nice and big campground, very private. The sites are very open here.  Not alot of privacy.  The canoeing is fabulous and the staff is very helpful. Beautiful place to visit. Ferry that take you across to other side of water is fun. Amazing scenery If I have to explain why this is a 5-Star experience, that’s sad. Nice grounds and amazing scenary.  Only complaint is that we sensed a bit of racism from caucasian campers there.  Almost felt unwelcomed.  Mixed feelings about revisiting. Can't believe that some people blame bugs on the park!!! If you go camping in June or July you are going to get eaten!  The park is wonderful. We camped in hardwood hill, and privacy was great (owing to the fact the one camp site close ... Great place love it Amazing park to camp at, did both backcountry and walk-in sites. Amazing scenery, and has relatively easy access. All you need is some warm sunny weather after Labour Day and before Canadian Thanksgiving and this park is heaven. Fewer people, water still warm enough to swim off the small sand beach and bugs have, mostly, had their day. May need to ... It was really fun and great adventure. Hiking at night and looking at the stars was a great feeling. Beautiful location and excellent trails. Camp sites are small and feel cramped. Lots of sites are uneven so be careful when booking. Great clean facilities. Friendly staff. Can't wait to go back Beautiful park, nice camp grounds and friendly staff.  Amenities could be a bit better maintained Beautiful place Great scenic views around the water and a great camping experience. Loved the stay. I can not tell u how much I HATE this park! Gloomy and depressing. The black flies and mosquitoes are sooo thick! BUG Echo more like it! Hate it! Beautiful place! We stayed in one of their backcountry campsites and it was the nicest we have ever been to in any park hence the 5 stars. If you don't have a canoe or kayak they are available for rent in the park. However the car camping sites that we saw looked overcrowded and consequently didn't offer much privacy. Amazing campsites, beautiful beaches, entertaining programs and plenty of wildlife! By far my favorite camping grounds in Canada! Good place to relax Great camping experience in one of many Ontario Provincial Parks. Among the standard features like canoe rental and abundance of awesome hiking trails you also get a hundred meters high cliff which you can climb or canoe by it as it ... awsome Great place and one of my most favorite provincial parks.  Beautiful sites and beach, nice trails and very clean bathrooms and showers. One of the best provincial campgrounds in Ontario.  Wish they would put a store on grounds.

Beautiful park. a great place to relax with family or friends and take in nature! Wonderful camping. Always have a great time here. Park staff are very cheerful and helpful.  Great sites and trails Great camping, canoing/kayaking and swimming, but the Mugwump ferry was changed and it was not a goog experience.  Took double the time from the new dock.  You get stuck on the other side of the lake after your hike and you fight for a spot to get back. This is an amazing place. Breathtaking scenery.. Had so much fun camping here.

There's no information on the ferries or tour boats (hint: get your ... This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. Rent a canoe and paddle down to see the pictographs at sunset. Hike up to the top of the rock. Swim at one of many lovely beaches. Ride your bike around and explore. ... Great park! Has something for everyone. Beautiful. Several beaches - the day use beach has a lovely big swimming area and plenty of sand for the kids to play in, plus the picnic area overlooks it from a rise. A lot of parents seemed to be using this to great advantage to sit back in the shade while their kids played on the beach. stayed for 4 days mid-august and the weather was perfect. this was our first time camping here and it won't be our last - and this is coming from someone who used to hate camping! hardly any mosquitos, but lots of hungry raccoons! lock ... Beautiful park. Canoe rentals were very cheap. We saw falcons and rock climbers while we were on the lake. If you find the right place, hearing the echo at the cliff is really cool.

With a boat you can see paintings on the rock walls. Great kayaking park, beautiful scenery, worth a visit for sure Beautiful scenery.

Nice place for camping and amazing views A little too crowded for camping READ
the hills area is FAR from the ""downtown"" camping stuff (beaches, showers ect). And when I say far, I mean, 10-15 min drive out there. If you want seclusion, go there. Mazinaw ect are much better choices to access the park amenities.  it is very cold and very windy and trees can fall down on your car and you can lose stuff easily Stayed at one if the cabins on Bon Echo lake. So peaceful and quiet! Loads of activities for all ages. Excellent wooded area, great beach (two, actually), plenty of camping sites to choose from. Nearest grocery store is about 20 minutes drive South (Foodland).  I've been backpacking here several times.  It's so beautiful and relaxing. Too many mosquitos, bugs, and there were only 1 washroom that had large bug. There were also stinky outhouses where the seats are moldy and disgusting. This review is for the main camp ground (East of the highway).

There is a timmies in front of the park. Edit: The park is not worth if we just want to visit and enjoy the scenery as the entry fee is too expensive.

I mainly ride on the east side of the park (Oakville side) from the campground area. I am getting annoyed with the number of dogs who are running leash free but are not trained to do so properly. I ... This is a nice little park with easy to do trails for everyone. Fall colours are nicely visible given the right timing. Great for a simple day trip from Toronto. There's plenty of parking and picnic spots as well and the trail maps they provide are very useful. This park is a wonderful get away from the ""city"" life of Burlington.   It's not like say Algonquin park with dense forests and a remote escape but it's more prairies and fields which has a beauty in all its own and perfect for sun and ... Lovely park with something for everyone. A little forested oasis in the city/suburbia. Day use area has a children’s barn and play areas, a farm and walking trails. Campground side also also an off leash area for dogs that we love. Went to Bronte Creek Provincial Park to take some footage for my YouTube channel.

The Learn to camp experience was amazing great staff, lucky only one rain shower otherwise great weather, support, equipment & wildlife.
Sadly we agree ... Its a great place to visit. We did a camp there for a day for the first time and it turned out to be great. Planning to go again for loger duration. In the camp site, if they could add.some kids play area that would be awesome. Thanks Rad. I am currently looking at booking I camping trip and I understand your review, but their response was what is turning me off of the park. Bronte Creek management just lost my business. I will be booking somewhere else.

In ... I usually enjoying going there. I'm have been going there for 3 yrs. But recently I had a bad experience. I had my trialed parked there for 2 weeks. I was to pay  but I didn't get in time to pay so they gave my spot away. I had a family ... Very clean and quiet park. Lots of fun trails to choose from. Great place to bring your dog! Little known trail on east side of Bronte River, north of Dundas, north of provincial park.
Outside of provincial park, so no fees.
Some of the best hiking, mountain biking trails/jumps in Halton Region.
Stretches for kilometers,  even north of 407 overpass. Great park!! amazing nature walks, and the pool site is fantastic! Bring your own chairs, towels & umbrellas! always a great time at bronte The overall facility is looking a little run down.  The pool is still nice overall and is good for kids of all ages.  The trees that were planted are the wrong type and because of that aren't very big which causes problems with respect to sufficient shade. Charge a ridiculous $17 for parking. Really expensive for a lone hiker. The pool is nice, the trails are nice, but I could hear noise from 401 all the time. I can’t understand why people would rate this so high. I took my son there today to see the animals and explore. Extremely limited, several exhibits were closed. I can’t understand how they can get away with charging nearly $20. Absolute ... This was our first time camping, and it was the best experience of my life! We went a family of 6, with grandparents and kids. Clean washrooms, awesome, polite staff. I will definitely be coming back! I love this place, but I want to make a quick note, about customer service.. everytime someone posts a poor review the “owner” is very abrasive and a bit condescending. When a customer is upset, take ownership, appologize, ... Nice place and nice scenery! Didn't expect to pay. But its $17 per car! Beautiful mountain bike trails and hiking trails! Some are intermediate and some are advanced! The place is a beauty and it has a nice farm to visit that shows the life of old farmers. Great for kids.

clean place Excellent place to spend the day. The barn with a indoor and outdoor playplace plus some animals. We spend the day at the pool and the evening at the barn. The kids love it. Lots of trails to enjoy a long walk. Washrooms are clean. There is a drinking water fountain near the barn and also at the pool entrance. Well maintained big outdoor pool - 100% worth it. Wasn't sure what to expect when we pulled into the park this weekend.  As strange as it sounds the first thing I thought was "" wow nice clean heated bathrooms"" which was a huge plus since it was cold out before we started to run....so ... Very nice place with many amenities including outdoor swimming pool and farm place Great provincial park, that is conveniently located between Oakville and Burlington. Lots of things to do with the kids including a farm with a play barn. Great place to bike, hike, or just relax with the family. Highly recommended. Also has a great toboggan hill. Parking was too pricey if you just want to check out the park for a few hours, attractions should be paid for on a case by case basis instead of being baked into the parking price GREAT park not to far away. Again for the long weekend ... the sites grass was not cut. Major shortfall .... Heights ticks fleas mosquitos and dangerous to even walk around. Nice escape from town. Properly carved and maintained trail. Huge Leash free zone for dogs to roam. Oh and Forgot the mention the beautiful view of creek from hill. I only ever go to Bronte for disc golf, but I try to make it out as often as I can. Great course for the area. Bring a few friends in one car, since entry to the park is charged by the carload. We only accessed the pool area so this review is only focused on that. Glad to see life guards on duty at all times from all towers. Water was reasonably clean but not the cleanest. Entry to the park fees don't include the Pool area. Not ... A nice park with plenty to do for kids, good picnic areas, and some nice shorter walks. You do hear the sound of vehicle traffic as you're close to major roadways, but it's not too bad. The cost: $17 per vehicle. Makes it a special treat destination and not a regular destination. A wonderful Oasis in the Middle of the bustling city. Clean, well maintained sites. Electricity only: no water hookups or sewers. Generally clean washrooms and showers, except on long weekends when the staff get a little overwhelmed. ... Amazing park to go on a nice trekking trip, very quiet on the walking trails, i did almost 8.5 km and we didn't finish all park during our walk, you get to part with nice river. I like it some areas free leash for the dogs to have lots ... This is a beautiful provincial park.  The cities of Oakville and Burlington are growing up on either side.  As a Burlington resident I love bringing my family here.  Great hikes, scenery, and activities for little kids We love going to Bronte Creek! Play barn for kids, farm animals, learning centre, lots of open space for playing, forest tails for hiking. Large swimming pool, picnic areas, and more. Camping available at the east side of the park. DON'T USE THE POP MACHINES, THEY WILL EAT YOUR MONEY! Too expensive of a park. Why have such a high price for entry. $17. Nope I'd much rather save that and go to a lot of other palces. Entry should be free or atleast cheaper, attractions should be paid. Nice disk golf course! Very nice provincial park with animals farm. Great experience for kids to see or even sometimes feed some animals. Good hike to the creek starts at the very end of area F. Great experience. Camping for 2 nights. Sites were clean of garbage, facilities were pretty clean, showers were a little hot and not adjustable. Evening ranger shows were great for kids. Try to get a site near the park if you have kids, or farther away if you dont A typical Ontario Provincial Park, thought it is now in the city, with a subdivision outside the gate and along property line. Could use more sites for ""big"" rigs.  On the other hand they offer Learn to camp (tent) program.  Rv pads aren't all level left to right. The park has a great leash free dog walking trail. Very beautiful as to the area, great place to have a picnic small or bigger family's! A lot of information about the park and the family that lived there! Someone famous person from way in the past, animals and especially there are bathrooms! What a great place for kids and adults. Lots to do and see. The pool is the biggest pool I have ever been in. There are animals and barns, old houses to tour, a place to fly a kite. You can BBQ and have a pic knick. Bathrooms are very clean. Highly recommend.  Great park, good amount of restrooms and pretty well maintained .  They have some great events as well.  No EV charging however.

We come here for small races (5/10km) and always have a good time.  Parking can be a little pricey in my opinion. Great provincial park, entry fee of $17 per car is expensive but the massive pool (bigger than wonderland I think) makes up for it, as well as the trails that lead into the hill and a waterfall. Well worth it if you bring a full car with you. Excellent park. Really enjoyed the trail there.! Beautiful lookout. Went there for a picnic, great park Great park! Lots of trails and things to do. One of our faves! We buy a summer pass every year now just for the amazing off leash area alone. Well worth the money. No 5 stars because no water hookup. Surprising wild space inside the city. The rangers are so helpful and the sites are private and very spacious! The camping at Bronte Creek is so close to home but a world away! Great facilities that are well maintained by friendly and competent parks personnel make for wonderful stays.

The leash free park and trails is huge and a fan favorite.

This is an amazing resource in the heart of the GTA. lots of green space...espacious trails...smood sound river....centenial trees and plenty of fresh air..... Nice facility, if a bit on the chilly side for the water temp. Bring a great deal of sunscreen, and bring some shade. The park desperately needs to tree up a bit in order to keep kids sun safe. Great place to have picnics and go on hikes. Nice playground for kids in a barn. They usually have interactive programs throughout the year. Downside is the parking fee of $17 per vehicle. Nice trail walks. Also has a Hindu ashes immersion site by the river. It's a bit of a walk through som nice farms but we'll worth it. Has some farm animals like goats, hens, cows, horses. Kids will love it.  As of Father's Day Weekend
No access to park from campground. 
Pool closed after driving over there.
No real shade. 
Over zealous security.
Could be good someday with allot more work but not there yet. Great air, relaxing scenery, and close to Mount Nemo and Rattlesnake Point. Love cruising these roads or stopping at the bunch of spots, even more than what I mentioned if you just keep going ;) Great child friendly pool with gradual incline. You can pretty much bring anything you can wheel into the pool area which makes for convienient drinks and meals. Always lots of activities in the barn and for maple syrup and car lovers Huge park with a lot of things to do. Good picnic sites. Great kids programs. Play barn for kids. Domestic animals. Hiking trails. Open year around. Big outdoor pool open in summer (admission is extra).  Clean pool for the amount of children. Excellent trails, cute animals, and a neat Victorian home to visit. Very quiet, with lots of tables to eat and bbq. Well maintained. A little bit expensive to access the park but it is worth it Nice little secluded camp sites very close to town. Unfortunately you can still hear the highway at night. But the coyotes were still louder than the cars ;-). It is also convenient location. Mediocre park. More of an $6 than $17 park. Animals for kids are pretty disappointing. No snack facilities. Their 4.3 rating overall baffles me. Have been to this park before but the parking staff were very unhelpful, rude and arrogant! Yes we know it is 30degrees and summer but even with seniors in the car they were not allowed to be dropped at the pool! Either they are trained ... Bang for the buck. One admission per car gets the whole carload in. Tonnes to do. Play barn. Live stock. Nature trails the creek. Park Ranger programs and activities leash free section in the park. Certain events have stuff to purchase, usually food n such. Great pool for the kids and pretty cool events :) Great fun for kids. A huge wading pool with life jackets if needed, a barn that's been converted into a playground, and a very small petting zoo.
$17 per vehicle to enter the park. Pool admission $3.75/adult $2.75/youth. Barn playground $FREE. Great place but watch out for some walkers and dog walkers - they are getting aggressive. 

Also, doggie poop bags should go in the garbage can, nowhere else. 

Staff is very helpful here.  Nice park in the middle of the city . It has massive outdoor pool and nice place to bike and hike. Very nice camping spots..good trails. There are limited washrooms but not bad. There are some great running and mountain biking trails on this side of Bronte Creek Provincial Park. They are accessible from a few different locations with one following the creek along the top of the valley with good views. It is a nice park for a day trip from toronto.really nice bike trails and barnyard for kids to play and pet animals.lots and lots of picnic spots.There is a paid outdoor pool ,but we didn't use it.
But the park entry fee of 17$ is a lot in my opinion.should be reduced to around 10-12. Getting to be a bit run down but the pool is still great fun and lots of nice trails. Watch out for dogs on the East side of the park. I was bitten bloody *outside* of the off leash area. Many dog owners treat it as a de facto dog park in the off season when it isn't staffed. Enter at your own risk.  Interesting place,lots of stuff to do,but weird that your only 2 minutes from civilization and can see people's backyard from your site Bronte Creek is great, it has hiking paths, walking paths, various locations to explore for children and there are also several areas that feature cows that are friendly. If you mountain bike there is an enjoyable mostly easy ride that ... Love this place. Huge parking lots so no more circling around for parking spots even during busy weekend. Lovely trails, lots of picnic areas, giant outdoor swimming pool, barns and petting farm ani.als for kids, an old preserved farm house etc. Perfect location for picnic. Great to bbq food.

Great place to take a walk Amazing camping facility, loved all the fun and educational activities for kids of all ages. Very clean and lots of shower facilities...pool is on the other side of the camping area but a short drive to a big lifeguarded pool! Very friendly staff everywhere we went ! Thank you from Ottawa ! Bronte children's farm a great place for young children. They love the Children's Play Barn. Large dog walking community on off leash natural trails, so you dont have to stand in some gated square. Great activities for familiesl, petting farm, swimming, mountain biking, camping. Warden can be very strict and not community minded. Beautiful.  Camp site was big and had all grass on it.  Very quiet. This park is wonderful for friends and family gatherings. It has an outdoor pool, five great hiking trails, Bronte Creek Ravine, a farm house with live farm animals interesting for children, and disk golf course.

You can have camping ... Beautiful place, nice places for the charcoal bbq. Lots of walking and cycling trails nearby. Pool is also a good activity for the kids.  Really nice escape in the city. Go early and you can easily feel like you're the only one around at times. Pool looks really nice as well. Drawback is that the sound of the qew seems everpresent when you are at the bottom half of the park.   Very badly mapped. No proper sign boards and directions. All you see is parking lot A, B, C, etc. And you are lost completely.
Was a frustrating experience for almost everybody. Nobody had a clue where to go and what to do.
Everybody was ... Had a great time with the fam! Facilities were clean and the park was great sun or rain. Nice walking trails too Have been to the park twice this year, once at the end of August and once today (Dec. 11th) While we enjoyed both visits, we were discouraged by a few things. We were quite disappointed with how little the volunteers knew about the park ... Amazing provincial park. Has swimming pool as well as an area for kids to play. Lots of greenery and hosts children's events all year round. Very run down park used to be a great park they said new renovated barns = does not look new. And staff questions they here a phone to call maybe they can help me. Lmfao. Great pool and other facilities. There were lots of people, but it never felt crowded. One awkward thing is that I lost my shirt and my wife checked the lost and found and got it back, just 5 minutes after I checked and the guy I asked said nothing had been turned in today... I spent a week here this summer and had a great time. I found all the park staff to be extremely cheerful and helpful. The campsites are well maintained. The shower area and bathrooms were kept clean. And best of all its centrally ... Well enjoyed by our family who was having a birthday party. Permits are needed for the pavilions but the park it self is nice with the family areas being for the most part clean and bathrooms being a 5/10.

Its not a real farm but I can't say we didn't have fun. Amazing park. Water pool nice and clean. Kids farm with playground. Lots of options fro picnic.  My family and I have been coming to Bronte to camp for 10 years now. We always have a great time! Great activities for the kids, and beautiful area to hike and walk your dogs! 🏕 I actually went hiking here in the evenings! It's really beautiful and the nature is pretty amazing? I've stayed at this campground from the day it opens in April to the very last day it closes in october for the past 2 years. No it doesn't have water or sewer hook ups but if you plan your site knowing where the facilities are there ... We went to the pool on Saturday but none of the signs said where the pool was. When we arrived the attendant at the gate said the pool was 500 away from capacity and said nothing more. We assumed there would be clear signage. We had to ... Hats off to those who maintain the disc golf course. A lot of fun to come here and play. Disc gold course great, well maintained! Beautiful park that's so close by.  Very close to Toronto.  Nice camping spots plus they have disc golf! Many people don't know about the camping at Bronte Creek Prov Park. Excellent. Nice sites, private, clean. We went there for the weekend early this year to test out our camper. Love the bike and walking trails. If you want to see the other side of the park (West of the river) you will need to drive there. Love this place. Pool is awesome. Great family place  Great beach like pool, fun kids play barn (check hours) and cute animals!  Not sure why they charge $17 admission. City money grab I gather. Not much there, much nicer places with better places for events and better play areas for the kids in Oakville that do not charge entrance fees. I went for a party.  Never again. Perfect place to spend the day The compsite that was given was not only small but the workers did not let us sing songs at night as it was too laud?? I've been camping for the past 3 years, no one ever complained or worried about campers singing ! Worst experience ... The entrance fee was $17!!, and u still have to pay extra for the pool! The picnic areas are so dry , note enough shade. Great place to visit, go for a walk, play with the kids. Small petting zoo/farmyard with indoor play area as well. Brilliant place to go camping with kids, lots to do, friendly staff and great trails.  Wonderful park for families with kids. There are play barn, a little farm, trails, swimming pool in the summer Such a great experience specially in Winter for kids, tourists and for Newcomers to Canada .. A must go to destination ..

Great Disc Golf course on site for beginners and Advanced players. The barn is fun. And everyone likes animals... so yea. Good times.  Very nice piknik areas huge pool for kids and cute little farm $20 to gain access and i'm not sure i'll be returning also if you have to pay separate price for pool i'm totally not having it. It's a very spacious area with different parts which is great but for the price could be more barbecue's, ... I like it here. Nice park and a lot of stuff to do. And little pricy but you pay for the convenience  We took 3 kids to the park today, we saw a goat and a cow. Most areas of the park were off limits. There really wasn't much to do for the kids and so my main gripe is this, why make people pay full summer price to enter the park when ... Great place to relax. Very fresh air compared to city. Lots of hiking opportunities. One of my best park to visit! There are plces for Kids, excellent Bronte Creek and many seasonal activities. We love to visit this place. Decent park with a huge pool.

Go there quite often. Will continue to.  Nice camp sites, walking trails, and conveniently located in Halton region. A great piece of forest right in the middle of the city!

One of the best parks in the area with lots of nature trails and farm animals. The park is pretty nice!!

A beautiful place to be, when the fall season is in full swing. Don't waste your money on this overpriced park, it's nothing special for the fee they charge.  Go to Rattlesnake Point instead!

This park is absolute crap. $17 dollars for two adults and on top of that.... $10 dollars PER person (which was not disclosed to us at the gate) to get into the junky packed outdoor room temperature pool.

The Learn to camp experience was amazing great staff, lucky only one rain shower otherwise great weather, support, equipment & wildlife.
Sadly we agree ... Its a great place to visit. We did a camp there for a day for the first time and it turned out to be great. Planning to go again for loger duration. In the camp site, if they could add.some kids play area that would be awesome. Thanks Rad. I am currently looking at booking I camping trip and I understand your review, but their response was what is turning me off of the park. Bronte Creek management just lost my business. I will be booking somewhere else.

In ... I usually enjoying going there. I'm have been going there for 3 yrs. But recently I had a bad experience. I had my trialed parked there for 2 weeks. I was to pay  but I didn't get in time to pay so they gave my spot away. I had a family ... Very clean and quiet park. Lots of fun trails to choose from. Great place to bring your dog! Little known trail on east side of Bronte River, north of Dundas, north of provincial park.
Outside of provincial park, so no fees.
Some of the best hiking, mountain biking trails/jumps in Halton Region.
Stretches for kilometers,  even north of 407 overpass. Great park!! amazing nature walks, and the pool site is fantastic! Bring your own chairs, towels & umbrellas! always a great time at bronte The overall facility is looking a little run down.  The pool is still nice overall and is good for kids of all ages.  The trees that were planted are the wrong type and because of that aren't very big which causes problems with respect to sufficient shade. Charge a ridiculous $17 for parking. Really expensive for a lone hiker. The pool is nice, the trails are nice, but I could hear noise from 401 all the time. I can’t understand why people would rate this so high. I took my son there today to see the animals and explore. Extremely limited, several exhibits were closed. I can’t understand how they can get away with charging nearly $20. Absolute ... This was our first time camping, and it was the best experience of my life! We went a family of 6, with grandparents and kids. Clean washrooms, awesome, polite staff.

clean place Excellent place to spend the day. The barn with a indoor and outdoor playplace plus some animals. We spend the day at the pool and the evening at the barn. The kids love it. Lots of trails to enjoy a long walk. Washrooms are clean. There is a drinking water fountain near the barn and also at the pool entrance. Well maintained big outdoor pool - 100% worth it. Wasn't sure what to expect when we pulled into the park this weekend.  As strange as it sounds the first thing I thought was "" wow nice clean heated bathrooms"" which was a huge plus since it was cold out before we started to run....so ... Very nice place with many amenities including outdoor swimming pool and farm place Great provincial park, that is conveniently located between Oakville and Burlington. Lots of things to do with the kids including a farm with a play barn. Great place to bike, hike, or just relax with the family. Highly recommended. Also has a great toboggan hill. Parking was too pricey if you just want to check out the park for a few hours, attractions should be paid for on a case by case basis instead of being baked into the parking price GREAT park not to far away. Again for the long weekend ... the sites grass was not cut. Major shortfall .... Heights ticks fleas mosquitos and dangerous to even walk around. Nice escape from town. Properly carved and maintained trail. Huge Leash free zone for dogs to roam. Oh and Forgot the mention the beautiful view of creek from hill. I only ever go to Bronte for disc golf, but I try to make it out as often as I can. Great course for the area. Bring a few friends in one car, since entry to the park is charged by the carload. We only accessed the pool area so this review is only focused on that. Glad to see life guards on duty at all times from all towers. Water was reasonably clean but not the cleanest. Entry to the park fees don't include the Pool area. Not ... A nice park with plenty to do for kids, good picnic areas, and some nice shorter walks. You do hear the sound of vehicle traffic as you're close to major roadways, but it's not too bad. The cost: $17 per vehicle. Makes it a special treat destination and not a regular destination. A wonderful Oasis in the Middle of the bustling city. Clean, well maintained sites. Electricity only: no water hookups or sewers. Generally clean washrooms and showers, except on long weekends when the staff get a little overwhelmed. ... Amazing park to go on a nice trekking trip, very quiet on the walking trails, i did almost 8.5 km and we didn't finish all park during our walk, you get to part with nice river.

As a Burlington resident I love bringing my family here.  Great hikes, scenery, and activities for little kids We love going to Bronte Creek! Play barn for kids, farm animals, learning centre, lots of open space for playing, forest tails for hiking. Large swimming pool, picnic areas, and more. Camping available at the east side of the park. DON'T USE THE POP MACHINES, THEY WILL EAT YOUR MONEY! Too expensive of a park. Why have such a high price for entry. $17. Nope I'd much rather save that and go to a lot of other palces. Entry should be free or atleast cheaper, attractions should be paid. Nice disk golf course! Very nice provincial park with animals farm. Great experience for kids to see or even sometimes feed some animals. Good hike to the creek starts at the very end of area F. Great experience. Camping for 2 nights. Sites were clean of garbage, facilities were pretty clean, showers were a little hot and not adjustable. Evening ranger shows were great for kids. Try to get a site near the park if you have kids, or farther away if you dont A typical Ontario Provincial Park, thought it is now in the city, with a subdivision outside the gate and along property line. Could use more sites for ""big"" rigs.  On the other hand they offer Learn to camp (tent) program.  Rv pads aren't all level left to right. The park has a great leash free dog walking trail. Very beautiful as to the area, great place to have a picnic small or bigger family's! A lot of information about the park and the family that lived there! Someone famous person from way in the past, animals and especially there are bathrooms! What a great place for kids and adults. Lots to do and see. The pool is the biggest pool I have ever been in. There are animals and barns, old houses to tour, a place to fly a kite. You can BBQ and have a pic knick. Bathrooms are very clean. Highly recommend.  Great park, good amount of restrooms and pretty well maintained .  They have some great events as well.  No EV charging however.

We come here for small races (5/10km) and always have a good time.  Parking can be a little pricey in my opinion. Great provincial park, entry fee of $17 per car is expensive but the massive pool (bigger than wonderland I think) makes up for it, as well as the trails that lead into the hill and a waterfall. Well worth it if you bring a full car with you. Excellent park. Really enjoyed the trail there.! Beautiful lookout. Went there for a picnic, great park Great park! Lots of trails and things to do. One of our faves! We buy a summer pass every year now just for the amazing off leash area alone. Well worth the money. No 5 stars because no water hookup. Surprising wild space inside the city. The rangers are so helpful and the sites are private and very spacious! The camping at Bronte Creek is so close to home but a world away! Great facilities that are well maintained by friendly and competent parks personnel make for wonderful stays.

The leash free park and trails is huge and a fan favorite.

This is an amazing resource in the heart of the GTA. lots of green space...espacious trails...smood sound river....centenial trees and plenty of fresh air..... Nice facility, if a bit on the chilly side for the water temp. Bring a great deal of sunscreen, and bring some shade. The park desperately needs to tree up a bit in order to keep kids sun safe. Great place to have picnics and go on hikes. Nice playground for kids in a barn. They usually have interactive programs throughout the year. Downside is the parking fee of $17 per vehicle. Nice trail walks. Also has a Hindu ashes immersion site by the river. It's a bit of a walk through som nice farms but we'll worth it. Has some farm animals like goats, hens, cows, horses. Kids will love it.  As of Father's Day Weekend
No access to park from campground. 
Pool closed after driving over there.
No real shade. 
Over zealous security.
Could be good someday with allot more work but not there yet. Great air, relaxing scenery, and close to Mount Nemo and Rattlesnake Point. Love cruising these roads or stopping at the bunch of spots, even more than what I mentioned if you just keep going ;) Great child friendly pool with gradual incline. You can pretty much bring anything you can wheel into the pool area which makes for convienient drinks and meals. Always lots of activities in the barn and for maple syrup and car lovers Huge park with a lot of things to do. Good picnic sites. Great kids programs. Play barn for kids. Domestic animals. Hiking trails. Open year around. Big outdoor pool open in summer (admission is extra).  Clean pool for the amount of children. Excellent trails, cute animals, and a neat Victorian home to visit. Very quiet, with lots of tables to eat and bbq. Well maintained. A little bit expensive to access the park but it is worth it Nice little secluded camp sites very close to town. Unfortunately you can still hear the highway at night. But the coyotes were still louder than the cars ;-). It is also convenient location. Mediocre park. More of an $6 than $17 park. Animals for kids are pretty disappointing. No snack facilities. Their 4.3 rating overall baffles me. Have been to this park before but the parking staff were very unhelpful, rude and arrogant! Yes we know it is 30degrees and summer but even with seniors in the car they were not allowed to be dropped at the pool! Either they are trained ... Bang for the buck. One admission per car gets the whole carload in. Tonnes to do. Play barn. Live stock. Nature trails the creek. Park Ranger programs and activities leash free section in the park. Certain events have stuff to purchase, usually food n such. Great pool for the kids and pretty cool events :) Great fun for kids. A huge wading pool with life jackets if needed, a barn that's been converted into a playground, and a very small petting zoo.
$17 per vehicle to enter the park. Pool admission $3.75/adult $2.75/youth. Barn playground $FREE. Great place but watch out for some walkers and dog walkers - they are getting aggressive. 

Also, doggie poop bags should go in the garbage can, nowhere else. 

Staff is very helpful here.  Nice park in the middle of the city . It has massive outdoor pool and nice place to bike and hike. Very nice camping spots..good trails. There are limited washrooms but not bad. There are some great running and mountain biking trails on this side of Bronte Creek Provincial Park. They are accessible from a few different locations with one following the creek along the top of the valley with good views. It is a nice park for a day trip from toronto.really nice bike trails and barnyard for kids to play and pet animals.lots and lots of picnic spots.There is a paid outdoor pool ,but we didn't use it.
But the park entry fee of 17$ is a lot in my opinion.should be reduced to around 10-12. Getting to be a bit run down but the pool is still great fun and lots of nice trails. Watch out for dogs on the East side of the park. I was bitten bloody *outside* of the off leash area. Many dog owners treat it as a de facto dog park in the off season when it isn't staffed. Enter at your own risk.  Interesting place,lots of stuff to do,but weird that your only 2 minutes from civilization and can see people's backyard from your site Bronte Creek is great, it has hiking paths, walking paths, various locations to explore for children and there are also several areas that feature cows that are friendly. If you mountain bike there is an enjoyable mostly easy ride that ... Love this place. Huge parking lots so no more circling around for parking spots even during busy weekend. Lovely trails, lots of picnic areas, giant outdoor swimming pool, barns and petting farm ani.als for kids, an old preserved farm house etc. Perfect location for picnic. Great to bbq food.

Bronte children's farm a great place for young children. They love the Children's Play Barn. Large dog walking community on off leash natural trails, so you dont have to stand in some gated square. Great activities for familiesl, petting farm, swimming, mountain biking, camping. Warden can be very strict and not community minded. Beautiful.  Camp site was big and had all grass on it.  Very quiet. This park is wonderful for friends and family gatherings. It has an outdoor pool, five great hiking trails, Bronte Creek Ravine, a farm house with live farm animals interesting for children, and disk golf course.

You can have camping ... Beautiful place, nice places for the charcoal bbq. Lots of walking and cycling trails nearby. Pool is also a good activity for the kids.  Really nice escape in the city. Go early and you can easily feel like you're the only one around at times. Pool looks really nice as well. Drawback is that the sound of the qew seems everpresent when you are at the bottom half of the park.   Very badly mapped. No proper sign boards and directions. All you see is parking lot A, B, C, etc. And you are lost completely.
Was a frustrating experience for almost everybody. Nobody had a clue where to go and what to do.
Everybody was ... Had a great time with the fam! Facilities were clean and the park was great sun or rain. Nice walking trails too Have been to the park twice this year, once at the end of August and once today (Dec. 11th) While we enjoyed both visits, we were discouraged by a few things. We were quite disappointed with how little the volunteers knew about the park ... Amazing provincial park. Has swimming pool as well as an area for kids to play. Lots of greenery and hosts children's events all year round. Very run down park used to be a great park they said new renovated barns = does not look new. And staff questions they here a phone to call maybe they can help me. Lmfao. Great pool and other facilities. There were lots of people, but it never felt crowded. One awkward thing is that I lost my shirt and my wife checked the lost and found and got it back, just 5 minutes after I checked and the guy I asked said nothing had been turned in today... I spent a week here this summer and had a great time. I found all the park staff to be extremely cheerful and helpful. The campsites are well maintained. The shower area and bathrooms were kept clean. And best of all its centrally ... Well enjoyed by our family who was having a birthday party.

When we arrived the attendant at the gate said the pool was 500 away from capacity and said nothing more. We assumed there would be clear signage. We had to ... Hats off to those who maintain the disc golf course. A lot of fun to come here and play. Disc gold course great, well maintained! Beautiful park that's so close by.  Very close to Toronto.

We went there for the weekend early this year to test out our camper. Love the bike and walking trails. If you want to see the other side of the park (West of the river) you will need to drive there. Love this place. Pool is awesome. Great family place  Great beach like pool, fun kids play barn (check hours) and cute animals!  Not sure why they charge $17 admission. City money grab I gather. Not much there, much nicer places with better places for events and better play areas for the kids in Oakville that do not charge entrance fees. I went for a party.  Never again.

It's a very spacious area with different parts which is great but for the price could be more barbecue's, ... I like it here. Nice park and a lot of stuff to do. And little pricy but you pay for the convenience  We took 3 kids to the park today, we saw a goat and a cow. Most areas of the park were off limits.

A pleasant provincial park with awesome Maple syrup in the winter Very good place specially the pool side. The park is surprisingly tranquil despite the fact that it is surrounded by urbanization.  There is a wonderful pool that is built to resemble a lake. Nice park but $17 per car entry Needs more mountain bike trails and less people walking their dogs with 10ft leashes.

A beautiful place to be, when the fall season is in full swing. Don't waste your money on this overpriced park, it's nothing special for the fee they charge.  Go to Rattlesnake Point instead!

This park is absolute crap. $17 dollars for two adults and on top of that.... $10 dollars PER person (which was not disclosed to us at the gate) to get into the junky packed outdoor room temperature pool.

Take a time and come to visit this Park. Fantastic place to go with the family. Lots of services and amenities It's a great place, but $17 a car is too expensive.

Amazing family camping.  So many activities.  Very peaceful! For car Camping, this is by far one of the best parks to go to. However, I am basing my review on the backcountry sites.

Slim bay is great, it's the same as it was 20 some years ago, the last time I was there. Pretty good paddling and camping sites, a little busy and built up for my tastes.

 Love the hikes and the water. Nice park,  the site was really big.  Had enough space for 3 tents and 2 cars. Being everything ur gonna need because there are no stores close by. Oh,  lots of raccons. Good, not great.  Sites in the Meadowlands are lacking an form of privacy and they charge quite a bit extra for additional vehicle that is still parked on your own site. A very beautiful slice of Ontario nature.  I love coming here. The camping itself is really nice. The bathrooms and showers are exceptionnally clean! The reasons why I am giving 2 stars are because there were too many raccoons and the campsites were too close to each other.

There were so many ... A beautiful clean lake with spectacular views+great staff! Super clean. Well run park. Lots of raccoons. It's my favorite provicial park, and...what can I say?

Always a nice place to camp to Charleston Lake is a wonderful Provincial Park.  We hiked in to Blue Mountain from the south and had a great afternoon doing it. Great place to stay,  great people  would be nice if you had a website that can be easily used. I have been trying to book a campsite all day. I cant call the park to get reservation and have to pay money to use your site and it doesn't even work!!! I have a booking but your site is saying I don't! and will not let me pay! this is illegal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Beautiful Lake. Great for water sports Lots of great trails, quiet lake I just called to make a change to my reservation from September 4th to September 5th, and was told that I would have cancel my reservation instead of changing it. This means that I would have to pay the online reservation fee again. ... Beautiful place, fantastic for swimming and kayaking Picturesque This is a fun park. It is busier that most parks but it's great for day tripping and easy interior/backwoods camping. Beautiful Lake! Unreal!!!! Loved it!!!!? Perfection Pretty neat place. Love our winter walks It's really hard to choose between Very Good and Excellent - depends on a point of view and comparison. So from the point of view of the person, who is used to go to Quebec parks - large campgrounds, not very crowded - this place is ... Awesome place to go camping!

Some campsites backing on residential. Adequate spacing between sites.   Picturesque river but no real place to swim...only good wading for kids.  Off-leash fenced dog park near the water. Adjacent town has basic amenities. We only had an overnight stay at this park, but We loved it. Nice sites, clean bathrooms, good showers, friendly staff. The waterfalls are nice. The swimming area looks good as well although we weren't able to try it on our stay.  This is a nice quiet park. Beautiful woodsy park that was empty except for our camper, in September 2018.  Mind you, it was raining buckets. Sites were large with wooded verges visually separating the sites. My only downer was having to pay for electricity even though we didn't use any. And the train that loudly whistled by across the river The water at this beach is warm and clean...ideal for little children.
There is a warning for older children who might wander off. Don't. Don't go down river from here. Can't swim there! It's very dangerous to follow this river too near ... Great, flat site with water spigots everywhere. We watched the grounds crew cleaning up sites and they do a great job. Lots of great hiking spots and very clean and easy showers. been going to chutes for the last 30 years and always a great time Good for relaxed camping but not if you are looking to escape into the back woods. River swimming and a 6km trail are the highlights for us. Showers are also a plus.

If you're looking to go for a swim, our family always brings a few ... Beautiful waterfalls. Nice campground. Really nice main toilet building. Beautiful park but can see city street lights at night ... too close to people's houses This park is a hidden gem. The only thing missing for me are the lack of biking trails. Very clean comfort stations. Good privacy and very nice walking trails. The water was warm but be wary of the river currents. Nice size campground. Nice swimming area at bottom of the falls which has low and deep areas. Great for families. Wheel chair assesible washroom and campsites. Clean washrooms and showers.Very nice groomed trails. Large lots. Close to little towns and Sudbury. Really nice park, sites are a nice size. We had plenty of room with our 28ft trailer and pick up truck. Bathrooms are very clean. The mosquitoes were the only bad thing about our stay. Great  Camping... Quite and lots are well spaced out. Beauty location. Also as a bonus, given its proximity to Massey allows the park to use the municipal water supply, meaning that water does not have to be boiled before drinking.
Beauty trails with great scenery ...especially the falls!! The falls are a great place to explore - we spent the whole day there. Campsites were well maintained and a good size. Could hear noise from town, including a party going on at a cottage just on the other side of the fence. Good place for a one or two night stopover on a family trip Big treed sites with electrical only. Hot, clean showers and great water pressure  Friendly park staff and beautiful scenery. Highly recommend. We stayed two nights in a 24 foot 5th wheel. Few hundred meters from trans Canada highway. Nice camp ground close to River and scenic water falls. Nice park for stop overs....the dumping station needs to have trees cut down so that bigger vehicles can navigate the turn easier and not worry about damage. 
The same goes for getting into some sites....trees need to be removed in order to have a better turning radius....other than that the provincial parks are wonderful Beautiful waterfront quiet park Had a great weekend. Nice place to camp for a night or two. Cleanest bathrooms and showers I ever experienced in any government park in North America Awesome for family.  Great swimming areas for little and big kids. Frigid night in mid July but stunning views and quieter than the other parks along Lake Superior Nice place!
The only downsides are the damn train at night and the power distributor location. I love this little park. Really nice campsites and swimming area with the chute.  Love the trail.

I soon found out that a few steps away from my campsite ... Great park! It was quiet and peaceful. Staff were always friendly. Amazing trail and waterfalls. Only downside was he beach, expected an actual beach but this was mostly pebbled. Would suggest adding a bit more sand as we had looked forward to swimming and lying on the shore! Everything else was great though. Pretty cool place, wish i had more than just a couple hours there. perfect place to take a doggo with ya. Be weary of the rocks near the water, wearing boots I slipped on em like they were made of ice and almost went for a swim Great winter hike.  Snowshoes were not needed on this day as the trail has been broken.  Trekking poles are still a good idea with some icy spots. Great swimming area. Excellent food truck parked near the entrance in the summer that serves 'Indian tacos'. Lovely place to spend the day! Great park. Nice walking trails and scenery. I hate this place. All the smoke fills the town in summer. Everyone on this side of town is at risk of smoke inhalation Good camping facilities with a great waterfall... This is a fairly small park with a lot to offer.

The Chutes is a fun little park! Most parks have a lake with a beach, Chutes has a river with some small rapids you can splash around in.  Lots of large, private campsites, dog use area and some hiking trails.  It's more of a stop-over or stay 2-3 nights type of place. Very pretty small park, good clean sites. One of the most beautiful trails past several falls. Great park for a weekend or a 2 or 3 day stopover. We had an awesome time here. Our site was close enough to the water falls that you could hear it all day and night which we loved . Natural sound machine ! Our site was also perfectly private so find a location near the falls if you can ... Nice park, very clean and modern washrooms and showers. The pit toilets were well maintained and didn't smell. Good trails with nice scenery. Park is close to a general store that has many flavours of ice cream and a chip stand. A beautiful park! The trails and scenery are absolutely amazing! A very clean and quiet park.  A Definite recommend and we will be back!  The best feature of this park is the waterfalls! You must hike around the many waterfalls and rapids then you will see the natural beauty of this park. Beautiful place! Only stopped to see the water fall on our adventure to Sault ste Marie. I would highly recommend checking it out. I plan to go camping there at some point Great camping trip as always! My new favourite camping location! My partner and I stayed in the RF zone and it was so quiet and peaceful! The staff were friendly and helpful, the only reason I docked one star is due to the cleanliness of the bathrooms.

Calm with many private sites that are quite shaded.  Gorgeous walking trails.  Rocky beach with very little shade, but shallow and perfect for kids. Nice trail, nice community, nice waterfall. Peaceful place to camp  I could not find the info i needed Best swimming area locally. Rapids beside the beach are fun to float down during summer water levels. Hiking trail is short, but scenic. Love it, can't wait to go back. Awesome park! Swimming area/beach is nice and campsites are not crowded together like alot of other provincial parks. Will be back!  It's a place to sleep. Little to do. Rather boring. It's clean. But it's just a place to spend the night on the way to a better place. Beautiful! Great spot beside the Trans-Canada.

Fractured plates of shale that form our shoreline contain fossils that are 450 million years old
Flat rock is ideal for launching a sailboat, kayak/canoe, paddle board, wind surfing, fishing or watching a spectacular sunset
Located at the Base of Blue Mountain we are an ideal hub to enjoy what the local area has to offer.

Don't know where to start staff was awesome. Bathrooms where so clean. Loved the swimming. The other campers where so friendly.  Definitely going back next season. The best part about the park is access to the lake. It's beautiful and shallow. Lovely place for families. We were camping close to the highway and it was loud. If you can't get a spot right on the lake, don't go. Those spots are quieter. I give the camp ground a 5, it's very nice.  Right on the water and beautiful.  Clean showers and baths. Sites are smaller than I expected but there is so much waterfront to explore it didn't matter to us. Went with my 2 kids. Had a site ... My friends and I stayed 5 days here this past week and we loved it. Even though we were right by the highway we found it easy to tune out any noise coming from it. The beach was beautiful and we were able to watch some beautiful sunsets. ... Our site is right on the water. Amazing sound of the waves. Not a lot of privacy which we semi fixed with the set up of our trailer and truck. We are right in the middle of where the facilities are so we have the longest walk to the washrooms. Site 196. Nice spot for 1 or 2 days camping. Access to water is there but a regular beach is under 3 min drive away. 
Sunrise and sunset was amazing to watch if the day is clear. Don't expect a private campsite - this is not a wilderness park. Go for the waterfront. It's beautiful slate rock shelves stretching out into Georgian Bay. If you love being on or in the water, there's nothing better than this park. Great park to visit. Seems smaller than it is. Lots of beautiful shoreline to explore and beautiful sunrise and sunsets! Staff are friendly and courteous. Amenities are reasonably close by. Not all sites have much privacy though. Clean but pretty small. We came around 11 pm, so nobody wasn't here to sell some firewood, but it was bunch of bags left on the corner. We took one and paid in the morning. Thankful for that! Very nice campground.   Large pull through sites.  Staff very friendly. Definitely not a campground for an extended vacation, more suited to someone just stopping in for a night on route to somewhere else. The park is very small, the sites are tiny and although we thought our site in Area C was lacking in ... We had an excellent stay! Site #12 was perfect for us with a lovely water view. We'll definitely be back! Thank you! Went camping over the weekend. The camp site, especially the washrooms and showers, are clean and well maintained. The camp sites are close to each other and the privacy is minimal. No sand beach and the rocks make it hard to go inside the lake. Overall, it was a nice experience. This park is really small and its wedged literally between  the shore of Georgian Bay and Hwy 26.
Half the park has amazing tree sites the other half is almost treeless and some of the sites are ignorantly small.  
Still the views and seeming is amazing and kids can find fossilized bones very easily. If you are at blue mountains or wasaga beach, you must visit this place. I visited this place twice and loved to visit again and again. Best place for yoga too 😂 Beautiful view, staff were very accommodating and friendly. But the campsites are so small and close together our trailer barely fit on it. We pulled in and back out again and headed home. Very unfortunate. Great park! Camping is close to the road, but nice facilities. Beach is nice to cool off. The sound of the water at night was beautiful. Bring water shoes! There's oddly alot of roads here, we heard alot of traffic. The place could use more trees as well. Love how close it is to other fun things like the scenic caves Small camping site with big views and even friendlier people. This was our second time going to craigleith and this time my boyfriend and I just went by ourselves for an overnight trip. Site staff were very friendly when we had a concern ... Very beautiful camp ground! There isn't really a large beach and some trees are still small so not a lot of privacy between camp sites! Just a short 10 min drive to blue mountain village! Nice small park but close to a busy road We had a nice day trip here with family. Great view! Crystal clear water .. 3 stars due to the picnic tables placed right on the shoreline making the beach look very ugly! The views of Georgian Bay were hard to beat. Sunsets : take your breath away! The only downside was the description of our campsite. It was listed as full shade and this was inaccurate. Unless of course you consider 1 large Charlie Brown ... Amazing i would 100% come back here. Cute little beach, they have a shop on the campground that way if you forget small items they have them. Bathroom and showers are very clean which im happy to say. 
Not too far from any town for ... Nice facilities, very clean. Lack of beach and very busy highway made our stay less enjoyable. A place to pitch a tent and sleep if all other campgrounds are booked solid. Then you may want to consider a motel or hotel. Clean park with nicest swimming around. Water is super clean. Campground has a little noisy from highway traffic. Sites close to the slate beach is excellent.   The rest of the spots are  a touch crowded and lacking in foliage. Showers are excellent.  Location is close to the local beach and town. Sadly.. my favourite place on the planet was ruined by a wind storm knocking over several trees!! 😪 but what was worse was how they let every site have like 15 tents on it and felt over run with people..  looked like a makeshift homeless community. 😪😪 Stayed there for 3 days. Make sure to put parking permit on the car display board. This park's parking lot is a cash cow for the town of wasaga beach police. They will make no. of visits to this parking lot every day. Camp sites are cramped. Park is ok. We camped on site 12 very close to the water. This helped to mask other bothersome noise. There isn't much coverage or foliage between many sites but the park does offer a nice playground and field for kids. There isn't a beach but lots ... Was a bit disappointed at the campground.  The sites are small and crowded. Not a good spot for swimming. Very close to the highway. Very nice park. Clean and quiet.  Highly recommend Terrible park.
No where to park truck and trailer to check in.
Controlled entrance which is a pain.
Sites are small and roads are narrow.
Site was very dirty.
Rude and ignorant people everywhere.
We had booked 2 nights and left after 1.
Will never ever return. Beautiful location on Lake Huron. Unfortunately neighbors a highway. Not much privacy. Nice small park to go camping and fossil hunting. $15 parking inside or outside flat rate. Really fun place to pay for day use and Wade around looking at fossils in the bracing beautiful waters. The. Worst. Park. Ever.  Highway 26 traffic noise is ridiculous and offensive all the time except for about 3 in the morning.  You can SEE the vehicles on the highway, not just hear them.  Campsites?  What sites?  Reminiscent of a camp ... Went to there shale beach;place was awesome,but we are trying to keep it a secret. I really liked that i could wake up take 20 steps and be in the water. I did not like that there is very little tree coverage and the highway is very close to the campground you can hear vehicles going by. Favourite place for a swim. Very clear water. No real beach at this park but otherwise pretty good Pretty waterfront and friendly campers. Unfriendly kids working in the office.  Don't bring a trailer longer than 24' here unless you like driving it in the bush. Lots to do and see in the area . Staff were very friendly and easy going . Lucky us the weather was great as well . It was very small. Peaceful, but I probably won't be back, unless for a quick stop on my way to somewhere else. Love it, washrooms accesabale, drinking water taps available, direct acces to Lake, they run various nature programs. My boyfriend & i and our 2 dogs camped on site 20 which in our opinion was one of the nicest! It has a great view of georgian bay and its right across from the pet exercise area (smaller than what it looks like on the campsite map). The ... If you go here because its a Provincial Park, you will end up pretty upset. If you here to crash for a night, it's ok. There are no hiking / biking trails, no privacy, no water sport, right by hwy 26 which is very loud overnight. No bugs even in mid July. Showers are clean. We stayed at the campground and i cannot recommend it enough for its beauty.  One has tp expect a little noise from the road, but it is drowned out by the waves if you take a camping spot next to the water. The best park with the cleanest water you'll find! Worth the 2 hour drive!! It's cool to have a place with fossils so easily accessible. Very beautiful site, water view and amazing sunsets, excellent customer service, clean and very well maintained. Will return to this campsite for sure. It waz really small and there was no privacy. And the place reeked of weed. Great get away park.  Highway a little noisy but okay at night for sleeping No privacy anymore after the storm last year. Park wardens are also fairly strict as they usually are at Ontario parks. Good place to stay if you're looking to do downhill biking at Blue on a budget though. Would highly recommend for that. Quick 20 minute ride to the hill.  N8ce park on the water. Some sites have direct water for trailer nice bonus It was a beautiful campground.  Noisy though due to hwy 26 What a cozy park Good location but sites are very small. Views are awesome but it is very noisy since it is located besides the route.  I had reserved a waterfront site and when I arrived it was busy. The stuff was very nice and they tried their best but ... Good campsites, good privacy but noisy either from the nearby highway or from the lake waves Entire campground is placed on a thin stretch of land between the shoreline and the highway.  Three to four rows of campsites with little intermediate brush make for very little privacy on the side of the camp which allows radios.  The ... Worse provincial park i have ever seen. Lots are tiny and zero privacy.  Refused to stay. The staff were friendly and the water in the facilities was hot, but the positives end there. The campsites are wide open (virtually no trees to separate sites for privacy), it's is very close to a main road with frequent traffic noise, ... Ridiculously small sites. The highway noise is bothersome, especially at night when trucks go by Its extremely near the water. The water was so clean that you can see your feet clearly and the flat rocks going in a row. Camping is possible here and has a small play ground also. Shower and washrooms and a store to buy firewood and ... I had a great time there ;P Nkce place, enjoyed my time there, clean place This park maintains the same standards I have experienced at other provincial parks. The park is smaller then most, due to its location being between a major highways and Georgian Bay shoreline. The overall noise level of traffic is also ... The park is a thin slice on the shore of Georgian Bay, with a beautiful easily accessible flat shale rock coast. We found it a great spot to sit and watch the sunrise, but it would also be a great spot to launch a canoe or kayak. Great park right on Georgian Bay. Like, our camp site was like 10 meters from the shore with clear views of the water. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the park was clean, and sites were a good size. 

The sites weren't very ... Nice little park, too close to main road (highway) My partner and I are huge provincial park fans and camp as often as we can, but Craigleith is hard to love. Easy to like, but it's definitely hard to love. 

While we had a beautiful site (155) right on the water, there is no privacy as ... We stopped by just to see how it is, well it is not for us. Too close to the road(highway), too close to your neighbor. But you are really close to the water. Awful place to camp.  The grounds lack alot of trees so you literally can see the entire park, meaning there is zero site privacy.  It also is right along a main highway so it is super loud with trucks all night,  don't expect to sleep. ... Visited 2 days after early spring opening, and with cool windy weather, we had some privacy.  Scored a parking spot down at the water, and the roar of the waves drowned out the noise of the highway traffic. The tree survival rate is ... GREAT camping experience with wonderful staff. No shade at campsite and lots of noise from nearby hwy 26. Nice camping area, not a great beach very stones. The ranger was very helpful. Great area to be if you wish to experience the Colingwood area Windy and stoney  ground, the beach breeze was to strong to go boating.  Maybe just wrong timing as this was almost fall season. We camp here for the location as it is fairly close to Wasaga Beach and Blue Mountain trails. It is not like the ""in town"" private camps, which I preferred when I was ""younger""
I generally prefer provincial parks because I know I will ... It is an Ok park if you do not want to travel far, the sites are small and no privacy. The beach...well I wouldn't call it a beach...too many rocks.. Great location on the water. Park staff are excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Washrooms and showers are clean. Park is located on a busy highway so there is road noise, but most of the time during our stay the sound was muffled by ... I wouldn't want to camp there. The camp ground was very open. Not much foliage of any kind to separate the sites from one another. The sites were small and not well defined. We drove around the entire campground and this was the case ... 2 stars for being right on Georgian Bay and staff were friendly. Loss of stars for the fact that the sites are extremely open (they do explain this on their website)and the washrooms and basic upkeep were less than OK. Good for a one night pit stop as well as to see the sunset on the bay. Beautiful views from beach front campsites. Some sites seemed small, but ours (site 9) was perfect for our three tents (one large and two small). At times the highway is audible, but is generally overpowered by the relaxing waves. Not a lot of privacy but on the lake Excellent place! The rocks were very neat! Just be careful not to slip and fall while swimming, because the rocks tend to sometimes be rather slippery... It's very close to Blue Mountain where we had an event to go to. That was the only reason we went there and probably the only reason we will go back to it again. Not the usual Provincial park feel. Sites are nice, but, too close to the road to my liking If you don't mind to sleep with loud noise from Highway 26, or sounds of Georgian Bay,   it is still a good place to visit and camp. Great spot to stop for a few hours. You can find tons of fossils in the shale and the rock ""tiers"" are a warm spot to sun yourself by the shoreline. A small but beautiful park. It is especially nice during the fall season with the Georgian Bay waters providing a symphony of tranquility to go with the picturesque skies and scenery. One of my favourite parks. Camping by the water.   Very carefully maintained campground.   Great employees Peaceful and very well maintained not bad Went to visit while we were staying at a 4 star RV site on the mountain West of Meaford. Well what can I say. There no way I could fit 59 feet in any of the spots. Sites to the north would be unreal water front if they would cut the ... Great park. On the highway so you hear traffic, but quiet otherwise. Lovely small park. The sites are small with minimal privacy. Staff are lovely.  One of the best campsites I have been to. Pitch 5 is recommended. Beautiful natural place Great park close to so many activities only downside is traffic noise One of the worst provincial parks I've been to. And I'm a big fan of the provincial parks in general. It's narrow as hell, so you can't escape the noise of the highway that's RIGHT BESIDE IT. The campsites are way too close, with not ... Nice little park. Very nice camping. A bit noisy due to the proximity to provincial road 26. Bit the views of the Georgian Bay more than make up for it!  Busy, dusty, not much maintenance. nice park with clean bathrooms and showers. obviously the noise from the highway is there and loud when a truck passes, but we found that to be comforting because we are from the city lol. traveled with a 7 month old and she was able to ... It has nice beach but camp ground is smaller than other provincial parks and privacy is worse than other parks. also  it is too close to local road and lots of noise from it. Good place for swimming for kinds and adults. 
It has ""flat rock"" shore which gradually goes to water without sudden deep holes. Water warms up very well and water is quite clear. 
Good for snorkeling and diving training.  
The bad thing, - it is next to highway 26. Noisy. A nice small park to take the kids and discover fossils embedded in shale. Great place for romantic getaway.
It's better if you visit during summer time.
Always best to have heater if going during cold season.
Try to get a place with electricity. I'm not going to complain about the fact this location is right next to a busy highway.  But this is the worse camping site I've ever been.  

If you are going to this site for a day trip; that's fine.  Anything longer, find a hotel.

1. ... The park has amazing lake access and is absolutely wonderful for swimmers. However, the park is located right next to a very busy highway and the noise is endless. The security guards wear bulletproof vests and patrol around like they ... Awsome place for camping and picnic. AMAZING VIEWS, but really tight quarters, you can here people talking in the next site as there is no privacy.  We stayed here on the May long weekend. Park staff were great help and very friendly . Park is a small park but very nice. We stayed on a waterfront campsite it was a beautiful view however it was very very windy .. They do warn you ... Awesome campsite We are just back from 2 nights camping. Beautiful place. Lots of fossils. The gentleman at the store/office was super and so all the stuff. very clean and well maintained sites. Ours had the lake view.  Horrible experience.  The campsites are very close together and no privacy. Be prepared to be harassed by some of the park ""security"". Our group was 3 guys who stayed the weekend to go mtn biking. We were quiet and kept to ourselves. The ... The crash of the water on the famous shale shore successfully drowned out the highway most of the night. The ground was hard - bring sleeping pads or foam is my advice. The campsite was a decent size, the store nearby was well stocked ... Crowded, Too close to the highway.
 but the view is beatiful and the lake is right there. Been camping 20 years and this park is worse than oastler provincial park ( which has a train running near it.) I did not end up staying here because there was absolutely no trees or brush to speak of in half the park (due to a storm in ... Great facilities, helpful staff. And sooooo beautiful. Great location (central). Nice clean park. Many of the sites are not very private. Great swimming. Good views for sunsets. Ablution building could have been kept cleaner.  Worst park in Ontario I've never ever been more heartbroken by the state of this campground good view ,beautiful water but noisy Beach area is great during day, but camping over night the road traffic is very loud. Close to the highway but overall a nice park. Close to activities at Blue Mountain.  The rocky shale beach and the playground kept my 10 year old son happy. Heaven on earth A fossil in every rock on the beach, great staff and nice spots on the water with 2 way hookups and open till the extreme of the season!  Go there most years.
John and Diane. A smaller provincial park, but nice that it's right next to the water. Great place to have lunch on a sunny day. Awesome camping. Warden friendly. Great place for camping Amazing site Park rangers are to sensitive about every little thing. We were talking at night, no music, no loud screaming, not using any tools, not making a noise, but they came up to us several times and told us to be quiet when we were TALKING and ... This was a nice campground with good facilities and awesome water access. Very beautiful there and had a wonderful night. Camp was a little expensive, but that was the only downside.  A park is a park! Close to the highway, you can hear it all night, and my friend could even hear it on the beach, although the waves seemed to drown out the sound for me. The flat rock beach is pretty, but rocky and slippery, bring water ... My family and i went for a whole week. Thats how amazing the Campground was. Although we did have our campsite near the highway we barely heard any noise, only during the day. If you are a deep sleeper then you won't be able to hear the ... Good place# Wonderful dog walking in the winter campsites adjacent to the water are amazing. facilities great. busy-ish highway north of park is quite loud.  Small but sites with some great waterfront views. Some road noise in some locations. Well maintained.  Sites are too close to the highway and each other. No activities within walking distance. Good place to camp or bring a trailer Camping # 102: Lots of road noise and odors from toilets septic tank. No intimacy, one or two trees per camping lot. Right at the water! crowded, not much privacy,  washroom is not good, road noises. but close to blue mountain. The park is really close to the highway and campsites are small with low privacy. Location is great and washrooms/showers are very clean. Beach is alright, water is a bit cold in Aug. Great time last visit.  Very windy.  Bring extra tie downs for tents.  Just in case you get s shallow location.   Location is great and has the added plus of not being one of those tacky private sites in Wasaga which are basically open fields.  BUT, the sites have zero privacy.  Even the ones rated with average privacy have zero privacy.  At least ... Wide sites. Park staff are very rude the park ranger was queer ask me to leave cuz I wasn't registered meanwhile call me a cab Ace Cabs wouldn't take me home so they called the police Ace cabinets another company I will never ever do with again things have changed since Paul spensley sold it Great place for camping and the beach is beautiful. Wow! All I can say is wow. Ontario is covered with beautiful provincial parks. This is NOT one of them. I usually take Google reviews with a grain of salt. The negative ones were bang on. I'm shocked. 

We stayed here July long weekend ... great camping on lake Huron not so good for little ones when lake is ruff but amazing for swimmers We come back every year with our entire family. Love the rocky beach here. From our camp site we could hear the waves crashing on the shore all night! A very small park with cramped camp sites and only a single parking lot outside the park (you could still bring a single car inside). No trails or anything but beautiful beaches (not good for swimming) and very close to Blue Mountain. Paid parking. Too costly. The worst camp grounds I've ever been to. The traffic is NON-STOP! It goes on all day & all night. Not even a rainfall drowns out the sound of it. Just horrible, I left feeling more stressed then when I arrived after only two out of five nights. I will NEVER come back!! Beautiful right on Georgian bay  You'd think being right beside the highway would detract from the bay view and nature feel but it's well treed and all of the sites are reasonably close to the water so you don't feel like you're beside a highway. A bit surprised how much the parking cost for us to visit friends who were staying there though...  Nice place. Sort of busy but fun. View is beautiful but park is right on the highway. Never camped here but I amazing the highway noise would be annoying all night Absolutely stunning place! Best place every  summer go there Amazing for fossil hunting!! SAVE your family mate - don't come here!!! The park is right next to the busy and noisy hwy 26 - if u r looking for piece and quiet I suggest you bring ear plugs or drink yourself into oblivion every night. And don't bother using their ... Beautiful a d peaceful place First time camping and we had an awesome time  The view of the falls is spectacular! Nice site very close to the water Nice place to overnight camp for day tripping Nice for children and adults camping Amazing swimming here.  Magic Place to visit Really big potato The price of admission doesn't justify the beach. If you do end up going, keep in mind that the beaches are rocky beaches - bring water shoes.  A fossil gold mine in the shale next to the water  Nice views and  quiet Natural beauty  The cable cars are exciting Beautifull spot Not privacy at all Excellent Park Good place  Gorgeous.  Disappointing (Translated by Google) ❤❤❤❤ Real favorite. Very small, quiet campground with location directly on the edge of Goergienne Bay.

❤❤❤❤ Véritable coup de coeur. Tout petit terrain de camping tranquille avec emplacement directement sur le bord de la baie Goergienne. (Translated by Google) The lake is beautiful, had the impression of being on the edge of the ocean with its waves however the highway passes nearby.

Magnifique endroit pour la nature. (Translated by Google) Not enough wild, very near Highway 28. But beautiful place, water is impeccable, transparent and not too cold.

Its guuud","Located on the southern shore of Georgian Bay
Fractured plates of shale that form our shoreline contain fossils that are 450 million years old
Flat rock is ideal for launching a sailboat, kayak/canoe, paddle board, wind surfing, fishing or watching a spectacular sunset
Located at the Base of Blue Mountain we are an ideal hub to enjoy what the local area has to offer. Hike the Bruce Trail, bike the Georgian Trail, visit the Blue Mountain Village or use your vehicle permit to gain free access to Wasaga Beach Provincial Park (the longest freshwater beach in the world)
Camping experience for everyone: RVs or tents
Host your next family function while overlooking Georgian Bay at our Picnic Shelter; call the park office to reserve.What an amazing park. Don't know where to start staff was awesome. Bathrooms where so clean. Loved the swimming. The other campers where so friendly.  Definitely going back next season. The best part about the park is access to the lake. It's beautiful and shallow. Lovely place for families. We were camping close to the highway and it was loud. If you can't get a spot right on the lake, don't go. Those spots are quieter. I give the camp ground a 5, it's very nice.  Right on the water and beautiful.  Clean showers and baths. Sites are smaller than I expected but there is so much waterfront to explore it didn't matter to us. Went with my 2 kids. Had a site ... My friends and I stayed 5 days here this past week and we loved it. Even though we were right by the highway we found it easy to tune out any noise coming from it. The beach was beautiful and we were able to watch some beautiful sunsets. ... Our site is right on the water. Amazing sound of the waves. Not a lot of privacy which we semi fixed with the set up of our trailer and truck. We are right in the middle of where the facilities are so we have the longest walk to the washrooms. Site 196. Nice spot for 1 or 2 days camping. Access to water is there but a regular beach is under 3 min drive away. 
Sunrise and sunset was amazing to watch if the day is clear. Don't expect a private campsite - this is not a wilderness park. Go for the waterfront. It's beautiful slate rock shelves stretching out into Georgian Bay. If you love being on or in the water, there's nothing better than this park. Great park to visit. Seems smaller than it is. Lots of beautiful shoreline to explore and beautiful sunrise and sunsets! Staff are friendly and courteous. Amenities are reasonably close by. Not all sites have much privacy though. Clean but pretty small. We came around 11 pm, so nobody wasn't here to sell some firewood, but it was bunch of bags left on the corner. We took one and paid in the morning. Thankful for that! Very nice campground.   Large pull through sites.  Staff very friendly. Definitely not a campground for an extended vacation, more suited to someone just stopping in for a night on route to somewhere else. The park is very small, the sites are tiny and although we thought our site in Area C was lacking in ... We had an excellent stay! Site #12 was perfect for us with a lovely water view. We'll definitely be back! Thank you! Went camping over the weekend. The camp site, especially the washrooms and showers, are clean and well maintained. The camp sites are close to each other and the privacy is minimal. No sand beach and the rocks make it hard to go inside the lake. Overall, it was a nice experience. This park is really small and its wedged literally between  the shore of Georgian Bay and Hwy 26.
Half the park has amazing tree sites the other half is almost treeless and some of the sites are ignorantly small.  
Still the views and seeming is amazing and kids can find fossilized bones very easily. If you are at blue mountains or wasaga beach, you must visit this place. I visited this place twice and loved to visit again and again. Best place for yoga too 😂 Beautiful view, staff were very accommodating and friendly. But the campsites are so small and close together our trailer barely fit on it. We pulled in and back out again and headed home. Very unfortunate. Great park! Camping is close to the road, but nice facilities. Beach is nice to cool off. The sound of the water at night was beautiful. Bring water shoes! There's oddly alot of roads here, we heard alot of traffic. The place could use more trees as well. Love how close it is to other fun things like the scenic caves Small camping site with big views and even friendlier people. This was our second time going to craigleith and this time my boyfriend and I just went by ourselves for an overnight trip. Site staff were very friendly when we had a concern ... Very beautiful camp ground! There isn't really a large beach and some trees are still small so not a lot of privacy between camp sites! Just a short 10 min drive to blue mountain village! Nice small park but close to a busy road We had a nice day trip here with family. Great view! Crystal clear water .. 3 stars due to the picnic tables placed right on the shoreline making the beach look very ugly! The views of Georgian Bay were hard to beat. Sunsets : take your breath away! The only downside was the description of our campsite. It was listed as full shade and this was inaccurate. Unless of course you consider 1 large Charlie Brown ... Amazing i would 100% come back here. Cute little beach, they have a shop on the campground that way if you forget small items they have them. Bathroom and showers are very clean which im happy to say.

The sites weren't very ... Nice little park, too close to main road (highway) My partner and I are huge provincial park fans and camp as often as we can, but Craigleith is hard to love. Easy to like, but it's definitely hard to love. 

While we had a beautiful site (155) right on the water, there is no privacy as ... We stopped by just to see how it is, well it is not for us. Too close to the road(highway), too close to your neighbor. But you are really close to the water. Awful place to camp.  The grounds lack alot of trees so you literally can see the entire park, meaning there is zero site privacy.  It also is right along a main highway so it is super loud with trucks all night,  don't expect to sleep. ... Visited 2 days after early spring opening, and with cool windy weather, we had some privacy.  Scored a parking spot down at the water, and the roar of the waves drowned out the noise of the highway traffic. The tree survival rate is ... GREAT camping experience with wonderful staff. No shade at campsite and lots of noise from nearby hwy 26. Nice camping area, not a great beach very stones. The ranger was very helpful. Great area to be if you wish to experience the Colingwood area Windy and stoney  ground, the beach breeze was to strong to go boating.  Maybe just wrong timing as this was almost fall season. We camp here for the location as it is fairly close to Wasaga Beach and Blue Mountain trails. It is not like the ""in town"" private camps, which I preferred when I was ""younger""
I generally prefer provincial parks because I know I will ... It is an Ok park if you do not want to travel far, the sites are small and no privacy. The beach...well I wouldn't call it a beach...too many rocks.. Great location on the water. Park staff are excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Washrooms and showers are clean. Park is located on a busy highway so there is road noise, but most of the time during our stay the sound was muffled by ... I wouldn't want to camp there. The camp ground was very open. Not much foliage of any kind to separate the sites from one another. The sites were small and not well defined. We drove around the entire campground and this was the case ... 2 stars for being right on Georgian Bay and staff were friendly. Loss of stars for the fact that the sites are extremely open (they do explain this on their website)and the washrooms and basic upkeep were less than OK. Good for a one night pit stop as well as to see the sunset on the bay. Beautiful views from beach front campsites. Some sites seemed small, but ours (site 9) was perfect for our three tents (one large and two small). At times the highway is audible, but is generally overpowered by the relaxing waves. Not a lot of privacy but on the lake Excellent place! The rocks were very neat! Just be careful not to slip and fall while swimming, because the rocks tend to sometimes be rather slippery... It's very close to Blue Mountain where we had an event to go to. That was the only reason we went there and probably the only reason we will go back to it again. Not the usual Provincial park feel. Sites are nice, but, too close to the road to my liking If you don't mind to sleep with loud noise from Highway 26, or sounds of Georgian Bay,   it is still a good place to visit and camp. Great spot to stop for a few hours. You can find tons of fossils in the shale and the rock ""tiers"" are a warm spot to sun yourself by the shoreline. A small but beautiful park. It is especially nice during the fall season with the Georgian Bay waters providing a symphony of tranquility to go with the picturesque skies and scenery. One of my favourite parks. Camping by the water.   Very carefully maintained campground.   Great employees Peaceful and very well maintained not bad Went to visit while we were staying at a 4 star RV site on the mountain West of Meaford. Well what can I say. There no way I could fit 59 feet in any of the spots. Sites to the north would be unreal water front if they would cut the ... Great park. On the highway so you hear traffic, but quiet otherwise. Lovely small park. The sites are small with minimal privacy. Staff are lovely.  One of the best campsites I have been to. Pitch 5 is recommended. Beautiful natural place Great park close to so many activities only downside is traffic noise One of the worst provincial parks I've been to. And I'm a big fan of the provincial parks in general. It's narrow as hell, so you can't escape the noise of the highway that's RIGHT BESIDE IT. The campsites are way too close, with not ... Nice little park. Very nice camping. A bit noisy due to the proximity to provincial road 26. Bit the views of the Georgian Bay more than make up for it!  Busy, dusty, not much maintenance. nice park with clean bathrooms and showers. obviously the noise from the highway is there and loud when a truck passes, but we found that to be comforting because we are from the city lol. traveled with a 7 month old and she was able to ... It has nice beach but camp ground is smaller than other provincial parks and privacy is worse than other parks. also  it is too close to local road and lots of noise from it. Good place for swimming for kinds and adults. 
It has ""flat rock"" shore which gradually goes to water without sudden deep holes. Water warms up very well and water is quite clear. 
Good for snorkeling and diving training.  
The bad thing, - it is next to highway 26. Noisy. A nice small park to take the kids and discover fossils embedded in shale. Great place for romantic getaway.
It's better if you visit during summer time.
Always best to have heater if going during cold season.
Try to get a place with electricity. I'm not going to complain about the fact this location is right next to a busy highway.  But this is the worse camping site I've ever been.  

If you are going to this site for a day trip; that's fine.  Anything longer, find a hotel.

1. ... The park has amazing lake access and is absolutely wonderful for swimmers. However, the park is located right next to a very busy highway and the noise is endless. The security guards wear bulletproof vests and patrol around like they ... Awsome place for camping and picnic. AMAZING VIEWS, but really tight quarters, you can here people talking in the next site as there is no privacy.  We stayed here on the May long weekend. Park staff were great help and very friendly . Park is a small park but very nice. We stayed on a waterfront campsite it was a beautiful view however it was very very windy .. They do warn you ... Awesome campsite We are just back from 2 nights camping. Beautiful place. Lots of fossils. The gentleman at the store/office was super and so all the stuff. very clean and well maintained sites. Ours had the lake view.  Horrible experience.  The campsites are very close together and no privacy. Be prepared to be harassed by some of the park ""security"". Our group was 3 guys who stayed the weekend to go mtn biking. We were quiet and kept to ourselves. The ... The crash of the water on the famous shale shore successfully drowned out the highway most of the night. The ground was hard - bring sleeping pads or foam is my advice. The campsite was a decent size, the store nearby was well stocked ... Crowded, Too close to the highway.
 but the view is beatiful and the lake is right there. Been camping 20 years and this park is worse than oastler provincial park ( which has a train running near it.) I did not end up staying here because there was absolutely no trees or brush to speak of in half the park (due to a storm in ... Great facilities, helpful staff. And sooooo beautiful. Great location (central). Nice clean park. Many of the sites are not very private. Great swimming. Good views for sunsets. Ablution building could have been kept cleaner.  Worst park in Ontario I've never ever been more heartbroken by the state of this campground good view ,beautiful water but noisy Beach area is great during day, but camping over night the road traffic is very loud. Close to the highway but overall a nice park. Close to activities at Blue Mountain.  The rocky shale beach and the playground kept my 10 year old son happy. Heaven on earth A fossil in every rock on the beach, great staff and nice spots on the water with 2 way hookups and open till the extreme of the season!  Go there most years.
John and Diane. A smaller provincial park, but nice that it's right next to the water. Great place to have lunch on a sunny day. Awesome camping. Warden friendly. Great place for camping Amazing site Park rangers are to sensitive about every little thing. We were talking at night, no music, no loud screaming, not using any tools, not making a noise, but they came up to us several times and told us to be quiet when we were TALKING and ... This was a nice campground with good facilities and awesome water access. Very beautiful there and had a wonderful night. Camp was a little expensive, but that was the only downside.  A park is a park! Close to the highway, you can hear it all night, and my friend could even hear it on the beach, although the waves seemed to drown out the sound for me. The flat rock beach is pretty, but rocky and slippery, bring water ... My family and i went for a whole week. Thats how amazing the Campground was. Although we did have our campsite near the highway we barely heard any noise, only during the day. If you are a deep sleeper then you won't be able to hear the ... Good place# Wonderful dog walking in the winter campsites adjacent to the water are amazing. facilities great. busy-ish highway north of park is quite loud.  Small but sites with some great waterfront views. Some road noise in some locations. Well maintained.  Sites are too close to the highway and each other. No activities within walking distance. Good place to camp or bring a trailer Camping # 102: Lots of road noise and odors from toilets septic tank. No intimacy, one or two trees per camping lot. Right at the water! crowded, not much privacy,  washroom is not good, road noises. but close to blue mountain. The park is really close to the highway and campsites are small with low privacy. Location is great and washrooms/showers are very clean. Beach is alright, water is a bit cold in Aug. Great time last visit.  Very windy.  Bring extra tie downs for tents.  Just in case you get s shallow location.   Location is great and has the added plus of not being one of those tacky private sites in Wasaga which are basically open fields.  BUT, the sites have zero privacy.  Even the ones rated with average privacy have zero privacy.  At least ... Wide sites. Park staff are very rude the park ranger was queer ask me to leave cuz I wasn't registered meanwhile call me a cab Ace Cabs wouldn't take me home so they called the police Ace cabinets another company I will never ever do with again things have changed since Paul spensley sold it Great place for camping and the beach is beautiful. Wow! All I can say is wow. Ontario is covered with beautiful provincial parks. This is NOT one of them. I usually take Google reviews with a grain of salt. The negative ones were bang on. I'm shocked. 

We stayed here July long weekend ... great camping on lake Huron not so good for little ones when lake is ruff but amazing for swimmers We come back every year with our entire family. Love the rocky beach here. From our camp site we could hear the waves crashing on the shore all night! A very small park with cramped camp sites and only a single parking lot outside the park (you could still bring a single car inside). No trails or anything but beautiful beaches (not good for swimming) and very close to Blue Mountain. Paid parking. Too costly. The worst camp grounds I've ever been to. The traffic is NON-STOP! It goes on all day & all night. Not even a rainfall drowns out the sound of it. Just horrible, I left feeling more stressed then when I arrived after only two out of five nights. I will NEVER come back!! Beautiful right on Georgian bay  You'd think being right beside the highway would detract from the bay view and nature feel but it's well treed and all of the sites are reasonably close to the water so you don't feel like you're beside a highway. A bit surprised how much the parking cost for us to visit friends who were staying there though...  Nice place. Sort of busy but fun. View is beautiful but park is right on the highway. Never camped here but I amazing the highway noise would be annoying all night Absolutely stunning place! Best place every  summer go there Amazing for fossil hunting!! SAVE your family mate - don't come here!!! The park is right next to the busy and noisy hwy 26 - if u r looking for piece and quiet I suggest you bring ear plugs or drink yourself into oblivion every night. And don't bother using their ... Beautiful a d peaceful place First time camping and we had an awesome time  The view of the falls is spectacular! Nice site very close to the water Nice place to overnight camp for day tripping Nice for children and adults camping Amazing swimming here.  Magic Place to visit Really big potato The price of admission doesn't justify the beach. If you do end up going, keep in mind that the beaches are rocky beaches - bring water shoes.  A fossil gold mine in the shale next to the water  Nice views and  quiet Natural beauty  The cable cars are exciting Beautifull spot Not privacy at all Excellent Park Good place  Gorgeous.  Disappointing (Translated by Google) ❤❤❤❤ Real favorite. Very small, quiet campground with location directly on the edge of Goergienne Bay.

The park is well kept, washrooms and showers were clean. We loved how close to the water we could be at short notice. Love the radio free area so not to have to deal with partiers. Will definitely be back. First time visiting park. Spent 2 hours walking various trails and roads admiring birds and squirrels, plus taking in beautiful views of Lake Ontario. Picture shown is from shores of Lake Ontario overlooking McLaughlin Bay at sunset. Definitely worth a visit! Not a bad park. Staff are friendly and helpful. Washrooms are well maintained and store has great ice cream. Sites are a good size too. Improvements that could be made;
Some sites are not private at all. Our site had a water tap in the ... Darlington was a great experience but for a campground, I can't say it was as enjoyable as a place like Presquile or Algonquin. The main issue is how close it is to the train tracks. I live nearby a train line, so I was used to it but ... Camping was fun! Great first time experience for me. Campsite was clean. Huge too. Public washrooms were decent at the beginning, but as time went by, you'd expect them to be maintained - but nope! Overall the beach there is good. Clean. ... First time camping with my family.  Park is nice, entrance is where you get registered and receive a map to the site you have paid for.  You pass by the convenient store before you get to the sites.  Fairly priced logs at $7 a bag, they ... Hard to rate since the park was only partially open. The trails were easy and the day use area looks really nice Took my 3yo on his first overnight camping trip here. Wanted to stay local in case we had to bail out early. We had a blast! Great camp sites and super clean park. We will be back next season! Be sure to stop at the Ranger office and purchase day pass even though the park is closed. They will watch you hang out and drive around and when you leave your car, they ticket you. No warnings at all. We didnt realize once park closes for the season, we still needed a permit. Expensive walk, but nice just the same. Second time at this camp ground. Cool breeze coming off the lake even in the heat wave. Best thing about there is no raccoons. Can play your music pretty much all night (not loud of course) alcohol is allowed. The park rangers are genuinely nice people,very friendly and willing to help. 41.50 to camp near a lake view minutes out of Oshawa.

A slightly hilly area featuring several moderately flat hectares of camping, this Ontario Provincial Park features two hundred and something sites, some with electricity and all with ... Great little park close to the city. Not much good swimming tho. We were pleasantly surprised to be able to book this campsite the same week. The park is well kept, washrooms and showers were clean. We loved how close to the water we could be at short notice. Love the radio free area so not to have to deal with partiers. Will definitely be back. Perfect place to take your kids on their first camping trip.  I just wish there were more fun activities for kids. Couldn't believe there was such a nice little park so close to where we live.  Quaint, small but big enough. And obviously enjoyed by plenty of people.  Sites are well big enough, was quiet, and we enjoyed our stay.  Would not call it our favourite but we will definitely go back without a hesitation. $33 to park my truck on the site on top of the camp site fee. Put my pass on the post and my dash as stated. Wake up to a ticket that was issued at 3 am - ""not displaying pass on my dash"". Very strange as it was there when I woke up. ... Clean, calm. Water was warmish & crystal clear. The shore is rocky & entry into water was rocky 2 meters. Then sand. Water drops off quickly. Couldn't have asked for a better day. Nice small park close to Lake Ontario, with camping facilities.  Great for summer fun. Awesome beach, fishing training was free  for kids and small park. it's nice for everyone specially families..got sand too for kids like mine need sand to play Love it. Been camping there two years in a row. Great for kids and large groups and families, and couples alike.  Beach is near by with picnic area.  All around relaxing. A great place to excape the extreme city heatwave. I would recommend this park. It has trails to hike, fish to catch and lots of areas to camp. The staff is extremely informative and friendly. Excellent location for visiting TO and surrounding areas.
All the facilities showers, water and electricity.

When we arrived after booking on line our spot was taken #34 and My Hubby is handicapped and we needed that closeness to the ... Really nice park as far as PPs go. Most sites are BIG. Beach is mostly small stone and not nice to walk on barefoot. A lot of trains pass close by but you get used to it. In a trailer anyway. Probably louder if in a tent. Daily events for children and a nice play area. Store with basics. Overall a nice place. Love this park, great for small or large gatherings, camping, there's a lake also so you just follow the trails that will lead you there. Be with nature for a while.. We've been having our Annual picnic there for over 30+ years. Awesome campsites close to home. The only downside is the proximity to the highway, train tracks and the level crossing (train horns). Excellent beach and hiking areas. The place is wonderful, we were wondering why nobody's mentioned it before... Until we eared the train whistle... Multiple time... During the night!!! Nice shaded, private sites. Beach is very rocky. Building sand sculptures is out. Need to walk about 3 meters/9 feet into the water before reaching sand. Recommend water shoes. Loved that we could bbq near a bench and ate our food then sat by the beach side. The waves are pretty high in this beach compared to sauble beach. Water I'd also a little milky grey color. It is definitely a family beach. The downside ... We were on site 226. Adequate privacy as the site is surrounded by trees and brush. One side of the campsite has a trail along side it and you see everybody who walks along it through the bushes. The site is rated for 30' trailers but ... Had a great time, walked to the beach and saw the pioneer cemetery. 

Our dog loved his first time camping and we will definitely be back. Very secured place to camp. Ontario Parks and OPP surveillance. Neatly maintained camp ground and most of the camp sites are shady all day.. :)  the beach is full of moss on the shores and untidy.. but the waves are the best.. we can have fun and the day camping site isgood too. Constant trains all night long made it difficult to sleep. Site 311 was good for hammock camping.  The staff did a good job of policing the park. Nice camping lots. Washrooms aren't the greatest and shower water was always cold. Staff was nice and welcoming. Told the staff my firepit was full and they came to take care of it.
If you're used to more quiet camping/hearing the ... Staff need to clean the washrooms and the shower almost 1 or 2 hours. Showers were so dirty with tissues and other dirty stuff. But none one came to clean until 6 or 7 pm. 
Then Sunday night to Monday around 10am. Nothing were cleaned. ... Nice and close to home.
Nice walking paths, waterfront, and some easy hiking close by. 
Only downfall to this park is train passing occasionally. Absolutely do not recommend. We left the kids with the grandparents for the weekend and drove two hours to camp with three friends. The gate staff were really friendly but the rangers were AWFUL. They harassed us on our site, on the ... Great beach and also amazing views. Good spot for picnic and camping Staff are incredibly rude.  Security is way to overzealous.  Harassing families with children.  Definitely don't treat you like a paying customer.  Would never go here again My visit was in late June.
The day park is okay and the staff are great people but some of them need to grow some balls. They have to manage the use of the picnic benches better and stop allowing 6 people to have 4 tables. One to sit on ... Nice park. Large sites. Well maintained. Noise of the 401 hwy is the only negative. A nice park but washrooms are so far from our picnic area and should be a bit more central. Beautiful place, nice beach but noisy for camping. The camp grounds are very close to railway and you hear the noise of trains and horn almost every 10 minutes during the night. Great place to bring my dog Had a lovely Sunday walk with my family and our dogs. Beautiful views.  Lots of comfort stations and washrooms.  But very noisy with the train horning every 10mins... It's unreal.  Don't camp here if you prefer quietness. great spot to camp for a few days Nice place but the train runs right beside the park. It goes by several times during the day and several times at night and blows a very loud whistle. Very hard to sleep this way. Average campground. Convenient amenities. Lots of things to do for kids. Not so much for adults. Beach was kind of messy. Ok for families, but don't bother bringing a group of friends. Great open park but you have to pay $15 to get in which is understandable considering the amount of work they put into the park to make it great. We went for camping for a night .Had an amazing experience. Clean washrooms and very secure place to go with your family. Quite enjoyable place, when the weather is warm! It's an ok park. Dont expect your typical provincial park out in the wilderness. The highway is loud and trains go by all the time blowing there whistle. The beach is ok for rock collecting. Not good for laying on the beach or swimming. I was there first week in September. It may be different earlier in the summer Got a day pass to go to the beach and we could hardly walk down to the water because of all the rocks jabbing into our feet. Water gets deep very quickly, not good for small children. Over all disappointed and wont be going back. Worst camping trip! 
Firstly, when you come in to register they will charge you $15 per night for any additional vehicles on site & as the staff will not inform you about it as to how many your allowed to have on your site & will charge ... Excellent camping, wonderful workers, it's heaven on Earth, it's the only place to go The site was great..very quiet.  My only problem was the biting ants..they were a nightmare but I still gave 4 stars because it's not the parks fault.  Bring lots of big spray We were camping ng here for the first time. Not the first camping trip though. Not the best experience. Don’t get me wrong , campsites are clean and spacious,lake is not to far walk. My only problem was that I could hear highway and ... It was the worst park that we ever went to. The ranger there are so rude and racist. They started to harass us about other people’s garbage, that we weren’t even near to but, like the good samaritans we are, we picked it up anyways. He ... Nice park. Beautiful views of Lake Ontario. Lovely beach. Perhaps too rocky not enough sand. Water is not so clean either. Staff are helpful and very nice.  I will be returning. Very small park. Skinny broken trees.. no privacy.. dirty washrooms& shower. Especially washroom cleaning time is way longer than other provincial parks. I dont know what staffs do in the washroom during cleaning time. Had to wait more than 20mins whenever they clean the washroom. We were picking apples which were wasted in the ground and the security guy came and behaved like a racist charged us and threatened to fine. Very rude behavior. Worst provincial park ever. If I could, I would give 0 stars. The water was thick and green with algae, beach was rocky and dirty, and the washrooms were so desgusiting my 2 year old refused to use them. Not worth the $14.50 for a day pass. It is worth the drive to...anywhere else. Love this place. Its great if your looking to enjoy some quite time. But I do think they should add some more things there for kids. I like it here. Nature to. We go for hikes. One of the loveliest parks for the day use. Highly recommended. This is a beautiful Provincial Park located on the shores of lake ontario. The unfortunate thing about this park is it proximity to both the 401 and the main train line that runs between Toronto and Montreal. From our campsite, we had no ... It is a nice park not too far from Toronto. It is by lake ontario not so great for swimming since it is lake ontario however it is covenient for those who do not want to travel far and enjoy one or two nights of camping. Loved it ❤ I had the campsite right next to the lake and it was so nice! It's only an hour away from Toronto. It is good place for camping!! But not quite though..you can hear train horn in midnight..wash rooms are o.k. not to expect cleanlines. Very clean and well managed. There is a nice variety of fauna and flora. It's easy to forget you're close to the 401 and the city of Oshawa. Great place visit if you are looking for a natural environment that is in close proximity to Oshawa/Clarington. Good camp site's. Security is annoying, pick on the wrong people. No radios.... but the Train runs all night and day? Always so fun and so peaceful.  You definitely need to go and camp there at least a few nights Best place to visit with family soacially picnic aeria 4 Camping with the kids was great.  Train was a little loud, but good overall. Great place they just need to keep the bathrooms clean. Nice beach and campground area. Decent campsites. Didn't get a chance to hike the trails. Didn't appreciate staff and OPP circling campsites hourly. They were not being helpful, but trying to lay fines for park infractions. I would ... Excellent location must visit in summer Good park good sized camping sites. Had to pay for entry which was $14, not worth it. No proper place to sit but otherwise the view was amazing Great park for a day trip from the GTA. The beach is not too crowded and the park was clean. The beach is a little rocky however. Employees extremely rude and accuse people of taking wood from the ground then force people to pay a 80 dollar fine and if you refuse they wait till around 1am after you’ve fall asleep to say you have to leave if you don’t pay. sounds like a scam to me Nice place to camp that's close to the city. Seems loud. Party place. Lots of groups taking over park. Trains. Not a peacefull place. Sound not enforced. Used to be peaceful. Beach all rocks. Nice place for a family picnic, swimming, fishing and a little hiking. It's a nice camp ground but is hard to book for a week Very nice park with structured parking play group and lake with rocks Great!!! Was very pleased easier trail than the others in the area and less dogs it's my new spot! It is a very good and well managed park. Our family attended one of the learner's camp since we were new to camping. it was a wonderful experience. staffs are really nice and knowledgeable.
The reason we chose this park is not so far from Toronto.  for camp beginners , this is the right park. Except for the noisy Trains, simply Beautiful Canadian-Ontarian Park!!
Great Costumer Service!! Great for fall photos :) Love the beach and the view looking out on to Lake Ontario. very nice park for the whole family. Good park, close from home! Peaceful and quiet... Great location for a family picnic Nice place. Train passes by once in a while. Very great to use as a get away! Great breath of fresh air. Frequent noisy trains passing by. Otherwise, great park. A great provincial park on lake Ontario, many sites are open to a view of Lake Ontario but it can get windy at times. Clean washrooms and a decent park store. Nov 29th, dark after 5pm. Good for new camper to start new experience with mother nature. Nice park, very rocky beach Clean large spaces.  Lots of places to engage families.  Down side is traffic noises Nice place Nature is the best way to relax and walking through the park is good exercise. Stayed here a few times! Always well maintained. Clean washrooms and showers.  Lots of good sites. Sites have always been clean and the grass  cut. Water supply and dump out are in an excellent location . Very easy access. Friendly staff and store on site. Got lost in here. It's a big place but lots ro do and really pretty Good place to fishing all year. Good view for sunrise Not the best not the worst. Much nicer going north but it is easy going here. Pretty nice for practically being in Oshawa. Beautiful area, and on the weekday we went not at all crowded. Love the bbq setups they offer and the small information kiosk was quite interesting as well. Amazing for BBQ 🍗 and camping ⛺️ close to the city it is a good urban Provincial Park. Something close to the city to go for a quick nature walk. A great little park for close to home day trips. Has a very nice beach area, plus lots of grass that is very well shaded. There are a lot of picnic tables and grills and a small park for kids to play at. A fair amount of hiking trails and an area to fish in the bay. Good for outdoor enjoyment & activities. Good campground. Beautiful sunrise that day! We only camped there for one night, so I didn't explore much. We camped on the bluffs overlooking Lake Ontario. The view was beautiful, there was a nice breeze off the water and it was relatively quiet in spkte of the many campers. The staff was friendly and helpful and the individual showers were nice and clean. Never gets dark at night, loud 401 traffic, louder train. A nice park not too far from Toronto. Don't expect to see too much nature, but there's some vegetation and the beach. Enough to make your picnic a little bit more than just a BBQ. Very nice place for a walk, lots of wildlife, a great place for camping when in season. Decent campsites, went in off season and it was very quiet. Not many amenities but really, all you need is a hole in the ground for a fire. We had a great weekend here!nice and quiet. The staff is friendly.washrooms and showers are clean.The beach is ok.The camp store is good.
Do not expect a lot of nature/animals and stuff.also there is not much to do here.but would recommend it to someone new to camping since it is close  to Toronto. great views in the winter It's close to us, but also has easy access from 401. The park accommodates all rigs and is quiet at night except for the odd train. There is a very long bike trail running through it too. The worst provincial park hands down!!! Staff need some training in customer service,no manners whatsoever. Washrooms never get cleaned, asked front desk to take out branch that was dead over our camp site at 830 am when they opened on ... Very nice park facility with Beach Decent park, but every site can hear the trains passing near the 401. If you're a light sleeper, probably not the park for you. Beautiful shoreline sites available. Good place for camping and fishing! Stayed there overnight. Amazing facilities. The washrooms were very clean and well maintained. The showers even had hot water!!! The park had a pretty great beach. Its small, the lots are so close together, and there is minimal privacy Too many rocks on the water. Very limited parking spot. Be with nature, peace and nature at this park. very nice place Went for the day. Checked out the campsites and there are a number of nice ones but a number are very slanted. I guess my main gripe is there is no dog beach. That's a selling point for me.  We prefer sandbanks pp for that reason. However you can beat how close it is to the city.  A beautiful sunset.. wide open and quiet most of the time .. i love the duck hunting area here. It's a great place to visit on a windy day, the waves are reminiscent of sea waves, but beware it's not always like that. There's an entry fee for each vehicle, $14 for day pass. I think it's the fee that keeps this park not very busy compared to others. Very disappointed with management and rangers. We booked 10 sites for an event for the weekend. Rangers need to learn how to talk to individuals and not insult them.  Our site was targeted the whole weekend by rangers. Next year we will ... Calm and beautiful place. To much noise, i do not sleep for two nights, train is to close Great park. Nice to see the park wardens keeping us safe and it's nice to see them 
making there appearance to ensure everything ok at night. Thank you.  We stayed in site 6, which was very big and had lots of privacy. Clean park with friendly staff. Great place for hiking and biking Awesome place! Well maintained and close enough to the city for a quick camping trip. Downfall is that you hear the trains and highway at night so you can't even pretend you're in the wilderness. Good park and staff Will always have good memories of my visit here. Very nice and well cared for provincial park. Friendly and professional staff. Nice beach and great trails to walk. Bike riding is a little difficult as there is a lot of hills.  The only thing that I didn't like was the train that ... The best visit ever Clean park and amenities, friendly staff Be with nature on lakeshore. Freezing cold You must have your own canoe or kayak, there is no place to rent. There is nothing special about this park, it's OK. I probably won't return. There are many other provincial parks to go to!  Very nice place for picnic. Beach is not bad too. A little bit of everything the highway and train is next to the park. very noisy Clean and very beautiful park. Camping spots were great too. no outside or highway noises. Best camp site Had a blast. The wet weather has really negatively some of the beach area (flooding) and a very fee number of campsites (mud). The facilities were clean. The electric site we had was excellent. Staff were very friendly. Only stayed one night, July 29/17, as we passed through the area. Really close camp grounds. Good place to ease the family into ""the camping"" experience especially if they like their urban comforts. On-site store has a Keurig, camp cooking tools (stuff you would see in Canadian Tire such as forks, ... Nice place for walks and a mini get away. The camping looks good as well. Nice trails to walk and take in a lil nature.  Bring shoes to go on the beach with, because the rocks will hurt the hell out of your feet otherwise Pretty much a Purdah friendly beach (not many people are around) or I could say barely anyone around! Nice place for a walk Over priced for a walk but would be fun for a bbq The worst provincial park hands down. Excellent walking trails This is a hidden jem - quiet and great park so close to Toronto. Most people just pass it by 401 not even realizing it exists ! Nice place to visit Ok but no electricity Darlington Provincial Park was surprisingly lovely given our proximity to the 401 and major cities. What we liked: Large sites, easy to move about with truck and trailer; the radio free zone, which made listening to the cacophony of bird ... Nice place for camping but too much mosquito s at night Love being right where I can hear the waves  on the lake Great place for barbecue, specially for families. There's also a camping area for those with RVs. Clean washrooms are on site. There's also showers. It's usually crowded on the weekends. You'd better buy everything you need because the grocery store is not that great. Great quick get away from the city. Only half hour away, or an hour with traffic. Nothing too special about the park, but being so close I can't complain. The staff are awesome Nice day park Amazing park and beach... Very clean. The water on the beach was Rocky but the water was so clear I go here all the time.  Sites are big. Bathrooms are clean as can be expected. Has a great park store and lots of stuff for kids. Lots of wildlife to see and lots of paths to explore. Awesome place! So nice place for hangouts.....lots of facilities available over there This is a great local campground but as far as nature and that kind of experience go - the hwy traffic noise and trains kind of dull the shine on the stars. 

However it is typically clean and we'll maintained and we still come here often when we can't get further from home.  Very good place for BBQ and recreational fishing. They offer free fishing lessons and fishing gear. The good is that if you are in town on a busy weekend, there will still be sites available here and it's much cheaper to stay this way than in a hotel.  The bad is mostly related to the noise.  First there is the train noise - the trains ... Excellent park, beach, Good starting place to go camping if you have little ones It's not the place for active dog people. Nice Campgrounds but too many trains close by blasting horns all day and night  The last bit of goodness left in south oshawa It's a money grab! Dropped off and picked up a trailer for family member that were there for a wedding! They only allow you 20 minutes to drop off or pick up which took 15 minutes to find as they didn't give us a map plus to unhook it ... Had a wonderful bday celebration @their picnic spot. Well maintained!. Two steady days of very loud grass cutting machines, anything but peaceful.  Firewood they sell just smolders in the firepits that are full of old ashes and charred wood pieces. Loved it. Going back as soon as they open Beautiful location Great place for camping and for day use! Campsites are separated by the trees and bushes which gives you a privacy and pretty spacious. Showers and washrooms are clean and have a good access from almost every campsite. Lots of fun Pretty nice Nope....don't bother. Great park Nice park with decent beach. Overall it was great staying in the park.  Great place to go for walks Good place for picnics and events. Neatly maintained..,👍 Nice beach Very nice park with a beach area too and lots of tables available  The people are very friendly there Beautiful park but poor job at maintaining the toilets and showers. We were lucky enough to get an electric site on a Friday afternoon of a long weekend. Obviously a good omen because this is a great location! The beach is one of the best we've seen. Our site was big enough for our 32' motorhome with ... Great place to bike and relax in clarington A beautiful park for day use or camping. Great place to camp. You just need a car to get to the park Train is close and blows it's whistle at night. Beautiful beach and grassy area for a day trip Clean place, accessible good for family gatherings and picnics . Beautiful beach area, larger than normal camping lots, cleaner than usual facilities and large areas for walking - has some secluded lots. Great fishing areas, caught some bass and quite a few catfish.

Nature walk areas are fantastic. ... Great for a family camping trip  not too far from the . weekend  This place is great for camping🏕 and for day trip🏖🏜! Showers🛁🚿🛀 and wash-rooms are very clean🗑♻. Great fishing areas🎣🐟🐠. Staff is very friendly.💁🙋 We always love going to Darlington as it is only a short drive away from Toronto. Lots of trails and plenty of spots for a picnic. Water quality may be a bit iffy during summer months, but that's lake Ontario... Fishing was good. Lovely place for an easy-to-get-to campground experience. Love it here. So close to home too An inexpensive and close-to-home camping trip.  Only an hour drive from Toronto. Clean Beach and washrooms. Camp sites are big but no power. Also great from picnics & one day weekend gateway. Pretty area but they require you to have a provincial park parking pass. Beautiful place to spend  the day  and to camp too so disappointed with this park. Was there this weekend. The beach was dirty and stony. The campsites are the same us other provincial parks. The washroom at the lakeside was disgusting. for the whole time that we were there the washroom ... We have camped Cliffside and found it loud with waves crashing all the time, and tried Hilltop but it was too close to the 401 noise. The park itself is great, clean, and friendly staff. Nice park, right on Lake Ontario, problem is, too close to highway and train line Very relaxing Sparse water taps and outdated comfort stations. Low privacy for sites basic and nothing special at all. really rocky beach... I have no clue why this place has such a high rating. not bad but not good The park and the campsite were ok but tge beach was useless too dirty to get in.
Train noise was kind of loud.

I might come back to for the park or the camp...not the beach... Great place. Only problem train pass often at night Was just beautiful water was really clean  and warm  I wasnt there.  I drove by Good campground for families, with swimming, fishing, trails, nature & educational events.  Beach is rocky so bring swimming shoes. Good size campsites, clean and close to home. at night you hear the train passing by It's a great place to do camping. Especially for people who are not hardcore campers. 

Lots of activities at the campsite from learn to fish to study about moths.

Staff is friendly. Clean washrooms. 

Nice big sites to put in 2 or more ... Great beach close to the city. Busy in weekends but you can camp overnight. Hidden gem in the GTA. Reasonable price to get in.  There is 14$ day pass Great camping Great spot. Friendly staff. Amazing views of Lake Ontario and Toronto. Well maintained, beautiful for a day trip or overnight camping. Offers educational activities for kids. Great very good for walking and pictures Good camping ground with electricity outlet; regular and for RVs. Clean warm water showers, clean toilets, clean park. The campsites are very close to one another with almost no privacy.  Love this place for kiteboarding. Nice park within driving distance from Toronto Love this park Clean camping area. Relaxing. Need more sign . We camp here every summer as opposed to staying in hotel for lax tourney in oshawa. The campground is well maintained and has a great view of lake ontario and decent beach . Nice park right next to Lake Ontario but it's patrons insist on campfires during heat emergencies and drought.  The RV hookups can be pretty far from the campsites but extensions are available. Good spot for a day out to escape the hustle and bustle of the city BBQ walk the beach amazing park shame I couldn't walk my dog on the beach We had a nice stay at Darlington Park. However, light sleepers beware! Trains go by every half hour, 24/7! The toilets and showers are not exactly clean (mopping not done in corners, dust and mold build up on the fans in the showers, ... I wasn't there. Great park friendly staff  well maintained  Trains going by in the distance kept waking me up during the night. Rather annoying. Otherwise it is a very nice park. Great park and very close to Toronto Great campground and park for hiking Always enjoy my visits here. The website advertises the rates for seniors at $9.00 but the fee is $11.50. We only wanted to spend a few hours watching the piping plovers and felt the cost was too high. Also, at 8:50 am the washrooms near the beach were not yet open. Great park.. beautiful walkway beside water This is the most underrated park in southeastern Ontario. Waterfront sites are stunning. The campsites are a fair size and the people/atmosphere are nice however I've got to agree with another commenter on why this place has such a high rating. The ONLY reason I could see anyone wanting to stay here is because it's so close ... Worst park I have ever seen. Staff is rude and poor management. And they have problem with 'BROWN FAMILY'. Racist people Ok, but Can fond better Great campgrounds 
But unfortunately you don't see no security 
People were driving to fast for a campground were theirs children's playing. .. Great spot to take the family for the day. BBQ's are available at a first come, first serve basis, beach is clean and tons of trees when you need some shade. Hu nathi gayo to par 5 star 😂😂😂😂😂 Pretty sweet but u have to pay for a day pass which is roughly 15$ Convenient camping location in GTA with standard beautiful Provincial Park service. .   Dirty specially the beaches area. Not going to go back again. Great view, fresh air! A great place to take a rest. Beach not suitable for swim An underrated park in the provincial park system.   Keep in mind that it is an urban oriented park so don't expect it to be like some of the more wilderness oriented parks, but given it's location it has plenty to offer for both RV'ers ... Perfect This is not far from city...401 is viewed from site...train noise Good place for group picnic It has clean bathrooms and you can even see a silhouette/city skyline of Toronto from the lake.  Great place for the family have everything you need. ...the beach was amazing!! Not a bad can ground The trains go by all night, and they always blow their whistle. Not great for camping if your looking to get away from city noises. A nice place to visit. Very beautiful atmosphere. Nice but Rocky beach  The park is really nice but the washrooms were kinda mess Excellent Meh not the best provincial park. It's kind of small, and boring. Train noise all day and night Relaxing Very nice place!Easy access to Beach.Can spend whole day there. $12 for parking! Great place for a weekend camping trip Great place clean washrooms beautiful trees and lake good fishing Nice lakefront campground but close to a busy railroad crossing It's a great Ontario park,  not too far from Toronto!   Nice park Went to pick up my son, not impressed with the young blonde lady that was at the entrance, very rude.  I think the job went to her head.. Not impressed at all!! Nice park - close to Highway. Great views by the lake They had activities lined up for the kids..
The only down fall to the park is the noisy train after a few nights you got used to it Peace and quiet Staff is so cool Noisy from trains. 
Unfriendly service at the entrance and the manager. Didn't let early check in. Suggested to buy additional entrance ticket if we wanted to enter, early even though we had a camping spot reserved for that day. Unpleasantly surprised by young park stuff exercising their authority.  BIG spots, great services. Ask for spot 93! Large green space with sandy/rocky shoreline.  Picnic tables and bbq grills, and water taps available Must visit if in the area Beautiful Provincial park...  Nice place for picnic and BBQ-ing Perfect for a barbecue on a Sunday afternoon. Campsites are not well maintained, and the restrooms are poorly designed and unclean. Nice picnic grounds and okay Beach. I was surprised when they charged $14 for parking Loved it Too bad they do not sell fishing license there! Rail and highway noise is high.  Beautiful park. I was with two small children and a newborn so we were not rambunctious. We received a noise complaint at 8 pm.  Nice beach but great for picnics!  One of these closest parks to Toronto. The tail tracks are noisy at night.  Cool Nice family walk Great Convenient location  The splash area was not working and it has lots of spider webs. The place were you will come over and over again.  Awesome park Peaceful. Awesome park a splendid experience It looks amazing Good spot for camping I love this park,  Beat camping place Cool We went fishing with a few little ones...no licence needed..took picnic basket and made a day of it Relaxing place  Beautiful for pics Large sites  Pokemon go unfriendly stuff Clean  (Translated by Google) This place is beautiful! The noise of the waves, vast terrain, several small paths. On the other hand, the train runs outside the park and makes go sirens day, evening, night at least once an hour ... The day as ... (Translated by Google) Good camping near Toronto. Good atmosphere. Interesting day-time spot and good access to the beach on the shores of Lake Ontario: you can see Toronto in the distance. Near Oshawa.

A long sandy beach on Lake Ontario
Interpretive programs and special eventsWe were pleasantly surprised to be able to book this campsite the same week. The park is well kept, washrooms and showers were clean. We loved how close to the water we could be at short notice. Love the radio free area so not to have to deal with partiers. Will definitely be back. First time visiting park. Spent 2 hours walking various trails and roads admiring birds and squirrels, plus taking in beautiful views of Lake Ontario. Picture shown is from shores of Lake Ontario overlooking McLaughlin Bay at sunset. Definitely worth a visit! Not a bad park. Staff are friendly and helpful. Washrooms are well maintained and store has great ice cream. Sites are a good size too. Improvements that could be made;
Some sites are not private at all. Our site had a water tap in the ... Darlington was a great experience but for a campground, I can't say it was as enjoyable as a place like Presquile or Algonquin. The main issue is how close it is to the train tracks. I live nearby a train line, so I was used to it but ... Camping was fun! Great first time experience for me. Campsite was clean. Huge too. Public washrooms were decent at the beginning, but as time went by, you'd expect them to be maintained - but nope! Overall the beach there is good. Clean. ... First time camping with my family.  Park is nice, entrance is where you get registered and receive a map to the site you have paid for.  You pass by the convenient store before you get to the sites.  Fairly priced logs at $7 a bag, they ... Hard to rate since the park was only partially open. The trails were easy and the day use area looks really nice Took my 3yo on his first overnight camping trip here. Wanted to stay local in case we had to bail out early. We had a blast! Great camp sites and super clean park. We will be back next season! Be sure to stop at the Ranger office and purchase day pass even though the park is closed. They will watch you hang out and drive around and when you leave your car, they ticket you. No warnings at all. We didnt realize once park closes for the season, we still needed a permit. Expensive walk, but nice just the same. Second time at this camp ground. Cool breeze coming off the lake even in the heat wave. Best thing about there is no raccoons. Can play your music pretty much all night (not loud of course) alcohol is allowed. The park rangers are genuinely nice people,very friendly and willing to help. 41.50 to camp near a lake view minutes out of Oshawa.

A slightly hilly area featuring several moderately flat hectares of camping, this Ontario Provincial Park features two hundred and something sites, some with electricity and all with ... Great little park close to the city. Not much good swimming tho. We were pleasantly surprised to be able to book this campsite the same week. The park is well kept, washrooms and showers were clean. We loved how close to the water we could be at short notice. Love the radio free area so not to have to deal with partiers. Will definitely be back. Perfect place to take your kids on their first camping trip.  I just wish there were more fun activities for kids. Couldn't believe there was such a nice little park so close to where we live.  Quaint, small but big enough. And obviously enjoyed by plenty of people.  Sites are well big enough, was quiet, and we enjoyed our stay.  Would not call it our favourite but we will definitely go back without a hesitation. $33 to park my truck on the site on top of the camp site fee. Put my pass on the post and my dash as stated. Wake up to a ticket that was issued at 3 am - ""not displaying pass on my dash"". Very strange as it was there when I woke up. ... Clean, calm. Water was warmish & crystal clear. The shore is rocky & entry into water was rocky 2 meters. Then sand. Water drops off quickly. Couldn't have asked for a better day. Nice small park close to Lake Ontario, with camping facilities.  Great for summer fun. Awesome beach, fishing training was free  for kids and small park. it's nice for everyone specially families..got sand too for kids like mine need sand to play Love it. Been camping there two years in a row. Great for kids and large groups and families, and couples alike.  Beach is near by with picnic area.  All around relaxing. A great place to excape the extreme city heatwave. I would recommend this park. It has trails to hike, fish to catch and lots of areas to camp. The staff is extremely informative and friendly. Excellent location for visiting TO and surrounding areas.
All the facilities showers, water and electricity.

When we arrived after booking on line our spot was taken #34 and My Hubby is handicapped and we needed that closeness to the ... Really nice park as far as PPs go. Most sites are BIG. Beach is mostly small stone and not nice to walk on barefoot. A lot of trains pass close by but you get used to it. In a trailer anyway. Probably louder if in a tent. Daily events for children and a nice play area. Store with basics. Overall a nice place. Love this park, great for small or large gatherings, camping, there's a lake also so you just follow the trails that will lead you there. Be with nature for a while.. We've been having our Annual picnic there for over 30+ years. Awesome campsites close to home. The only downside is the proximity to the highway, train tracks and the level crossing (train horns). Excellent beach and hiking areas. The place is wonderful, we were wondering why nobody's mentioned it before... Until we eared the train whistle... Multiple time... During the night!!! Nice shaded, private sites. Beach is very rocky. Building sand sculptures is out. Need to walk about 3 meters/9 feet into the water before reaching sand. Recommend water shoes. Loved that we could bbq near a bench and ate our food then sat by the beach side. The waves are pretty high in this beach compared to sauble beach. Water I'd also a little milky grey color. It is definitely a family beach. The downside ... We were on site 226. Adequate privacy as the site is surrounded by trees and brush. One side of the campsite has a trail along side it and you see everybody who walks along it through the bushes. The site is rated for 30' trailers but ... Had a great time, walked to the beach and saw the pioneer cemetery. 

Our dog loved his first time camping and we will definitely be back. Very secured place to camp. Ontario Parks and OPP surveillance. Neatly maintained camp ground and most of the camp sites are shady all day.. :)  the beach is full of moss on the shores and untidy.. but the waves are the best.. we can have fun and the day camping site isgood too. Constant trains all night long made it difficult to sleep. Site 311 was good for hammock camping.  The staff did a good job of policing the park. Nice camping lots. Washrooms aren't the greatest and shower water was always cold. Staff was nice and welcoming. Told the staff my firepit was full and they came to take care of it.
If you're used to more quiet camping/hearing the ... Staff need to clean the washrooms and the shower almost 1 or 2 hours. Showers were so dirty with tissues and other dirty stuff. But none one came to clean until 6 or 7 pm. 
Then Sunday night to Monday around 10am. Nothing were cleaned. ... Nice and close to home.
Nice walking paths, waterfront, and some easy hiking close by. 
Only downfall to this park is train passing occasionally. Absolutely do not recommend. We left the kids with the grandparents for the weekend and drove two hours to camp with three friends. The gate staff were really friendly but the rangers were AWFUL. They harassed us on our site, on the ... Great beach and also amazing views. Good spot for picnic and camping Staff are incredibly rude.  Security is way to overzealous.  Harassing families with children.  Definitely don't treat you like a paying customer.  Would never go here again My visit was in late June.
The day park is okay and the staff are great people but some of them need to grow some balls. They have to manage the use of the picnic benches better and stop allowing 6 people to have 4 tables. One to sit on ... Nice park. Large sites. Well maintained. Noise of the 401 hwy is the only negative. A nice park but washrooms are so far from our picnic area and should be a bit more central. Beautiful place, nice beach but noisy for camping. The camp grounds are very close to railway and you hear the noise of trains and horn almost every 10 minutes during the night. Great place to bring my dog Had a lovely Sunday walk with my family and our dogs. Beautiful views.  Lots of comfort stations and washrooms.  But very noisy with the train horning every 10mins... It's unreal.  Don't camp here if you prefer quietness. great spot to camp for a few days Nice place but the train runs right beside the park. It goes by several times during the day and several times at night and blows a very loud whistle. Very hard to sleep this way. Average campground. Convenient amenities. Lots of things to do for kids. Not so much for adults. Beach was kind of messy. Ok for families, but don't bother bringing a group of friends. Great open park but you have to pay $15 to get in which is understandable considering the amount of work they put into the park to make it great. We went for camping for a night .Had an amazing experience. Clean washrooms and very secure place to go with your family. Quite enjoyable place, when the weather is warm! It's an ok park. Dont expect your typical provincial park out in the wilderness. The highway is loud and trains go by all the time blowing there whistle. The beach is ok for rock collecting. Not good for laying on the beach or swimming. I was there first week in September. It may be different earlier in the summer Got a day pass to go to the beach and we could hardly walk down to the water because of all the rocks jabbing into our feet. Water gets deep very quickly, not good for small children. Over all disappointed and wont be going back. Worst camping trip! 
Firstly, when you come in to register they will charge you $15 per night for any additional vehicles on site & as the staff will not inform you about it as to how many your allowed to have on your site & will charge ... Excellent camping, wonderful workers, it's heaven on Earth, it's the only place to go The site was great..very quiet.  My only problem was the biting ants..they were a nightmare but I still gave 4 stars because it's not the parks fault.  Bring lots of big spray We were camping ng here for the first time. Not the first camping trip though. Not the best experience. Don’t get me wrong , campsites are clean and spacious,lake is not to far walk. My only problem was that I could hear highway and ... It was the worst park that we ever went to. The ranger there are so rude and racist. They started to harass us about other people’s garbage, that we weren’t even near to but, like the good samaritans we are, we picked it up anyways. He ... Nice park. Beautiful views of Lake Ontario. Lovely beach. Perhaps too rocky not enough sand. Water is not so clean either. Staff are helpful and very nice.  I will be returning. Very small park. Skinny broken trees.. no privacy.. dirty washrooms& shower. Especially washroom cleaning time is way longer than other provincial parks. I dont know what staffs do in the washroom during cleaning time. Had to wait more than 20mins whenever they clean the washroom. We were picking apples which were wasted in the ground and the security guy came and behaved like a racist charged us and threatened to fine. Very rude behavior. Worst provincial park ever. If I could, I would give 0 stars. The water was thick and green with algae, beach was rocky and dirty, and the washrooms were so desgusiting my 2 year old refused to use them. Not worth the $14.50 for a day pass. It is worth the drive to...anywhere else. Love this place. Its great if your looking to enjoy some quite time. But I do think they should add some more things there for kids. I like it here. Nature to. We go for hikes. One of the loveliest parks for the day use. Highly recommended. This is a beautiful Provincial Park located on the shores of lake ontario. The unfortunate thing about this park is it proximity to both the 401 and the main train line that runs between Toronto and Montreal. From our campsite, we had no ... It is a nice park not too far from Toronto. It is by lake ontario not so great for swimming since it is lake ontario however it is covenient for those who do not want to travel far and enjoy one or two nights of camping. Loved it ❤ I had the campsite right next to the lake and it was so nice! It's only an hour away from Toronto. It is good place for camping!! But not quite though..you can hear train horn in midnight..wash rooms are o.k. not to expect cleanlines. Very clean and well managed. There is a nice variety of fauna and flora. It's easy to forget you're close to the 401 and the city of Oshawa. Great place visit if you are looking for a natural environment that is in close proximity to Oshawa/Clarington. Good camp site's. Security is annoying, pick on the wrong people. No radios.... but the Train runs all night and day? Always so fun and so peaceful.  You definitely need to go and camp there at least a few nights Best place to visit with family soacially picnic aeria 4 Camping with the kids was great.  Train was a little loud, but good overall. Great place they just need to keep the bathrooms clean. Nice beach and campground area. Decent campsites. Didn't get a chance to hike the trails. Didn't appreciate staff and OPP circling campsites hourly. They were not being helpful, but trying to lay fines for park infractions. I would ... Excellent location must visit in summer Good park good sized camping sites. Had to pay for entry which was $14, not worth it. No proper place to sit but otherwise the view was amazing Great park for a day trip from the GTA. The beach is not too crowded and the park was clean. The beach is a little rocky however. Employees extremely rude and accuse people of taking wood from the ground then force people to pay a 80 dollar fine and if you refuse they wait till around 1am after you’ve fall asleep to say you have to leave if you don’t pay. sounds like a scam to me Nice place to camp that's close to the city. Seems loud. Party place. Lots of groups taking over park. Trains. Not a peacefull place. Sound not enforced. Used to be peaceful. Beach all rocks. Nice place for a family picnic, swimming, fishing and a little hiking. It's a nice camp ground but is hard to book for a week Very nice park with structured parking play group and lake with rocks Great!!! Was very pleased easier trail than the others in the area and less dogs it's my new spot! It is a very good and well managed park. Our family attended one of the learner's camp since we were new to camping. it was a wonderful experience. staffs are really nice and knowledgeable.
The reason we chose this park is not so far from Toronto.  for camp beginners , this is the right park. Except for the noisy Trains, simply Beautiful Canadian-Ontarian Park!!
Great Costumer Service!! Great for fall photos :) Love the beach and the view looking out on to Lake Ontario. very nice park for the whole family. Good park, close from home! Peaceful and quiet... Great location for a family picnic Nice place. Train passes by once in a while. Very great to use as a get away! Great breath of fresh air. Frequent noisy trains passing by. Otherwise, great park. A great provincial park on lake Ontario, many sites are open to a view of Lake Ontario but it can get windy at times. Clean washrooms and a decent park store. Nov 29th, dark after 5pm. Good for new camper to start new experience with mother nature. Nice park, very rocky beach Clean large spaces.  Lots of places to engage families.  Down side is traffic noises Nice place Nature is the best way to relax and walking through the park is good exercise. Stayed here a few times! Always well maintained. Clean washrooms and showers.  Lots of good sites. Sites have always been clean and the grass  cut. Water supply and dump out are in an excellent location . Very easy access. Friendly staff and store on site. Got lost in here. It's a big place but lots ro do and really pretty Good place to fishing all year. Good view for sunrise Not the best not the worst. Much nicer going north but it is easy going here. Pretty nice for practically being in Oshawa. Beautiful area, and on the weekday we went not at all crowded. Love the bbq setups they offer and the small information kiosk was quite interesting as well. Amazing for BBQ 🍗 and camping ⛺️ close to the city it is a good urban Provincial Park. Something close to the city to go for a quick nature walk. A great little park for close to home day trips. Has a very nice beach area, plus lots of grass that is very well shaded. There are a lot of picnic tables and grills and a small park for kids to play at. A fair amount of hiking trails and an area to fish in the bay. Good for outdoor enjoyment & activities. Good campground. Beautiful sunrise that day! We only camped there for one night, so I didn't explore much. We camped on the bluffs overlooking Lake Ontario. The view was beautiful, there was a nice breeze off the water and it was relatively quiet in spkte of the many campers. The staff was friendly and helpful and the individual showers were nice and clean. Never gets dark at night, loud 401 traffic, louder train. A nice park not too far from Toronto. Don't expect to see too much nature, but there's some vegetation and the beach. Enough to make your picnic a little bit more than just a BBQ. Very nice place for a walk, lots of wildlife, a great place for camping when in season. Decent campsites, went in off season and it was very quiet. Not many amenities but really, all you need is a hole in the ground for a fire. We had a great weekend here!nice and quiet. The staff is friendly.washrooms and showers are clean.The beach is ok.The camp store is good.
Do not expect a lot of nature/animals and stuff.also there is not much to do here.but would recommend it to someone new to camping since it is close  to Toronto. great views in the winter It's close to us, but also has easy access from 401. The park accommodates all rigs and is quiet at night except for the odd train. There is a very long bike trail running through it too. The worst provincial park hands down!!! Staff need some training in customer service,no manners whatsoever. Washrooms never get cleaned, asked front desk to take out branch that was dead over our camp site at 830 am when they opened on ... Very nice park facility with Beach Decent park, but every site can hear the trains passing near the 401. If you're a light sleeper, probably not the park for you. Beautiful shoreline sites available. Good place for camping and fishing! Stayed there overnight. Amazing facilities. The washrooms were very clean and well maintained. The showers even had hot water!!! The park had a pretty great beach. Its small, the lots are so close together, and there is minimal privacy Too many rocks on the water. Very limited parking spot. Be with nature, peace and nature at this park. very nice place Went for the day. Checked out the campsites and there are a number of nice ones but a number are very slanted. I guess my main gripe is there is no dog beach. That's a selling point for me.  We prefer sandbanks pp for that reason. However you can beat how close it is to the city.  A beautiful sunset.. wide open and quiet most of the time .. i love the duck hunting area here. It's a great place to visit on a windy day, the waves are reminiscent of sea waves, but beware it's not always like that. There's an entry fee for each vehicle, $14 for day pass. I think it's the fee that keeps this park not very busy compared to others. Very disappointed with management and rangers. We booked 10 sites for an event for the weekend. Rangers need to learn how to talk to individuals and not insult them.  Our site was targeted the whole weekend by rangers. Next year we will ... Calm and beautiful place. To much noise, i do not sleep for two nights, train is to close Great park. Nice to see the park wardens keeping us safe and it's nice to see them 
making there appearance to ensure everything ok at night. Thank you.  We stayed in site 6, which was very big and had lots of privacy. Clean park with friendly staff. Great place for hiking and biking Awesome place! Well maintained and close enough to the city for a quick camping trip. Downfall is that you hear the trains and highway at night so you can't even pretend you're in the wilderness. Good park and staff Will always have good memories of my visit here. Very nice and well cared for provincial park. Friendly and professional staff. Nice beach and great trails to walk. Bike riding is a little difficult as there is a lot of hills.  The only thing that I didn't like was the train that ... The best visit ever Clean park and amenities, friendly staff Be with nature on lakeshore. Freezing cold You must have your own canoe or kayak, there is no place to rent. There is nothing special about this park, it's OK. I probably won't return. There are many other provincial parks to go to!  Very nice place for picnic. Beach is not bad too. A little bit of everything the highway and train is next to the park. very noisy Clean and very beautiful park. Camping spots were great too. no outside or highway noises. Best camp site Had a blast. The wet weather has really negatively some of the beach area (flooding) and a very fee number of campsites (mud). The facilities were clean. The electric site we had was excellent. Staff were very friendly. Only stayed one night, July 29/17, as we passed through the area. Really close camp grounds. Good place to ease the family into ""the camping"" experience especially if they like their urban comforts. On-site store has a Keurig, camp cooking tools (stuff you would see in Canadian Tire such as forks, ... Nice place for walks and a mini get away. The camping looks good as well. Nice trails to walk and take in a lil nature.  Bring shoes to go on the beach with, because the rocks will hurt the hell out of your feet otherwise Pretty much a Purdah friendly beach (not many people are around) or I could say barely anyone around! Nice place for a walk Over priced for a walk but would be fun for a bbq The worst provincial park hands down. Excellent walking trails This is a hidden jem - quiet and great park so close to Toronto. Most people just pass it by 401 not even realizing it exists ! Nice place to visit Ok but no electricity Darlington Provincial Park was surprisingly lovely given our proximity to the 401 and major cities. What we liked: Large sites, easy to move about with truck and trailer; the radio free zone, which made listening to the cacophony of bird ... Nice place for camping but too much mosquito s at night Love being right where I can hear the waves  on the lake Great place for barbecue, specially for families. There's also a camping area for those with RVs. Clean washrooms are on site. There's also showers. It's usually crowded on the weekends. You'd better buy everything you need because the grocery store is not that great. Great quick get away from the city. Only half hour away, or an hour with traffic. Nothing too special about the park, but being so close I can't complain. The staff are awesome Nice day park Amazing park and beach... Very clean. The water on the beach was Rocky but the water was so clear I go here all the time.  Sites are big. Bathrooms are clean as can be expected. Has a great park store and lots of stuff for kids. Lots of wildlife to see and lots of paths to explore. Awesome place! So nice place for hangouts.....lots of facilities available over there This is a great local campground but as far as nature and that kind of experience go - the hwy traffic noise and trains kind of dull the shine on the stars. 

However it is typically clean and we'll maintained and we still come here often when we can't get further from home.  Very good place for BBQ and recreational fishing. They offer free fishing lessons and fishing gear. The good is that if you are in town on a busy weekend, there will still be sites available here and it's much cheaper to stay this way than in a hotel.  The bad is mostly related to the noise.  First there is the train noise - the trains ... Excellent park, beach, Good starting place to go camping if you have little ones It's not the place for active dog people. Nice Campgrounds but too many trains close by blasting horns all day and night  The last bit of goodness left in south oshawa It's a money grab! Dropped off and picked up a trailer for family member that were there for a wedding! They only allow you 20 minutes to drop off or pick up which took 15 minutes to find as they didn't give us a map plus to unhook it ... Had a wonderful bday celebration @their picnic spot. Well maintained!. Two steady days of very loud grass cutting machines, anything but peaceful.  Firewood they sell just smolders in the firepits that are full of old ashes and charred wood pieces. Loved it. Going back as soon as they open Beautiful location Great place for camping and for day use! Campsites are separated by the trees and bushes which gives you a privacy and pretty spacious. Showers and washrooms are clean and have a good access from almost every campsite. Lots of fun Pretty nice Nope....don't bother. Great park Nice park with decent beach. Overall it was great staying in the park.  Great place to go for walks Good place for picnics and events. Neatly maintained..,👍 Nice beach Very nice park with a beach area too and lots of tables available  The people are very friendly there Beautiful park but poor job at maintaining the toilets and showers. We were lucky enough to get an electric site on a Friday afternoon of a long weekend. Obviously a good omen because this is a great location! The beach is one of the best we've seen. Our site was big enough for our 32' motorhome with ... Great place to bike and relax in clarington A beautiful park for day use or camping. Great place to camp. You just need a car to get to the park Train is close and blows it's whistle at night. Beautiful beach and grassy area for a day trip Clean place, accessible good for family gatherings and picnics . Beautiful beach area, larger than normal camping lots, cleaner than usual facilities and large areas for walking - has some secluded lots. Great fishing areas, caught some bass and quite a few catfish.

Nature walk areas are fantastic. ... Great for a family camping trip  not too far from the . weekend  This place is great for camping🏕 and for day trip🏖🏜! Showers🛁🚿🛀 and wash-rooms are very clean🗑♻. Great fishing areas🎣🐟🐠. Staff is very friendly.💁🙋 We always love going to Darlington as it is only a short drive away from Toronto. Lots of trails and plenty of spots for a picnic. Water quality may be a bit iffy during summer months, but that's lake Ontario... Fishing was good. Lovely place for an easy-to-get-to campground experience. Love it here. So close to home too An inexpensive and close-to-home camping trip.  Only an hour drive from Toronto. Clean Beach and washrooms. Camp sites are big but no power. Also great from picnics & one day weekend gateway. Pretty area but they require you to have a provincial park parking pass. Beautiful place to spend  the day  and to camp too so disappointed with this park. Was there this weekend. The beach was dirty and stony. The campsites are the same us other provincial parks. The washroom at the lakeside was disgusting. for the whole time that we were there the washroom ... We have camped Cliffside and found it loud with waves crashing all the time, and tried Hilltop but it was too close to the 401 noise. The park itself is great, clean, and friendly staff. Nice park, right on Lake Ontario, problem is, too close to highway and train line Very relaxing Sparse water taps and outdated comfort stations. Low privacy for sites basic and nothing special at all. really rocky beach... I have no clue why this place has such a high rating. not bad but not good The park and the campsite were ok but tge beach was useless too dirty to get in.
Train noise was kind of loud.

I might come back to for the park or the camp...not the beach... Great place. Only problem train pass often at night Was just beautiful water was really clean  and warm  I wasnt there.  I drove by Good campground for families, with swimming, fishing, trails, nature & educational events.  Beach is rocky so bring swimming shoes. Good size campsites, clean and close to home. at night you hear the train passing by It's a great place to do camping. Especially for people who are not hardcore campers. 

Lots of activities at the campsite from learn to fish to study about moths.

Staff is friendly. Clean washrooms. 

Nice big sites to put in 2 or more ... Great beach close to the city. Busy in weekends but you can camp overnight. Hidden gem in the GTA. Reasonable price to get in.  There is 14$ day pass Great camping Great spot. Friendly staff. Amazing views of Lake Ontario and Toronto. Well maintained, beautiful for a day trip or overnight camping. Offers educational activities for kids. Great very good for walking and pictures Good camping ground with electricity outlet; regular and for RVs. Clean warm water showers, clean toilets, clean park. The campsites are very close to one another with almost no privacy.  Love this place for kiteboarding. Nice park within driving distance from Toronto Love this park Clean camping area. Relaxing. Need more sign . We camp here every summer as opposed to staying in hotel for lax tourney in oshawa. The campground is well maintained and has a great view of lake ontario and decent beach . Nice park right next to Lake Ontario but it's patrons insist on campfires during heat emergencies and drought.  The RV hookups can be pretty far from the campsites but extensions are available. Good spot for a day out to escape the hustle and bustle of the city BBQ walk the beach amazing park shame I couldn't walk my dog on the beach We had a nice stay at Darlington Park. However, light sleepers beware! Trains go by every half hour, 24/7! The toilets and showers are not exactly clean (mopping not done in corners, dust and mold build up on the fans in the showers, ... I wasn't there. Great park friendly staff  well maintained  Trains going by in the distance kept waking me up during the night. Rather annoying. Otherwise it is a very nice park. Great park and very close to Toronto Great campground and park for hiking Always enjoy my visits here. The website advertises the rates for seniors at $9.00 but the fee is $11.50. We only wanted to spend a few hours watching the piping plovers and felt the cost was too high. Also, at 8:50 am the washrooms near the beach were not yet open. Great park.. beautiful walkway beside water This is the most underrated park in southeastern Ontario. Waterfront sites are stunning. The campsites are a fair size and the people/atmosphere are nice however I've got to agree with another commenter on why this place has such a high rating. The ONLY reason I could see anyone wanting to stay here is because it's so close ... Worst park I have ever seen. Staff is rude and poor management. And they have problem with 'BROWN FAMILY'. Racist people Ok, but Can fond better Great campgrounds 
But unfortunately you don't see no security 
People were driving to fast for a campground were theirs children's playing. .. Great spot to take the family for the day. BBQ's are available at a first come, first serve basis, beach is clean and tons of trees when you need some shade. Hu nathi gayo to par 5 star 😂😂😂😂😂 Pretty sweet but u have to pay for a day pass which is roughly 15$ Convenient camping location in GTA with standard beautiful Provincial Park service. .   Dirty specially the beaches area. Not going to go back again. Great view, fresh air! A great place to take a rest. Beach not suitable for swim An underrated park in the provincial park system.   Keep in mind that it is an urban oriented park so don't expect it to be like some of the more wilderness oriented parks, but given it's location it has plenty to offer for both RV'ers ... Perfect This is not far from city...401 is viewed from site...train noise Good place for group picnic It has clean bathrooms and you can even see a silhouette/city skyline of Toronto from the lake.  Great place for the family have everything you need. ...the beach was amazing!! Not a bad can ground The trains go by all night, and they always blow their whistle. Not great for camping if your looking to get away from city noises. A nice place to visit. Very beautiful atmosphere. Nice but Rocky beach  The park is really nice but the washrooms were kinda mess Excellent Meh not the best provincial park. It's kind of small, and boring. Train noise all day and night Relaxing Very nice place!Easy access to Beach.Can spend whole day there. $12 for parking! Great place for a weekend camping trip Great place clean washrooms beautiful trees and lake good fishing Nice lakefront campground but close to a busy railroad crossing It's a great Ontario park,  not too far from Toronto!   Nice park Went to pick up my son, not impressed with the young blonde lady that was at the entrance, very rude.  I think the job went to her head.. Not impressed at all!! Nice park - close to Highway. Great views by the lake They had activities lined up for the kids..
The only down fall to the park is the noisy train after a few nights you got used to it Peace and quiet Staff is so cool Noisy from trains. 
Unfriendly service at the entrance and the manager. Didn't let early check in. Suggested to buy additional entrance ticket if we wanted to enter, early even though we had a camping spot reserved for that day. Unpleasantly surprised by young park stuff exercising their authority.  BIG spots, great services. Ask for spot 93! Large green space with sandy/rocky shoreline.  Picnic tables and bbq grills, and water taps available Must visit if in the area Beautiful Provincial park...  Nice place for picnic and BBQ-ing Perfect for a barbecue on a Sunday afternoon. Campsites are not well maintained, and the restrooms are poorly designed and unclean. Nice picnic grounds and okay Beach. I was surprised when they charged $14 for parking Loved it Too bad they do not sell fishing license there! Rail and highway noise is high.  Beautiful park. I was with two small children and a newborn so we were not rambunctious. We received a noise complaint at 8 pm.  Nice beach but great for picnics!  One of these closest parks to Toronto. The tail tracks are noisy at night.  Cool Nice family walk Great Convenient location  The splash area was not working and it has lots of spider webs. The place were you will come over and over again.  Awesome park Peaceful. Awesome park a splendid experience It looks amazing Good spot for camping I love this park,  Beat camping place Cool We went fishing with a few little ones...no licence needed..took picnic basket and made a day of it Relaxing place  Beautiful for pics Large sites  Pokemon go unfriendly stuff Clean  (Translated by Google) This place is beautiful! The noise of the waves, vast terrain, several small paths. On the other hand, the train runs outside the park and makes go sirens day, evening, night at least once an hour ... The day as ... (Translated by Google) Good camping near Toronto. Good atmosphere. Interesting day-time spot and good access to the beach on the shores of Lake Ontario: you can see Toronto in the distance.

The park it's clean and well maintained and the access fee is reasonable. The staff is very helpful and friendly. There is a pool which is gorgeous, with lifeguards and some shade. There is a lake ... I ran a half marathon through the park and had a grand time. The park looks like it would be a fun place to come and stay! Our own little secret in Alliston!  If you have been here before, you'll come again.  Great place just located minutes away of great amenities if you need last minute things.  Fun trails, picnic spots, water fun and well kept.  See you there!👍 Arrived at check in and set up. Decided to swim afterward... Beach was closed due to bacteria levels. Totally fine, can't be helped or predicted and besides there's a pool... IF YOU PAY EXTRA. Seriously. Makes sense for day trippers, but ... Excellent camping in the Riverside campground. The ""lake"" isn't great to swim in if you're used to a real lake and not what is essentially a flooded river, but it suffices for boating and they have a large swimming pool for when the lake ... Absolutely beautiful. I would definitely recommend Earl Rowe. Throughout my week long trip, there was only one downside, the unsafe beach. The pool is lovely, the campsites are wonderful, the staff are very helpful. There are some very lovely trails that were so neat. This is one of my favourite campgrounds. Some of the best sites you can find but these days the nights are filled with traffic sounds. On top of that, the lake is no longer open due to bacteria levels. Barely a 3, but the sites are top notch and so are the trails. Almost everything you'd expect from a provincial park (which is usually pretty good, in my books). The beach being closed KILLED our vacation, however. There was no indication on their website that the beach was inaccessible - in fact, ... Great park with beach and a number of short trails.  When i was here during the fall hundreds of geese were taking a break in the water on their way South.  There is a swimming pool open during the summer. Not a great park for hiking, especially in the winter! As a summer camping experience it is one of the better near city experiences. Shamefully attended the learn to camp program.  Turned out to be a great weekend.  Staff was knowedgeable, friendly and always available to help. Used to come here all the time as a kid and this was my first time back in over 15 years. Not too far from home for us but I think the trek to go somewhere else is worth it at this point. It was never mentioned when I booked the site or ... This is a great park close to the city.  The huge swimming pool makes up for the man made lake that is not much fun to swim in.  The canoes and paddle boats are the best way to enjoy the lake. My husband and I used to go to this park 3/4 years ago once or even twice a year and both my husband and dad grew up spending their summers here. We went in September and I will never go back. The lake is full of e-coli so it's a ... Very spacious sites. Matures are mostly evergreens and mature. Pool is amazing when open. Beach is huge but water quality is lacking. Great for canoeing and fishing off the bridges. Actually watch a turtle lay eggs right beside the pathway! Parks are small and old fashioned. Great trails and camp sites. An acre sized swimming pool for when the lake water quality is poor. Laundry and shower facilities. Trailer fill and dump stations. Full LTE connectivity (I'm on bell) The park is good in itself for recreation. It's good for families and friends to go on picnic, relax and talk. No swimming facilities though there is a big pool but it is not suited for serious swimming. Beautiful Provincial Park near Alliston. Has grassy sites, lots of bike trails, a small lake, pool, and close to shopping. I visited this park with my family at the beginning of september as we like to scout the camp grounds before making booking camp site for next summer. The horrible smell ruined our day trip. the lake stunk really bad. The hiking trail was not too bad and the look up spot offered a beautiful view. Beautiful campground. Great place for a family getaway. Unfortunately it rained for half my stay but I still enjoyed myself. Nice place if you love nature. Soccer and volleyball ground if you are into sports. Water not so good but okay for boating.. Around $15 at entrance A nice place to visit for one day, not very recommend for camping. All campsites should have a clean lake where campers can swim or just be around the beach area. This is a whole business. They ensure the lake looks so unattractive that ... Surprisingly great campground for its location. Private spots, big lake fishing or bike around . big pool for kids of all ages. Great location. Would definitely go back Getting a bit run down but all in all a good place to camp, swim, hike... campsites are big enough that two or three tents would fit easily in each campsite. You can hike or canoeing too.In terms of campsite privacy is really good too. Perhaps not as good as ArrowHead Park if you have been there but definitely  better than most other place. Plus that it is very close to the city. Nice park close to Toronto. Good picnic areas. Very nice walking trails. Get park. Big. Lots of parking space. Kids loved the pool. Able to BBQ.
Great pinic spot for large family gathering. Great picnic and camping site. Lots of easy trails and good for dogs to go on a walk. Parking was $15 on the weekend. Great place to camp! Not too far from the city. Clean, friendly staff. Family fun!! We come every year. I found riverside was the only area with the really scenic sites, but only a few sites had a good view of the river, which was my biggest disappointment. The lake is nice, but if you don't plan to swim or stay for a picnic, it's not that ... Great park to camp. The water is great for a couple hour paddle. Lots of geese and their waste though🤭 I love the pool here! It's humongous and perfect for all family members. Lots of fun memories here as a kid, always something going on for the kids to do and the pool is very nice👍 Fresh coat of paint in the pool too. Sites are fairly big and nice. Close to Alliston for shops and food and whatnot We're currently camping here at Earl Rowe in the Heydon Way area.  I'm giving 3 stars because overall our experience has been great.  The bathrooms are kept reasonably clean and stocked, sites are nice and ours has enough privacy. ... Been camping there since i was a fetus (literally) my favorite provincial park! Used to camp here as a child and it was my first time back! Loved the camp grounds very clean they have a big pool .you do have to pay $3.25 per adult and $2.75 per child but it's a good alternative to the lake. Nice campground with large sites. Too bad the Lake is gross. Perfect park for camping, fishing and just relaxing. Big size campsites. Not far from Toronto. Great place to introduce our little one to camping. Friendly staff, nice sites.  Was a little disappointed that we weren't able to get into the water at the beach. Nice but short day of fishing (weather related) will definately come again to explore Beautiful campground with many large sites. Beaches have been taken over by geese. Use the pool. Bathrooms and showers are clean. Frendily staff, nice sites.  Didn't get a chance to check out the beach though. Terrible!!!!!! This park is a joke !!! 
we are in the handy cap spot so my husband has access to the showers as he has a Hard time walking far distances. Yes he is a handicapped flacker holder!!... the shower that is for handicapped was ... Fantastic group site. Nice amenities near by. Swimming pool is a bonus. Could be a wonderful park, but it has been so  overrun by geese and seagulls that the only swimming option is to pay to use the pool. Great place for walking and BBQ. The lake is contaminated with bacteria and it is not safe for swimming. Great camping park with very good facilities. It is a shame the lake is always polluted. Maybe something could be done about or it could be stocked with fish for kids to catch. Great comfortable place great if you have kids or dogs with lots to do Less crowded, nice swimming pool, good trail - bacteria and algae full beach Took my grandson to a ""learn to fish program"" it was excellent. I did not enjoy my experience at all during the time I was at Earl Rowe. I don't even know where to start. We go to checkin and we are told we need to go to the other side of the street because we are in Riverside. This is absolutely ... Never coming back. Not enough patrols and don't do anything about people from other sites walking through yours. People throw garbage all over the place. Worst provincial park ever. And shining headlights of there cars into your site from theirs. Best and beautiful place.  Greatly. Had a nice lots neighbors were nice Smallish park, reasonable facilities. Check water conditions before going due to occasional beach closures. Nice scenery. No natural water lake system to swim in but there is a pool that you have to pay to get into. This is a great walking park many great trails to walk whether it is beside the pond or by the dam or even along the river there is something for everyone. There are also many camping spots that are a little more private you do not have to be directly on top of other campers. Great camping, close to the city and we had a fantastic time our family  will be back again. It's a nice place for camping but the camping spot is a little bit open, less private. Enjoyed are time there, nice big private sights Lovely Provincial Park, dog friendly (even on one of the beaches! 🙌), new-looking comfort stations/washrooms & showers. Pit toilets are still the pits.

Rainbow Run trail is an unusual but nice trail to hike - not much elevation, ... Went for camping on the canada day long weekend, good place, but don’t expect to have much at the beach as the water quality was really bad and there were bird poops every where! Very smelly! I've spent the last 18 years in this park during all 4 seasons. I love it and it feels like a part of me! Nice big beach area, and nobody was there because unfortunately the water was not safe to swim in. You have to pay to use the pool, which is ridiculous. Camp sites in Trillium campground seem to be bigger and have more trees.b It was a good park, but recommending swimming in the park. Great for picnics. Great park for kids. River wasn't great because of the bird flock leftovers - yuck Very good place to go for camping. Facility is awesome, electricity, shower, washroom are all available on site.  the only thing that I think is negtive is that the site thay we stay at were bit far from the lake and wd had to drive for 5minutes for that. Clean sites. Lots to do for kids. Awesome place to go friendly sraff and trails kept clear stayed in fletcher and spots were big 😃 definetly goin again Very nice place to go camping but not the best Good if you like the convenience of being close to a town for supplies. It does not have clean natural water to go in; instead there is a big swimming pool that they charge you do use. It doesn't really feel like camping with all the ... This place has gone down hill ever since i was a kid. The water is terrible they keep failing water tests. I would pass on this place and camp somewhere else. You would think that because the lake has ecoli that they would make the pool free, but no they charge you more to use it on top of day fees and camping fees Very nice park.  Great place to camp, fish and ride bikes.  An all round place to enjoy the outdoors. Besides being eaten alive, we enjoyed our 3 day weekend here and will return. My daughter and I camped here the other night, and had a great time. 
Pros: The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The afternoon activities at the visitor center were fun and educational for kids. The park is well maintained, ... Great family location. Well maintained Close to GTA campground with nice hiking trails. This park seems to be better suited for camping than others I've seen so far. Sites are separated way more from each other, so from our site I was able to hear others (good for safety) but not see them (good for privacy). I was ... Friendly staff and great campsite. just bring some OFF spray for the mosquitoes Amazing park for picnic and a huge pool for swim lovers A very nice provincial park for all activities Had a lot of fun here with some friends. We got a little rowdy late at night and the park officer was very understanding and patient. The only downside was the lake was literally surrounded by goose poo, the first 5 feet of water was just pure poop.  Very nice park. Swimming in the man-made lake is awful, but the pool is terrific, and the price is good. $3.75 for adult admission to the pool. Plenty of picnic tables and canoe & kayak rentals. Food trucks, too. Great place for a fun day.  We go every year and we always have a great time. great place for camping lots of bugs
they stick a handicap person way out in the back 40 1st visit, loved it, bathrooms were in much better shape than expected, clean and neat camp grounds. No bad campers made the experience pretty awesome. Did not like that the lake is not swim friendly, it was too cold to try the pool. ... A great place for camping.. thoroughly enjoyed. Place is well equipped with wash rooms and there are showers with hot water running throughout the day... Be aware of racoons in the night. They certainly visit if you leave food open... Very Nice Park. Did have a hard time finding site. Beautiful with the changing seasons. Beach is man made and not swimmable but unnecessary for enjoyment. It's beautiful and well run. Available as wedding venue as well. Good site but had too clean up garbage Camp sites were great the beach was not. Nice park for gatherings and faux camping. Lake water is disgusting. Clean facility though. Really nice park, the camp sites are super private and the lake and beaches are really good. Beaches are clean and big and here is also a large pool. The reason why I give 4 stars is because the lake is unfortunately not safe to swim in ... It's a nice place I think they could have some more maps and a cleaner lake but for everything else it's really nice and pretty Its the best park so far i have been to. It has almost everything. You can canoe there, barbecue, a good looking beach, some bridge crossing above the beautiful small lake, hiking and cycling can also be done, including camping and if you forgot something you can go buy them from the nearest plaza which is only 5 min drive. Considered dredging the six inches of mud off of the 4 ft Deep Lake and maybe there won't be so many f ringworm f infections. Large beaches, inland lake. A giant pool.
Modern facilities, laundry, comfort stations, ball diamonds, amphitheatre. 
Also, well marked hiking trails.

Popular destination in the summer.
Though, the lake usually closes to swimming in Aug due to the stagnant water. It's an amazing place I've ever seen. Great place to go for family camping. The location is not far from some big stores like canadian tire, etc. IMHO, it is worth to give a try and experience it yourself. Recommended..!! Water and beach need improvement. More garbage bins would be nice. Very nice...clean. Love camping here. Can't wait for next season. Full amenities and lots of trails. But part if you forget something. Alliston town is a short 10 min drive away. So clean very cozy and great camp site. There could have been more shade and the wood they sell is kind of a joke. Doesn't burn very well. PS buy your own Beautiful place .. I love it. Amazing place for camping and for daily use clean beach Lake was contaminated (no swimming) but at least they have a pool (although the pool costs extra). Very good park for families. I love the sites. You get a good mixture of sun and shade. So depending on when you go ie... spring, summer or fall; you pick in advance the site you need. It's perfect. It has a little lake, boat rentals,fishing, bridges, a dam, fish ladder and trails to explore. Highly recommend you check it out  We loved this park. Great privacy. Bathrooms well kept. Too bad the lake has bad water quality and you can't swim in it because the beaches are amazing. It's nice that there is a pool though. Fun place to camp with friends Very nice beach area Not enough places to visit compare to the fee you pay. The park is really nice for family outing. If you are a group and want to spend a whole day then it would be a perfect place to enjoy. There is beach area in that they have two volleyball net which is added advantage. Was one of the best camp sites I've been to. Very large field and very clean washrooms in the park. Would definitely go again. Fantastic!  it was early in the season  and were only a couple of other tent up The sites are huge. The beach was closed due to possible ecoli levels. The huge wading pool was overcrowded because of that and the water was too cold. Very scenic. The instruction to the campsite in not clear, and one of the washroom / shower need to upgrade at ""Westsite"" Had a great time camping,  the swimming pool was great Huge, full service, family-friendly park. Nice place for Camp site, just 5 mins drive you'll find everything. Very helpful camp site staff and washroom are clean.
Very safe swimming pool with life guards. Great park great sites. Nice get away location Amazing place to camp Should clean up the park Very nice, clean park! My little one enjoyed walking around and playing at their playground! Was a wonderful day! Some lovely spots, but confusing layout takes away from the enjoyment. Not easy to get around. Great place to be outside. The 'lake' is rank, so if you plan on swimming make sure the pool is open. One of our favourite parks for early season camping, when its too cool to swim. Beach is beautiful, but completely covered in goose droppings. They have a large puddle style pool, but it always seems dirty. Excellent park lots to do and see This is a nice quiet park where there is water you can swim Peaceful spot to get away Great programs for kids, the pool was actually awesome (with lifeguards), just watch out for lurking campers that take pictures of you and call the warden. Yeah, creepy. I was cutting a sharp dead branch at eye-level off a tree where my ... Love camping here. We typically camp in the sites across the road so they are quieter.The park is busy on the weekend but typically the people are friendly. My only complaint is paying for damp firewood.  Nice place to camp for the weekend Nice park with nice sites.  Has a huge pool and a massive picnic area.  I would certainly visit here again. One of the best provincial parks in GTA . Great facilities too... including a huge pool and splash play area... tonns of picnic area and grilling area....  also boating is allowed .. moreover huge beach area as well for those kids to make same castles.!!  
in short... AMAZING place..!!  We enjoyed camping and it was my first time. But the only problem we have is the camping site warden, he keeps coming back to tell us no excessive noise, music and that our tarp is not properly done,etc. Etc. Etc.... and the worst is ... Muddy bike ride to the look out great place. Its a great place for families to have fun. The water smells like duck poop because it is inhabited by ducks. But if you're into nature smells, then its the right place. In all seriousness, I had a really great time when I went there. I would recommend it. We went for a hike, great views from the lookout! It's a nice park! Good : Amazing pool, kids will love it. 
Canoe rental available. 
Friendly staff 
Town just a whisker away, Canadian Tire, FreshCo, Tim Hortons, gas station just a three minute drive. 

Bad: Lake smells bad and water is so dirty it would be horrible to swim there.  Great for family camping. Terrible beach but there is a great pool we had a great time on camping and I would suggest for my friend to be seen this park :nice picnik areas, sound beach ares, kids playground,a lot of trails to bike or hiking!! A huge place! It would have been 5 stars if the water was swim-able, or since ""lake"" is closed it should be free for campers. It's a beautiful park but in need of an up date the playground is defenetly from the 80's
Not much to do  Good place , amazing for beginers!! Tge only downside the watter is to dirty and you cant swim in it Nice place to camp close to GTA, the outdoor swimming pool is amazing. Gets a bit croudy on weekends. Overall a great experience. Great for one day picnic or a few days of camping event. The lake is not the best and seemed little stale and dirty. Has lots of trail for trekking and biking.  We had a nice stay it was a quick stop after a long day at wonderland. Hope to stay longer next time We had lots of fun the day was hot but there was not a place to eat like to buy food  I went with my friends. The campsite was well maintained and the washroom was very clean. But, there weren't enough bush and trees to completely separate us from our neighbour. Overall, it was a great place to have a fun weekend! Nice park. Great place to bring family.  Fishing, camping, swimming and hiking areas on site. Love this place, so much to do and ample facilities for a provincial park! They have bike and canoe rentals, and ice cream! Can't wait to go again, fresh air, carry your food/drink, just pay $14.50 for parking! Where else can you enjoy your day for that? :) Greats camping swimming is terrible. Has hiking trails. Sites are large and wooded. Fire pits and picnic tables at each site. Group picnicking available. Well groomed beaches. Didn't realize how big park was. The trails are great. I haven't tried the water or the camping as it's past the season Earl Rowe park is a great place to enjoy a few days of camping, there is plenty of space on the campsites, it's kept very clean, there is a swimming pool and you can rent a canoe or paddle boat for the lake, the only bad thing about it is the water isn't safe to swim in. Love this park!  Clean washrooms!  Large sites! Excellent for family gathering Had a great birthday Hands down my favorite campground. Great place to walk around,take the dogs around most weekends...shame other dog owners don't 'pick up' after theirs!! Been going group camping for the last 10 years. Love the site. Love camping but can't swim in the lake, outdoor pool very crowded Nice park. Dirty washrooms. Bad cleaning staff. Is this place best place ever visited.  Its good for out door campaign with family get-together.  Also has beautiful swimming 🏊 pool 🎱.  It was nice I stayed at camp ground Heydon Way site 123 it was spacious and nice and private. Cute little chipmunk came and kept us company. My friends liked that it was still close to civilization and they could go to Tim Hortons in the ... Good park.  Little close to rail tracks They conveniently tell you after you pay the entrance fee of $14 that the water has high bacteria and there is no swimming. Everything was disappointing for me. Nice park to have a BBQ, but not so great to go canoeing/swimming. Really impressed with this great park! Booked a last minute campsite, very surprised to be able to get one. Never been before, very impressed with the campground and site (Riverside, Heydon Way). Enjoyed the walks over to the beach and ... The sites are the only thing that saves this campground. Paddling in this lake is 'use at own risk' so much goose #$$#$. The fishing is non existent except during the very short trout and salmon runs. my fav camping site and my 1st golfing ...loved it It was awesome. My family and I enjoyed it.  Nice sized campsites, clean washrooms and showers and helpful staff.  Love it here.. Beautiful and peaceful in the winter.  Ideal for dog walking.  Unfortunate that so much dog poop was not picked up Swimming conditions in lake are based on water quality. They have a nice swimming pool and numerous picnic areas. Beautiful place. Lots to do. Public washrooms could be a bit cleaner but we were there on a busy weekend so understandable.  Too civilized and crowded for camping. I suppose this comes with being so close to the GTA. Coming for a day is an option, if you don't mind sharing the tiny beach with a gazillion of other people. Great location close to Toronto.  Lots of open space. My boyfriend and I  like to go on a yearly camping trip every year and this year we chose Earl Rowe - and with great results. We reserved our camp site online with the Ontario Parks reservation guide. There were pictures of our site and ... We did not enjoy ourselves at all 9 people on 2 sites! this is a year end trip that we look forward to start the summer off right! The beach area is atrocious...It should be mentioned when booking...I'm not one to read reviews nor write ... Perfect place for beginner/light campers.  I used to love camping here,. Now that I've been to other provincial parks, I will never be back. I really enjoy Earl Rowe, the staff is very friendly. We had two small issues: placement of fire pit and the way the campsite flooded in the rain.  Amazing service What a great little gem near Toronto. We stayed a day & night on our way back to Toronto with an RV. VERY friendly staff, clean, HUGE camping pitches. We were sorry we had to leave, we would definitely have enjoyed a couple more days here to relax. Great provincial park. Shame you cannot really swim in the lake, but the pool is nice. Very beautiful park! However the man made lake smells like a swamp! Meow. Awesome park Beautiful park with outstanding beach areas, however the water was disgusting Had a army cadet training here and we have to canoeing on a lake fulfilled with Canada goose poop Very beautiful park! Enjoy the picnic!  It's a nice clean park,clean beach and a pool Great spot for camping, very private and well placed facilities, lots of stuff to do for the kids from swimming, and fishing, to park organized activities, and hiking! Beautiful park Good place, but miniatures road signs and lack of them make you hard to find any places.  Campground is still within noise and light pollution distance of the cities, and the lake is incredibly dirty with goose waste... So much so that there's even a huge swimming pool to swim in instead. Not what I look for in campgrounds, wouldn't ever go back. Had a great walk to the lookout! A great picnic location to go with friends and enjoy a BBQ or just a good quality time out in the nature. Excellent place to take in Ontario! Beautiful park great for family camping great park for a short trip Beautiful place to enjoy with the family. Good park and nice hiking Good camping grounds, but the beach is nothing special. Water is muddy. People camping are still expected to pay for the pool. Good camp site close to Toronto Nice place, but the beach can be crowded during the weekends. This was my fourth time camping, but as a family (my mom, dad, friend and little brother) this was our first time. The beginning was somewhat shaky, we had gone onto the webpage, and although it said that it had canoe rentals and ... Nice campground for group camping. Clean facilities and only within an hour from Toronto  Nice park that was piecfull and a good beach.  Very  Scenic and Outdoor swimming pool  This place is awesome. Have been going here since I was a baby.  It's got everything u need for a family  day picnicking. Paid 15 for a day use. I'll  be back to do some fishing.  Great Park. Nice sites. Beach... Don't go for that.  Pool is huge, park was very well maintained It's my wife 1st time to camp and she is happy Nice place to get away Very nice park with a beach as well Awesome Park to spend some family time !! The park wasn't clean and it was Foul smelling all over the place .

Water not so good but okay for boating.. Around $15 at entrance A nice place to visit for one day, not very recommend for camping. All campsites should have a clean lake where campers can swim or just be around the beach area. This is a whole business. They ensure the lake looks so unattractive that ... Surprisingly great campground for its location. Private spots, big lake fishing or bike around . big pool for kids of all ages. Great location. Would definitely go back Getting a bit run down but all in all a good place to camp, swim, hike... campsites are big enough that two or three tents would fit easily in each campsite. You can hike or canoeing too.In terms of campsite privacy is really good too. Perhaps not as good as ArrowHead Park if you have been there but definitely  better than most other place. Plus that it is very close to the city. Nice park close to Toronto. Good picnic areas. Very nice walking trails. Get park. Big. Lots of parking space. Kids loved the pool. Able to BBQ.
Great pinic spot for large family gathering. Great picnic and camping site. Lots of easy trails and good for dogs to go on a walk. Parking was $15 on the weekend. Great place to camp! Not too far from the city. Clean, friendly staff. Family fun!! We come every year. I found riverside was the only area with the really scenic sites, but only a few sites had a good view of the river, which was my biggest disappointment. The lake is nice, but if you don't plan to swim or stay for a picnic, it's not that ... Great park to camp. The water is great for a couple hour paddle. Lots of geese and their waste though🤭 I love the pool here! It's humongous and perfect for all family members. Lots of fun memories here as a kid, always something going on for the kids to do and the pool is very nice👍 Fresh coat of paint in the pool too. Sites are fairly big and nice. Close to Alliston for shops and food and whatnot We're currently camping here at Earl Rowe in the Heydon Way area.  I'm giving 3 stars because overall our experience has been great.  The bathrooms are kept reasonably clean and stocked, sites are nice and ours has enough privacy. ... Been camping there since i was a fetus (literally) my favorite provincial park! Used to camp here as a child and it was my first time back! Loved the camp grounds very clean they have a big pool .you do have to pay $3.25 per adult and $2.75 per child but it's a good alternative to the lake. Nice campground with large sites. Too bad the Lake is gross. Perfect park for camping, fishing and just relaxing. Big size campsites. Not far from Toronto. Great place to introduce our little one to camping. Friendly staff, nice sites.  Was a little disappointed that we weren't able to get into the water at the beach. Nice but short day of fishing (weather related) will definately come again to explore Beautiful campground with many large sites. Beaches have been taken over by geese. Use the pool. Bathrooms and showers are clean. Frendily staff, nice sites.  Didn't get a chance to check out the beach though. Terrible!!!!!! This park is a joke !!! 
we are in the handy cap spot so my husband has access to the showers as he has a Hard time walking far distances. Yes he is a handicapped flacker holder!!... the shower that is for handicapped was ... Fantastic group site. Nice amenities near by. Swimming pool is a bonus. Could be a wonderful park, but it has been so  overrun by geese and seagulls that the only swimming option is to pay to use the pool. Great place for walking and BBQ. The lake is contaminated with bacteria and it is not safe for swimming. Great camping park with very good facilities. It is a shame the lake is always polluted. Maybe something could be done about or it could be stocked with fish for kids to catch. Great comfortable place great if you have kids or dogs with lots to do Less crowded, nice swimming pool, good trail - bacteria and algae full beach Took my grandson to a ""learn to fish program"" it was excellent. I did not enjoy my experience at all during the time I was at Earl Rowe. I don't even know where to start. We go to checkin and we are told we need to go to the other side of the street because we are in Riverside. This is absolutely ... Never coming back. Not enough patrols and don't do anything about people from other sites walking through yours. People throw garbage all over the place. Worst provincial park ever. And shining headlights of there cars into your site from theirs. Best and beautiful place.  Greatly. Had a nice lots neighbors were nice Smallish park, reasonable facilities. Check water conditions before going due to occasional beach closures. Nice scenery. No natural water lake system to swim in but there is a pool that you have to pay to get into. This is a great walking park many great trails to walk whether it is beside the pond or by the dam or even along the river there is something for everyone. There are also many camping spots that are a little more private you do not have to be directly on top of other campers. Great camping, close to the city and we had a fantastic time our family  will be back again. It's a nice place for camping but the camping spot is a little bit open, less private. Enjoyed are time there, nice big private sights Lovely Provincial Park, dog friendly (even on one of the beaches! 🙌), new-looking comfort stations/washrooms & showers. Pit toilets are still the pits.

Rainbow Run trail is an unusual but nice trail to hike - not much elevation, ... Went for camping on the canada day long weekend, good place, but don’t expect to have much at the beach as the water quality was really bad and there were bird poops every where! Very smelly! I've spent the last 18 years in this park during all 4 seasons. I love it and it feels like a part of me! Nice big beach area, and nobody was there because unfortunately the water was not safe to swim in. You have to pay to use the pool, which is ridiculous. Camp sites in Trillium campground seem to be bigger and have more trees.b It was a good park, but recommending swimming in the park. Great for picnics. Great park for kids. River wasn't great because of the bird flock leftovers - yuck Very good place to go for camping. Facility is awesome, electricity, shower, washroom are all available on site.  the only thing that I think is negtive is that the site thay we stay at were bit far from the lake and wd had to drive for 5minutes for that. Clean sites. Lots to do for kids. Awesome place to go friendly sraff and trails kept clear stayed in fletcher and spots were big 😃 definetly goin again Very nice place to go camping but not the best Good if you like the convenience of being close to a town for supplies. It does not have clean natural water to go in; instead there is a big swimming pool that they charge you do use. It doesn't really feel like camping with all the ... This place has gone down hill ever since i was a kid. The water is terrible they keep failing water tests. I would pass on this place and camp somewhere else. You would think that because the lake has ecoli that they would make the pool free, but no they charge you more to use it on top of day fees and camping fees Very nice park.  Great place to camp, fish and ride bikes.  An all round place to enjoy the outdoors. Besides being eaten alive, we enjoyed our 3 day weekend here and will return. My daughter and I camped here the other night, and had a great time. 
Pros: The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The afternoon activities at the visitor center were fun and educational for kids. The park is well maintained, ... Great family location. Well maintained Close to GTA campground with nice hiking trails. This park seems to be better suited for camping than others I've seen so far. Sites are separated way more from each other, so from our site I was able to hear others (good for safety) but not see them (good for privacy). I was ... Friendly staff and great campsite. just bring some OFF spray for the mosquitoes Amazing park for picnic and a huge pool for swim lovers A very nice provincial park for all activities Had a lot of fun here with some friends. We got a little rowdy late at night and the park officer was very understanding and patient. The only downside was the lake was literally surrounded by goose poo, the first 5 feet of water was just pure poop.  Very nice park. Swimming in the man-made lake is awful, but the pool is terrific, and the price is good. $3.75 for adult admission to the pool. Plenty of picnic tables and canoe & kayak rentals. Food trucks, too. Great place for a fun day.  We go every year and we always have a great time. great place for camping lots of bugs
they stick a handicap person way out in the back 40 1st visit, loved it, bathrooms were in much better shape than expected, clean and neat camp grounds. No bad campers made the experience pretty awesome. Did not like that the lake is not swim friendly, it was too cold to try the pool. ... A great place for camping.. thoroughly enjoyed. Place is well equipped with wash rooms and there are showers with hot water running throughout the day... Be aware of racoons in the night. They certainly visit if you leave food open... Very Nice Park. Did have a hard time finding site. Beautiful with the changing seasons. Beach is man made and not swimmable but unnecessary for enjoyment. It's beautiful and well run. Available as wedding venue as well. Good site but had too clean up garbage Camp sites were great the beach was not. Nice park for gatherings and faux camping. Lake water is disgusting. Clean facility though. Really nice park, the camp sites are super private and the lake and beaches are really good. Beaches are clean and big and here is also a large pool. The reason why I give 4 stars is because the lake is unfortunately not safe to swim in ... It's a nice place I think they could have some more maps and a cleaner lake but for everything else it's really nice and pretty Its the best park so far i have been to. It has almost everything. You can canoe there, barbecue, a good looking beach, some bridge crossing above the beautiful small lake, hiking and cycling can also be done, including camping and if you forgot something you can go buy them from the nearest plaza which is only 5 min drive. Considered dredging the six inches of mud off of the 4 ft Deep Lake and maybe there won't be so many f ringworm f infections. Large beaches, inland lake. A giant pool.
Modern facilities, laundry, comfort stations, ball diamonds, amphitheatre. 
Also, well marked hiking trails.

Popular destination in the summer.
Though, the lake usually closes to swimming in Aug due to the stagnant water. It's an amazing place I've ever seen. Great place to go for family camping. The location is not far from some big stores like canadian tire, etc. IMHO, it is worth to give a try and experience it yourself. Recommended..!! Water and beach need improvement. More garbage bins would be nice. Very nice...clean. Love camping here. Can't wait for next season. Full amenities and lots of trails. But part if you forget something. Alliston town is a short 10 min drive away. So clean very cozy and great camp site. There could have been more shade and the wood they sell is kind of a joke. Doesn't burn very well. PS buy your own Beautiful place .. I love it. Amazing place for camping and for daily use clean beach Lake was contaminated (no swimming) but at least they have a pool (although the pool costs extra). Very good park for families. I love the sites. You get a good mixture of sun and shade. So depending on when you go ie... spring, summer or fall; you pick in advance the site you need. It's perfect. It has a little lake, boat rentals,fishing, bridges, a dam, fish ladder and trails to explore. Highly recommend you check it out  We loved this park. Great privacy. Bathrooms well kept. Too bad the lake has bad water quality and you can't swim in it because the beaches are amazing. It's nice that there is a pool though. Fun place to camp with friends Very nice beach area Not enough places to visit compare to the fee you pay. The park is really nice for family outing. If you are a group and want to spend a whole day then it would be a perfect place to enjoy. There is beach area in that they have two volleyball net which is added advantage. Was one of the best camp sites I've been to. Very large field and very clean washrooms in the park. Would definitely go again. Fantastic!  it was early in the season  and were only a couple of other tent up The sites are huge. The beach was closed due to possible ecoli levels. The huge wading pool was overcrowded because of that and the water was too cold. Very scenic. The instruction to the campsite in not clear, and one of the washroom / shower need to upgrade at ""Westsite"" Had a great time camping,  the swimming pool was great Huge, full service, family-friendly park. Nice place for Camp site, just 5 mins drive you'll find everything. Very helpful camp site staff and washroom are clean.
Very safe swimming pool with life guards. Great park great sites. Nice get away location Amazing place to camp Should clean up the park Very nice, clean park! My little one enjoyed walking around and playing at their playground! Was a wonderful day! Some lovely spots, but confusing layout takes away from the enjoyment. Not easy to get around. Great place to be outside. The 'lake' is rank, so if you plan on swimming make sure the pool is open. One of our favourite parks for early season camping, when its too cool to swim. Beach is beautiful, but completely covered in goose droppings. They have a large puddle style pool, but it always seems dirty. Excellent park lots to do and see This is a nice quiet park where there is water you can swim Peaceful spot to get away Great programs for kids, the pool was actually awesome (with lifeguards), just watch out for lurking campers that take pictures of you and call the warden. Yeah, creepy. I was cutting a sharp dead branch at eye-level off a tree where my ... Love camping here. We typically camp in the sites across the road so they are quieter.The park is busy on the weekend but typically the people are friendly. My only complaint is paying for damp firewood.  Nice place to camp for the weekend Nice park with nice sites.  Has a huge pool and a massive picnic area.  I would certainly visit here again. One of the best provincial parks in GTA . Great facilities too... including a huge pool and splash play area... tonns of picnic area and grilling area....  also boating is allowed .. moreover huge beach area as well for those kids to make same castles.!!  
in short... AMAZING place..!!  We enjoyed camping and it was my first time. But the only problem we have is the camping site warden, he keeps coming back to tell us no excessive noise, music and that our tarp is not properly done,etc. Etc. Etc.... and the worst is ... Muddy bike ride to the look out great place. Its a great place for families to have fun. The water smells like duck poop because it is inhabited by ducks. But if you're into nature smells, then its the right place. In all seriousness, I had a really great time when I went there. I would recommend it. We went for a hike, great views from the lookout! It's a nice park! Good : Amazing pool, kids will love it. 
Canoe rental available. 
Friendly staff 
Town just a whisker away, Canadian Tire, FreshCo, Tim Hortons, gas station just a three minute drive. 

Bad: Lake smells bad and water is so dirty it would be horrible to swim there.  Great for family camping. Terrible beach but there is a great pool we had a great time on camping and I would suggest for my friend to be seen this park :nice picnik areas, sound beach ares, kids playground,a lot of trails to bike or hiking!! A huge place! It would have been 5 stars if the water was swim-able, or since ""lake"" is closed it should be free for campers. It's a beautiful park but in need of an up date the playground is defenetly from the 80's
Not much to do  Good place , amazing for beginers!! Tge only downside the watter is to dirty and you cant swim in it Nice place to camp close to GTA, the outdoor swimming pool is amazing. Gets a bit croudy on weekends. Overall a great experience. Great for one day picnic or a few days of camping event. The lake is not the best and seemed little stale and dirty. Has lots of trail for trekking and biking.  We had a nice stay it was a quick stop after a long day at wonderland. Hope to stay longer next time We had lots of fun the day was hot but there was not a place to eat like to buy food  I went with my friends. The campsite was well maintained and the washroom was very clean. But, there weren't enough bush and trees to completely separate us from our neighbour. Overall, it was a great place to have a fun weekend! Nice park. Great place to bring family.  Fishing, camping, swimming and hiking areas on site. Love this place, so much to do and ample facilities for a provincial park! They have bike and canoe rentals, and ice cream! Can't wait to go again, fresh air, carry your food/drink, just pay $14.50 for parking! Where else can you enjoy your day for that? :) Greats camping swimming is terrible. Has hiking trails. Sites are large and wooded. Fire pits and picnic tables at each site. Group picnicking available. Well groomed beaches. Didn't realize how big park was. The trails are great. I haven't tried the water or the camping as it's past the season Earl Rowe park is a great place to enjoy a few days of camping, there is plenty of space on the campsites, it's kept very clean, there is a swimming pool and you can rent a canoe or paddle boat for the lake, the only bad thing about it is the water isn't safe to swim in. Love this park!  Clean washrooms!  Large sites! Excellent for family gathering Had a great birthday Hands down my favorite campground. Great place to walk around,take the dogs around most weekends...shame other dog owners don't 'pick up' after theirs!! Been going group camping for the last 10 years. Love the site. Love camping but can't swim in the lake, outdoor pool very crowded Nice park. Dirty washrooms. Bad cleaning staff. Is this place best place ever visited.  Its good for out door campaign with family get-together.  Also has beautiful swimming 🏊 pool 🎱.  It was nice I stayed at camp ground Heydon Way site 123 it was spacious and nice and private. Cute little chipmunk came and kept us company. My friends liked that it was still close to civilization and they could go to Tim Hortons in the ... Good park.  Little close to rail tracks They conveniently tell you after you pay the entrance fee of $14 that the water has high bacteria and there is no swimming. Everything was disappointing for me. Nice park to have a BBQ, but not so great to go canoeing/swimming. Really impressed with this great park! Booked a last minute campsite, very surprised to be able to get one. Never been before, very impressed with the campground and site (Riverside, Heydon Way). Enjoyed the walks over to the beach and ... The sites are the only thing that saves this campground. Paddling in this lake is 'use at own risk' so much goose #$$#$. The fishing is non existent except during the very short trout and salmon runs. my fav camping site and my 1st golfing ...loved it It was awesome. My family and I enjoyed it.  Nice sized campsites, clean washrooms and showers and helpful staff.  Love it here.. Beautiful and peaceful in the winter.  Ideal for dog walking.  Unfortunate that so much dog poop was not picked up Swimming conditions in lake are based on water quality. They have a nice swimming pool and numerous picnic areas. Beautiful place. Lots to do. Public washrooms could be a bit cleaner but we were there on a busy weekend so understandable.  Too civilized and crowded for camping. I suppose this comes with being so close to the GTA. Coming for a day is an option, if you don't mind sharing the tiny beach with a gazillion of other people. Great location close to Toronto.  Lots of open space. My boyfriend and I  like to go on a yearly camping trip every year and this year we chose Earl Rowe - and with great results. We reserved our camp site online with the Ontario Parks reservation guide. There were pictures of our site and ... We did not enjoy ourselves at all 9 people on 2 sites! this is a year end trip that we look forward to start the summer off right! The beach area is atrocious...It should be mentioned when booking...I'm not one to read reviews nor write ... Perfect place for beginner/light campers.  I used to love camping here,. Now that I've been to other provincial parks, I will never be back. I really enjoy Earl Rowe, the staff is very friendly. We had two small issues: placement of fire pit and the way the campsite flooded in the rain.  Amazing service What a great little gem near Toronto. We stayed a day & night on our way back to Toronto with an RV. VERY friendly staff, clean, HUGE camping pitches. We were sorry we had to leave, we would definitely have enjoyed a couple more days here to relax. Great provincial park. Shame you cannot really swim in the lake, but the pool is nice. Very beautiful park! However the man made lake smells like a swamp! Meow. Awesome park Beautiful park with outstanding beach areas, however the water was disgusting Had a army cadet training here and we have to canoeing on a lake fulfilled with Canada goose poop Very beautiful park! Enjoy the picnic!  It's a nice clean park,clean beach and a pool Great spot for camping, very private and well placed facilities, lots of stuff to do for the kids from swimming, and fishing, to park organized activities, and hiking! Beautiful park Good place, but miniatures road signs and lack of them make you hard to find any places.  Campground is still within noise and light pollution distance of the cities, and the lake is incredibly dirty with goose waste... So much so that there's even a huge swimming pool to swim in instead. Not what I look for in campgrounds, wouldn't ever go back. Had a great walk to the lookout! A great picnic location to go with friends and enjoy a BBQ or just a good quality time out in the nature. Excellent place to take in Ontario! Beautiful park great for family camping great park for a short trip Beautiful place to enjoy with the family. Good park and nice hiking Good camping grounds, but the beach is nothing special. Water is muddy. People camping are still expected to pay for the pool. Good camp site close to Toronto Nice place, but the beach can be crowded during the weekends. This was my fourth time camping, but as a family (my mom, dad, friend and little brother) this was our first time. The beginning was somewhat shaky, we had gone onto the webpage, and although it said that it had canoe rentals and ... Nice campground for group camping. Clean facilities and only within an hour from Toronto  Nice park that was piecfull and a good beach.  Very  Scenic and Outdoor swimming pool  This place is awesome. Have been going here since I was a baby.  It's got everything u need for a family  day picnicking. Paid 15 for a day use. I'll  be back to do some fishing.  Great Park. Nice sites. Beach... Don't go for that.  Pool is huge, park was very well maintained It's my wife 1st time to camp and she is happy Nice place to get away Very nice park with a beach as well Awesome Park to spend some family time !! The park wasn't clean and it was Foul smelling all over the place . 
we couldn't even swim due to smell.

Please watch out if your choosing this park. Great family camping! Nice Provincial Park,  45 minutes away from Toronto Beautiful clean park Had a great time. Very clean.  Awesome tenting and trailer sites, clean bathrooms.  Nice Beach, Accessible Trail nice beach, neat and clean. Camped there years ago Very nice park for camping Great spot for a  hike One of the best veiw at the top of the hill  Superb Good spot, clean facilities We love it here Nice shallow pool for kids.

Came here as a kid and brought my family here in June of 2018. Pigeon river is very weedy for fishing but if you find a spot you can get some nice fish bass/musky. Facilities were clean and the beach was consistently ranked in the mornings. Awesome dock for your boat/fishing as well. Nice park to visit during summer months. Charcoal Barbecue is allowed. Children’s play area is nearby the water. I had a fantastic time at Emily park. Was there for 6 nights with 3 kids ages 8 to 10. They enjoyed their time at the south beach, swimming, fishing and walking the short trails. Truly speaking, the park and what it has to offer is good. ... Have been going here since my childhood and it's a fantastic park for camping. The trails are great, they've done lots of work on them.  Every campsite has decent privacy on at least 2 sides from my experience. Washrooms are always in ... We had a great experience at Emily park. I think it definitely depends on what type of camping you're looking for. We could hear a lot of other people but the wardens must have done a good job as they mostly quieted down shortly after ... Our family enjoyed the beach (there's 2 small ones to choose from), and the playground, but we really appreciated the shows and activities that were put on by staff.  Shower/toilet facilities were relatively clean too.  Will return again. Love this park. The washrooms we are using are some of the best we've experienced. Love that there's place for all your stuff and sufficient hangers! Staff are awesome as well. Very polite and helpful. Clean park as expected from most provincial parks. The staff are very nice. The sites were ok. Our site was great. Large with a decent amount of tree cover but some people in our party had sites that weren't as private. The beach was ... PLEASE READ.
Remember you are in nature's back yard.
Site 211 has a permanent thief that lives and steals. Yes, this is not a joke.
Red squirrel steals lighters, keys, buns, or anything you may need under your screened In gazebo. Don't hurt him or them. They don't know any better. Nice clean place with family-friendly activities and friendly staff. One thing that is needed is a few more informative directional signs to key areas like the Beaches and Convenience Store. I helped someone looking for the convenience ... Stayed here for a few days in August 2018.  Staff are absolutely amazing.  The site we stayed at (#307) was huge, but had a pretty hefty slope to it.  I had run out of 6x6 to try to level out the trailer.  I asked staff at the front of ... Spent 3 nights at Emily in August. Its a fairly large campground. Has equipment rentals, a parks store of course, and the two boat launches are very well kept, with new docks and parking lots. Great little park. Close by to a city. Clean facilities, tons of programs for younger kids. The beach area was nice, but the 'sand' was more clay like, kids enjoyed getting dirty and building things. Needs an EV charger. Really nice park but they need to have a nice place for dogs to swim. Currently they can only go in the water at boat launches which are weedy and dirty. Staff are friendly and helpful, sites are private and beautiful. We stayed on circle and it was great. We cant wait to go back. Lovely campground - very private.  Our campsite (108) was also very nice.  However, we had heavy rain our first night, and quickly discovered that we were at the lowest point in the park - rain run-off from three different roads flowed ... The beach is full of algae and water is not as clean as the southern part of Toronto beaches. The camp is not big and easy to go around on bike. Camp staff is very friendly and helpful. Washroom and shower room are cleaned frequently. We stayed on RV site and overall is quiet. Yes go there every year for a Family reunion annually on the September Long Weekend.  The guy at the front desk this past year was ignorant and really was not helpful in anyway and directed us in the wrong direction to the open Family ... I really like camping at emily park. The sites are nice and big and the beach is nice for the grandchildren. Unfortunately I can't take my dog on the beach even though I always pick up after him. But those who don't spoil it for those who do. The staff are very friendly and the park is very clean. Super clean with great showers. Walking trail is very short but the boardwalk is finally being rebuilt. This is my first time camping at Emily Provincial Park. Campground is very nice. Bathrooms are modern and are fairly clean with a large amount of shower capacity, 7 shower stalls where I was at. I've read other reviews about the beach ... Overall decent experience good staff at the gate and terrific staff at the parks store, but we were on the same group site as we have been on for the last several years, and they still haven't fixed one of the washrooms that's been out ... The park is smaller compared to other provincial parks and it has two nice beaches , however no dogs are allowed on the beach. We stayed at one of the group campsites and it was beautiful however there were only two comfort stations for a campground with 320 campsites so be prepared to line up especially on a long weekend. If you get to the park too early, meaning before anyone in the booth is there. Look out for the pay area and place your slip on the dash. Was there a few ago fishing, didn't see any pay spot, so went into the park, figured I would pay on ... They made renting a canoe for the afternoon very easy. I will definitely be back to see more of the river. We are regular campers at Emily. Love the size of the park. Love the beach. Our young kids always have a blast. Great place to camp. Most spots are good sized. Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean bathrooms. 2 beaches and boat launch little store. Stayed 2 nights June 2018. Huge site #286! Quiet at night. A little noise from nearby highway. Staff were all friendly and helpful. New upgrades to some roads and the dump and fill stations. Definitely book here again. The RV sites are beautiful, the staff very friendly and efficient. I have never seen such fabulous fill aand dump stations.

  I found the ladies ""outhouse?"" by the centre beach deplorable. It was dirty and because I was desperate I used ... This is the most amazing provincial park. It's so beautiful. The beach is amazing for campers. The public use beach is ok but still pretty good. The playground for kids is really neat. Definitely worth the trip. Usually only go here for the group sites. Has many differnnt water fun things for rent like paddle boats and canoes. Waterfront nice, sites a good size. Bug free this mid Aug weekend. No water connection @sites. Nice big private campsites. Water taps are almost inside the campsite and is shared between 2 or 3 other campsites. I have camped at Emily Provincial Park a few times each year.  It has a nice beach for children to play and docks setup to allow campers and children to fish, which I haven't found at many provincial parks.  I have always camped on the ... Clean facilities and a nice beach. I really liked this campsite and the hiking trails (although they were short) Not a bad place, but not worth a long drive just for camping. Just an every day place. Good park, busy and small. Nice area and good for boats though. Bathrooms could be redone as they're showing their age. Had a terrific weekend, as part of a campaign. Heard from other folks at the park that it's better than other provincial  parks around the East end. Used to be a great park. Now wardens must have have something better to do at nights. Drinking and yelling all night with adults peeing all over their sites. Bad experience this time 😠 Not a bad camp site the staff try to keep everything clean, except the beach need some work.

We went labour day weekend this year, and it was a waste of ... Nice campsite. Lots of activities for kids. Just wish there are more showers for each camp ground. Beautiful clean park a true must stay provincial park The park was nice and quiet.camping site was nice but small dinky beaches,water was dirty I am only giving them a 1 star because there isn’t the option to give none. 
Rudest staff ever. 
The moment we got to the camp we had 2 vehicles and on the website it said 2 are free but you have to pay for a third they made up pay even ... I'm here at the moment, super disappointed and extremely angry with myself because I booked this weekend without making enough research.

I go camping to be in the nature, to be away from the city lights and noises. At the moment I'm in ...

Hiking is limited (you're better off exiting ... The best camping trip......so far😉 Wasnt here just close bye Great staff, Friendly, cleanest facilities I've ever been to at a provincial park campground. Great park, nice big sites, great beaches It's a very small provical park. With only one beach area. The water is not the best for swimming. It's good if u just want a quick weekend getaway or if u have small children, since the swimming area is very shallow with a sandy beach. Clean, well maintained.  Close to GTA. Big site, beautiful pigeon river. Great for all ages Really quiet and very clean...even the bears 🐻 are friendly. Favourite park. Very clean bathroom and well kept sites. Respectable park,  very clean and beach is average. We love Emily Park, it's nice and close and we always have a great time camping there. My first time ever going camping, and I would definately go back here again before the summer is over. Fun environment.. family campng Same friendly staff and well cared for facilities. Quiet large sites beach area not great.  Poor swimming area for dogs Emily was a nice surprise.  The park is not that big but well kept.  Our site was very private and backed onto the beach.  The beach was groomed and is great for kids.  The boat launch was well taken care of.  It had a simple but ... This place is nice but has really changed quite a bit in the last few years. The popular boardwalk nature trail was closed and the second beach was closed. It's a nice place to canoe if you but on the weekends motorboats regularly drive ... Very nice place Very nice park, good sized sites. Nice lake you can fish in ( perch) Awesome camp grounds Nice clean organized park. Quiet clean park. Plenty of activities for kids. Beach area is great. Excellent park for day and overnights.

Now, years later, I frequent the park with my own family. It is a yearly tradition for us. Park staff is wonderful, sites are a great size and comfort stations are usually clean. My kids are always excited ... Beautiful, quiet, scenic areas with the cleanest washrooms and hot shower facilities. Lots of room for tents and RV campers and laid-out hiking trails. This is a place to stay again and again. Nice park, but constant road noise. This park is great for walkers. I can easily do the entire park in one afternoon and I am quite out of shape reasonably sized ice cream washrooms are clean. Good programing if you want to stay to watch it (day passes expire at 10pm) All was good.   Exception being no pet access to water at the beach.   My dogs are better behaved then the kids running loose here Great camping spot Good place for swimming  and fishing Peacefull and clean Great park , Great Staff Excellent campsites with good privacy in the circle campground. Ontario parks camping fees are far too high $51+ / night, but I like camping in parks far more than commercial campgrounds Place is only for kids and family's.

Unfortunately it wasn't busy that ... We enjoyed camping at emily provincial park🏕⛈🌨☀️🌜🌟☔🎣🚴‍♀️🏸⚽️🚵‍♀️✨☕🍌🍓🍒🍍🍉🍔🍟🥓🍗🧀🌭🍳🍝🍜🍲🍩🍰🎂🍫🍭🍨🍧🍦🍺🍷🍸full fun with all FRIENDS COME TOGETHER😃😄😅🤣😂😆😁😍😘🤗😉😊 Nice camping place. Nice park. Good services. Lake has a lot of weeds but still good for swimming. Campsites can be a little muddy, bring a tarp. Great park, and great people. Sites are all relatively good. The beaches can be closed sometimes depending on the bacteria content of the river and the beaches are also pretty small. Joined the learn to camp program with our 3yr old son. Place is very convenient, clean washrooms and safe.
The guides were amazing (Nik and team). Friendly and knowledgeable staffs.

Place is highly recommended for kids with young children. They also have a place to fish and gears you can borrow for free. Reserved from Jun 08-11/17.  First of all, had to move from site 248 to 252 because ground too wet!  Understandable however there was a huge pile of gravel in front of our site which made it impossible to maneuver our 39' RV plus pick up ... Favourite summer time place Beach sucks not good swimming conditions but campsites are large. Very relaxing and serene camp site. Other campers are respectful and curtious. Staff are very helpful and inviting.
CPAP friendly; must bring extension cord.
Did not try any of the water activities as it was very windy. Great camping experience. Clean park. Water is weedy but beach area was great. Great place to camp. Great park. Come here every year, always clean and friendly people I camp here almost every year, and enjoy having a consistent campground that always suits our needs. Nice sites for tents, though some of the RV sites are very open/no privacy. Beaches are small but nice, and rarely busy. Fishing is good, plenty of sun fish and bass around. Nice quiet little park. Great place for time away for you and your family. I go there every summer  Overall, not a bad park.  Took just my son for 2 nights.  Fishing wasn't that great though, way too many weeds close to shore.  
We booked a campsite backing right onto the beach (#140).  It was quite convenient, but although there were cedars blocking the view between the site and beach, it was quite noisy. Too many alge and weeds in water It's close to the people who live East of Toronto. Easy to get to and staff are very friendly. It has 2 beaches and water equipment to rent plus you can borrow PDF and fishing gear. Water is nice, but a little swampy, but lots of people were in it. It has a decent beach.   Boat launch on site with lots of docks.  Decently private campsites, but the beaches are gross.. All seaweed and bacteria.. They closed one beach because of e.coli while we were there..  Super nice. Well kept One of our favorite paces to go. Especially Halloween  (thanksgiving ) weekend. Been going for this 4 years in a row. Won't ever miss one - the kids love it ! Great family park. Great place !! Great park for just a visit for the day or camping! Views are pretty good, but nice and quite area Park staff are nice...beach area are safe fir the kids but parents should watch their kids while swimming . Awesome every year I have been there

Great camping area for family kids and all Have camped many times at Emily but this year not the best, unfortunately only a couple selections for sites and the one picked was not the greatest. Party central which continued through entire night on the Friday to Saturday morning ... We have a great site, quiet. My only complaint is that to have an additional vehicle allowed in is $50+. For one night.  Just a beautiful spot. Took the kids here many years ago as toddlers and I'm so happy to be able to return clean showers and clean bathrooms. Thank you staff for hosting us very very happy Beautiful little place Great n affordable place for the family I came here to go camping and loved the fishing and area, its just down the street from peterborough so you dont need to look far for supplies or food. I managed to pull a huge 4 pounder largemouth from the docks! Fantastic place 
We had so much fun with the kids Always excellent! Sites are very big and in great shape. There is no zero star otherwise i would put that on Emily Provincial Park campground.We went as a big group  last weekend our sites were cancelled due to rain and it was really muddy and we got 1 site which was very big and other sites ... Friendly staff. Well priced and taken care of  Nice little park just a stone through away from Peterborough.  Great for a Winter walk. A real swell place to camp with friends, and summon the tree people. 3 stars due to the fact we were unable to do so on park grounds.
Would return again I've stayed here several times. It's never been too busy,  so it feels very private. The lake is beautiful and I love the Cedars loop despite the mosquitoes.  i have only been there once injoyed my stay will be going back Can't say enough good things about this park and the staff. Amazing! Provincial park i see it driving by but never been in there great staff Me and couple of our family always go here every year! Love the staff. Love how it's clean.  Good sized camping spots, nice beach. Nice park with big sites. Our camp site was located in the  circle campground, site 225. The site had uneven ground and very uncomfortable.   The upside is that the site is close to the washroom and water hole. Been camping here since 1982 with kids. Now kids camp here. Love the park. Clean, beautiful park, friendly staff,  fun swimming. Close to Linds or Peterborough. Lots to do in the area. I recommend this park to everyone. You can't please everybody.  To many restrictions. Nice A wonder full place always Great family campsite. Lots for the kids to do and see. Clean facilities and nice beaches. Ice and wood cost a bit much but it's not far to a shop to get your own. Beautiful area, camping spots have a good amount of privacy. Nice beach to swim  This is the second time our church group camping at Emily Park. We are satisfied with the facilities, services, environment, almost everything. This year I had small problem when I booked the group camping site in the spring time; the ... The park itself is great, the only downfall is year after year the cleanliness of the comfort stations is going down. The park staff try so hard to keep it clean but more and more dirty people are camping here each year, during the week it's not so bad but on weekends (more so on long weekends) it's nasty! Is very accessible for ♿ Good place to go. Kids had a blast. Staff were great. Very accommodating  Visited on July 3rd. Not good for swimming. Water looks dirty. Fairly short drive from Toronto to the park. Park was full, but there was still some privacy. The water was not great for swimming.  Great kayak fishing in the area Weather was not on our side...torrential rain this past weekend so unable to fish or swim.  Cedars campground site was small and the bathroom closest to us was foul, you had hold your breath.  There should be some lighting in the ... Nice Campsite and close to the city Worked their and very nice, open, good employes, very beautiful quiet place to camp with the family or yourself 2 nice beaches aswell. Staff was friendly and efficient. The park itself is clean and quite large with a beach, docks for fishing and canoeing. Dont waste your good money on this park for a place that has been around since 1957 im not impressed that we still have outhouses no lighting. They also allow rvs to block roads dumping waste waited over a half hr to get back to my ... The park is not big and there isn't much to do there.

Loved it and the beach was great Nice camp grounds,  not enough activities  Great park Pleasant staff, clean facilities and a nice location. We would camp here again. Park wardens are overbearing otherwise this would be a pretty good park.  The river looked a little low so we didn't launch the boat here.  The park lots and amenities were up to standard for a Provincial Park. Family comes here all the time, very private were we camp. Lots to choose from. Close to Toronto, nice sites  not a massive park but good nature.  Beautiful Trails  Great group sites Lots of fun and clean bathrooms very good for camping Dirty shallow water on the river.  Beautiful Gorgeous camp good (Translated by Google) Great park for camping, the site even has a beautiful beach. At night we can clearly see all the stars and the site is semi-wooded.

Located in the heart of the Kawarthas
Excellent fishing opportunities
Boating and paddling on the Trent Severn Waterway
Fantastic fall camping and coloursExcellent park. Came here as a kid and brought my family here in June of 2018. Pigeon river is very weedy for fishing but if you find a spot you can get some nice fish bass/musky. Facilities were clean and the beach was consistently ranked in the mornings. Awesome dock for your boat/fishing as well. Nice park to visit during summer months. Charcoal Barbecue is allowed. Children’s play area is nearby the water. I had a fantastic time at Emily park. Was there for 6 nights with 3 kids ages 8 to 10. They enjoyed their time at the south beach, swimming, fishing and walking the short trails. Truly speaking, the park and what it has to offer is good. ... Have been going here since my childhood and it's a fantastic park for camping. The trails are great, they've done lots of work on them.  Every campsite has decent privacy on at least 2 sides from my experience. Washrooms are always in ... We had a great experience at Emily park. I think it definitely depends on what type of camping you're looking for. We could hear a lot of other people but the wardens must have done a good job as they mostly quieted down shortly after ... Our family enjoyed the beach (there's 2 small ones to choose from), and the playground, but we really appreciated the shows and activities that were put on by staff.  Shower/toilet facilities were relatively clean too.  Will return again. Love this park. The washrooms we are using are some of the best we've experienced. Love that there's place for all your stuff and sufficient hangers! Staff are awesome as well. Very polite and helpful. Clean park as expected from most provincial parks. The staff are very nice. The sites were ok. Our site was great. Large with a decent amount of tree cover but some people in our party had sites that weren't as private. The beach was ... PLEASE READ.
Remember you are in nature's back yard.
Site 211 has a permanent thief that lives and steals. Yes, this is not a joke.
Red squirrel steals lighters, keys, buns, or anything you may need under your screened In gazebo. Don't hurt him or them. They don't know any better. Nice clean place with family-friendly activities and friendly staff. One thing that is needed is a few more informative directional signs to key areas like the Beaches and Convenience Store. I helped someone looking for the convenience ... Stayed here for a few days in August 2018.  Staff are absolutely amazing.  The site we stayed at (#307) was huge, but had a pretty hefty slope to it.  I had run out of 6x6 to try to level out the trailer.  I asked staff at the front of ... Spent 3 nights at Emily in August. Its a fairly large campground. Has equipment rentals, a parks store of course, and the two boat launches are very well kept, with new docks and parking lots. Great little park. Close by to a city. Clean facilities, tons of programs for younger kids. The beach area was nice, but the 'sand' was more clay like, kids enjoyed getting dirty and building things. Needs an EV charger. Really nice park but they need to have a nice place for dogs to swim. Currently they can only go in the water at boat launches which are weedy and dirty. Staff are friendly and helpful, sites are private and beautiful. We stayed on circle and it was great. We cant wait to go back. Lovely campground - very private.  Our campsite (108) was also very nice.  However, we had heavy rain our first night, and quickly discovered that we were at the lowest point in the park - rain run-off from three different roads flowed ... The beach is full of algae and water is not as clean as the southern part of Toronto beaches. The camp is not big and easy to go around on bike. Camp staff is very friendly and helpful. Washroom and shower room are cleaned frequently. We stayed on RV site and overall is quiet. Yes go there every year for a Family reunion annually on the September Long Weekend.  The guy at the front desk this past year was ignorant and really was not helpful in anyway and directed us in the wrong direction to the open Family ... I really like camping at emily park. The sites are nice and big and the beach is nice for the grandchildren. Unfortunately I can't take my dog on the beach even though I always pick up after him. But those who don't spoil it for those who do. The staff are very friendly and the park is very clean. Super clean with great showers. Walking trail is very short but the boardwalk is finally being rebuilt. This is my first time camping at Emily Provincial Park. Campground is very nice. Bathrooms are modern and are fairly clean with a large amount of shower capacity, 7 shower stalls where I was at. I've read other reviews about the beach ... Overall decent experience good staff at the gate and terrific staff at the parks store, but we were on the same group site as we have been on for the last several years, and they still haven't fixed one of the washrooms that's been out ... The park is smaller compared to other provincial parks and it has two nice beaches , however no dogs are allowed on the beach. We stayed at one of the group campsites and it was beautiful however there were only two comfort stations for a campground with 320 campsites so be prepared to line up especially on a long weekend. If you get to the park too early, meaning before anyone in the booth is there. Look out for the pay area and place your slip on the dash. Was there a few ago fishing, didn't see any pay spot, so went into the park, figured I would pay on ... They made renting a canoe for the afternoon very easy. I will definitely be back to see more of the river. We are regular campers at Emily. Love the size of the park. Love the beach. Our young kids always have a blast. Great place to camp. Most spots are good sized. Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean bathrooms. 2 beaches and boat launch little store. Stayed 2 nights June 2018. Huge site #286! Quiet at night. A little noise from nearby highway. Staff were all friendly and helpful. New upgrades to some roads and the dump and fill stations. Definitely book here again. The RV sites are beautiful, the staff very friendly and efficient. I have never seen such fabulous fill aand dump stations.

  I found the ladies ""outhouse?"" by the centre beach deplorable. It was dirty and because I was desperate I used ... This is the most amazing provincial park. It's so beautiful. The beach is amazing for campers. The public use beach is ok but still pretty good. The playground for kids is really neat. Definitely worth the trip. Usually only go here for the group sites. Has many differnnt water fun things for rent like paddle boats and canoes. Waterfront nice, sites a good size. Bug free this mid Aug weekend. No water connection @sites. Nice big private campsites. Water taps are almost inside the campsite and is shared between 2 or 3 other campsites. I have camped at Emily Provincial Park a few times each year.  It has a nice beach for children to play and docks setup to allow campers and children to fish, which I haven't found at many provincial parks.  I have always camped on the ... Clean facilities and a nice beach. I really liked this campsite and the hiking trails (although they were short) Not a bad place, but not worth a long drive just for camping. Just an every day place. Good park, busy and small. Nice area and good for boats though. Bathrooms could be redone as they're showing their age. Had a terrific weekend, as part of a campaign. Heard from other folks at the park that it's better than other provincial  parks around the East end. Used to be a great park. Now wardens must have have something better to do at nights. Drinking and yelling all night with adults peeing all over their sites. Bad experience this time 😠 Not a bad camp site the staff try to keep everything clean, except the beach need some work. Emily Park isn't going to waste anymore of my time by writing a detailed review, but long story short.. We've been here a couple years ago and it was the best weekend we've had.

Is very accessible for ♿ Good place to go. Kids had a blast. Staff were great. Very accommodating  Visited on July 3rd. Not good for swimming. Water looks dirty. Fairly short drive from Toronto to the park. Park was full, but there was still some privacy. The water was not great for swimming.  Great kayak fishing in the area Weather was not on our side...torrential rain this past weekend so unable to fish or swim.  Cedars campground site was small and the bathroom closest to us was foul, you had hold your breath.  There should be some lighting in the ... Nice Campsite and close to the city Worked their and very nice, open, good employes, very beautiful quiet place to camp with the family or yourself 2 nice beaches aswell. Staff was friendly and efficient. The park itself is clean and quite large with a beach, docks for fishing and canoeing. Dont waste your good money on this park for a place that has been around since 1957 im not impressed that we still have outhouses no lighting. They also allow rvs to block roads dumping waste waited over a half hr to get back to my ... The park is not big and there isn't much to do there. There is a nice South beach, however - it wasn't crowded on the weekend and the water was okay for swimming (quite a bit of seaweed but warm). There were very little pesky mosquitoes, ... Great park. Helpful staff.  Quiet park. Nice beach.  Great family place to camp  Beautiful and good fishing Great vacation spot Because it's has lots of camping spots in every 4-parts of the park. Nice camping place  One of the nicest parks in the area Awesome place for camping Great Park - campsite had dog poop everywhere when we arrived but they came and cleaned it up promptly  Amazing and peacfull Nice family park Very fun.  Loved it and the beach was great Nice camp grounds,  not enough activities  Great park Pleasant staff, clean facilities and a nice location. We would camp here again. Park wardens are overbearing otherwise this would be a pretty good park.  The river looked a little low so we didn't launch the boat here.  The park lots and amenities were up to standard for a Provincial Park. Family comes here all the time, very private were we camp. Lots to choose from. Close to Toronto, nice sites  not a massive park but good nature.  Beautiful Trails  Great group sites Lots of fun and clean bathrooms very good for camping Dirty shallow water on the river.

I enjoyed going here even as a young kid, riding her bike through it. I spent many hours working out here and saw varying forms of wildlife such as foxes, raccoons, bear, and deer.

It's the kind of quiet ... Nice camping sites. Few trails to go on. Enjoyed the Ranney Falls trail, the falls, the suspension bridge  and the turtles. On the downside there is no lake within campground. Only swimming is in an indoor pool. Being a very warm weekend we had find natural water to dip in which was a half hours drive. This was our very first trip to the park. Parker was incredibly helpful at the main kiosk, great addition to the team! Beautiful views and trails to walk around different areas of the park. Of course the views from the Trellis bridge are the main draw, and they are worth the walk. I would recommend this spot to anyone! Simply beautiful.  Summer or winter. A fantastic place to visit. This is a very small park (160 sites.)  Most of it is designed for small tent trailers or tents and very little power (only 40.)  But it was fun.  Its a good place for fall/spring camping as a trek to Timmies is about 4km, and being cold you won't care that there isn't any swimming. It’s a park! Got in late when it got dark. So it was a bit of an effort to find my place (bicycling in). Sucks that it’s 40 bucks just to shower/sleep and leave the moment it’s light again. But hey. I like to support Park system. Terrible place to go camping. There is only one shower for all 163 campsites. Comfort stations are old and dirty.  We went camping in the Bedrock campground with the kids and met up with friends for the July long weekend. We were all ... We would camp here again. Lovely park. Roads are rough and the comfort station is what earned this 3 stars. For an entire campground there is only 1 shower on the male and female side for everyone. Needs to be updated badly. Trails were nice but needs to be marked better. Quiet, really close to a small town near by for quick shopping trips. Friendly and helpful staff, let us change our site reservation to a different site once we arrived and saw the sites.  We very much enjoyed our stay here and will be back.  We definitely recommend this park. Great provincial park for camping or a day trip! Several hiking trails of various difficulties, biking trails, and a cool suspension bridge looking out to some waterfalls and rapids. Fun place for the whole family! My honest opinion is...this place is overrated. Only hanging bridge and fall like rivers are the attraction. Not that much of color you will get in fall. Cute park, well maintained, if you need two sites together you can get privacy. Other sites are zero shade or privacy. Was able to find an inlet that was safe to swim, off one of the trails close to the boat launch A great park with a excellent ranger staff.  They were friendly & helpful, truly went out of their way to help visitors.  Nice choice of campgrounds & lots to do.  Very kid friendly place! Wonderful place to hike. Nice trails and beautiful views. This place is underrated. It has great hiking/biking trails, nice large campgrounds, scenic bridge, playground and is walking distance to town. We just returned from a 3 day weekend trip to Ferris. Overall, the park was lovely. The comfort stations are on the older side, but were generally quite clean (I have seen much worse). The park staff were very friendly as well. The only ... Great campsites! Wonderful hiking and biking! Close to town for supplies too! Love this place. Great trails, a mini swimming area and nice camping spots. Close to city yet you feel like you're out in the woods. Lovely place right in Campbellford. Trails are well maintained and very easy to do. Estimated times are very exaggerated; I casually walked the River Gorge Trail and it took me way less then an hour compared to the 2 hrs mentioned on the ... Not a bad park but trails are not marked well. Knowing where we were going would have made our visit more enjoyable. Recommend only for day trips and not for car camping. Not adequate comfort stations/showers. Always long lineup for showers during summer. No beach or a  place for any water activity. Was very nice camping ⛺️ two hours drive from Durham area family camping recommended Nice place with a few exceptions. One shower for the whole park and our site was littered with somebody's dirty underwear and trash. Spent the first 1/2 hour taking rib bones from my dog that he kept finding. However the trails are awesome and sites are private. We love it there for the peace and quiet. We have a travel trailer, so we do not use the amenities of the park much, but this time we had friends with us and we found out there are only two showers in the whole park. Also the roads are in terrible condition and maintenance is almost non existing. We had a great visit but the one BIG problem is that there is only one shower for women and one for men in the whole camp ground.  Lines ups all the time.  You guys really need to install a shower block like other Provincial Parks. Will not go back for this reason I liked this park, some privacy, people are nice, water is close by, roads are good, washrooms clean, and nice paths to walk around Not enough recycling bins! Found only one recycling centre with only two bins, and they were completely loaded. Nothing much to see except the suspension bridge. You can come from back side and save $11 on day pass to cross that bridge. The road inside the park is not paved and too much dust by cars Very nice and small park. We loved our short camping stop here. Reasonable campsite near the pretty town of campbleford... campsite was not the picture I was shown on the reservation...   pretty paid online and still no closer to sorting out park permit... Saud office was open to 11...  sign says ... Very clean park even though the road is gravel.
Very pleasant staff and helpful Nice waterfalls and riverside trail.  The suspension bridge is a great spot to take pictures of the river and falls.  Its really great in the spring when the water is running fast. So much fun! Go around 5 times maybe. Great for taking pictures. Great park, but the comfort station needs upgrades 1men and 1 ladies shower not enough. Met with daughter and her family camping they had great time will be back Its perfect for overnight camping trip and or day trips. Washrooms are clean and nice, and site is very safe Crossing the tention bridge. Great weekend adventure exploring the area. Not worth 12$ if you just come here for the bridge. Cant wait to come back Very awesome  park one of the best parks we have visited  clean well kept . Great roadside stop! Well maintained. Lots of photo ops The bridge is definitely the highlight It's a beautiful place, the hanging bridge is beautiful Easy access from town. The very safe suspension bridge is very good for those who are scared of heights but still want a quick thrill. In the spring and early summer the waterfall and rapids are an awesome sight. Great place to go for a casual walk. There is an easy flat path as well as safe steeper area for active kids. Staff was really nice. Camp grounds are nice and clean. Locals in town don't really like tourist. Only has one shower per gender for the whole park. Holds around 145 camp sites. So get in early or really late for a shower or prepare to ... Amazing location . some good some bad sites . just do your research Could be better. 

No showers. 

Bathrooms are too far. Amazing bridge and trails, nice place for a days hike and picnic Great park, was quiet and we had a fairly private site. Best to take a drive through to choose one as some are pretty open. There isn't really swimming but there are trails to walk/hike and a great view at the suspension bridge. Only ... Amazing park... lots to see and do in the area Decent park. Biggest drawback-there is only ONE shower for the entire campground. The physical space is wonderful but Ontario Parks have been left to decline. Facilities have been deteriorating and seasons shortened as prices rise.
Nonetheless, I enjoy the walking and cycling trails, the Ranney River Gorge and the ... We visited this park on a day trip for a very reasonable price of $11.25/vehicle. The trails are beautiful and have a combination of scenic fields, hilly forested areas, and a walk along the river. I was not impressed by the proximity to ... Loved it would of loved to spend longer. Place is good but washroom is in bad shape and only 1showe for total site Very nice camping location.  Lots of assorted sites with many variances.  Found the campers respectful of each other and quiet.  Close to town incase you forgot anything but still quiet.  The kids play area was lacking but nature helped make up for it. It has good hiking trails dont let Wynne rip you off.. go over to the town side and enter via power station bridge Good day trip but that’s it, it’s too small for much more than that The suspension bridge was a cool experience for me. I got a cheap kayak rental from the park office and got to check out the falls/ bridge from below which was nice. Definitely a place to check out. A park within the town a great get away to walk and smell nature and be beside water the whole time There isnt really anything to do and there is only 1 shower for the entire park. Good sized rv and camping sites. Water snakes observed near river, park advises they can bite if startled but are not poisonous. Also noticed poison ivy on trails but not on sites. Close to toen for resupply of provisions. Ferris Park is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon. You can walk in from Campbellford through a few different entrances, and you have your pick of multiple different trails. 

Even when it's filled with cars you won't run into more ... We only did a day visit for the hiking trails so cannot comment on camping facilities. Trails are not bad but could be better maintained. Perhaps widening of the trails to reduce risk of contact with ticks and poison ivy. Some of the ... This place is a great small campground. The trail is nice and marked with different tree species which is great if you love trees as I do. The suspension bridge is neat and the town is really close in case you forget something. Check out the cheese place and the chocolate factory in Campbellford. Beautiful quieter park. Great for families.  Playground on site. well maintained with clean facilities, friendly staff. Hydro avail. Lots of deer rabbits chipmunks etc. Great fishing with launch   kayak rentals.  Scenery is beautiful.  Check out the suspension bridge.  Note it is on  a river with current. no beach  One shower for the campground.   Pot holes galore.  No swimming allowed. Sloped and rocky site.   Fishing is best with a boat.  Not a park I'd recommend highly.  There are many better parks to camp. Very nice hiking trails and suspension bridge! Great place to go for a hike or walk! Trails are very flat and marked well! While we were only there for 2 nights the site was good both in size and privacy. Park has a couple nice sights as well as lots of trails to keep us busy. Only bad thing was fire wood we bought was wet The suspension bridge is awesome. You can see the river under your feet. The bridge will shake everytime people walk on it. The road from the office park to the parking lot is a gravel, not paved. They need to put more benches & tables for picnic. Need a tranquility? Away from city noice? Come and check md out! Nice enough park.  Comfort stations show signs of age...only one shower per gender per area (and no on site swimming spot).  Many spots grass/open.  Walking distance to town. Beautiful park, but quite pricey for a day pass. Skip the payment and walk-in over the suspension bridge instead. Awesome hiking trails Went Thanksgiving weekend; not many other campers there (fair number of RVers on electrical sites, but not many campers on non-electrical). Some nice walking trails - very scenic! Beautiful little park! Really disappointing that they dont have a beach however its completely understood why they don't. Little town of Campbellford nearby is a must see area. The suspension bridge on the parks grounds is not nearly as long as anticipated. A cute park to spend a night or two nonetheless.  The trails are easy to walk.  Recommended people to walk trail which is at the side of cliff (muddy @ rainy day).  It's safe because it's fences along the edge of cliffs.  
In the park, there's lookout that is near the falls.  
And ... Great hiking spot. Watch out for discarded  fishing hooks on the rocks. Small playground. The bridge over the river is a lot of fun. Clean spacious campsites. The hiking was great as well. Only downside is no swimming ! The suspension bridge was an experience i wont forget! This park is nothing more than large cleared areas in the bush. Most sites are muddy. There was evidence where vehicles had been stuck in the sites. The roads are very potholed and dusty. There are 150 site and only one shower for men ... Our camping spot was decent. About half of it was shaded which was good enough for us. The highlight for me though was going down into the river and jumping from the top of the water fall. Walking along the rocky shallow part of the ... Only one shower head for women in the entire park... The views from the Ramsey Gorge Suspension bridge are awesome. You can see a lot of turtles. The suspension bridge and walking trails are nice. Great place to visit and the price was excellent (free). Lots of walks, places to picnic, fishing from the bank and a boat launch area suitable for smaller craft. I love Ferris! The campsites are big..they're private and there's grass!! No dirt! The view from the top is breath taking! I have so many memories of this place! Great hiking trails with some that you really have to look for that are off the beaten trail. Amazing camp grounds and amazing wildlife! Nice spot to camp with family and a dog.  Friendly staff and good trails for a hike Love the trails and the bridge leads to the Locks which is a nice walk with the family to see and experience some free fun of seeing a boat traverse the system. Had a great time camping here. I was originally supposed to camp at Darlington Park but due to unforseen circumstances, I had to switch. 

This place is a nice quiet family friendly site to go with friends or family  

The Park Ranger s ... Beautiful park. Kayak rentals starting at $20 half days. Definitely going back. An awesome place just outside Campbellford eith lots of outdoor entertainment for the whole family including camping, hiking, picnics and fishing as well as lots of wildlife. This is a great weekend getaway camping spot. There are a wide range of camp sites and there are some cool spots to visit in Campbellford. Make sure to check out the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge which you can walk to from the campground. My family loved the thrill of walking in the  hanging bridge. The view is breathtaking! Beautiful place to walk around, bike or follow trails. Also see the giant two dollar coin. Quiet settings. But very dated facilities. Only one shower and only located at upper camp grounds.  A quiet little park with some great hiking trails and private campsites. Perfect for a weekend getaway. The service was great but there wasn't much to much to do in the park itself. Also I got 48 bites in 2 nights. More mosquitos than usual Suspension bridge is the highlight. It moves a bit, not for those who get dizzy Great views near the river. Trails are easy but markings sparse. Peaceful, quite, soothing place, perfect for meditation. The staff are way out there to help.quiet and clean.just about every site has privacy. If you dont mind the odd critter. Had a doe and 2 fawns lay down for a night 15 ft behind me.And of course racoons do what they do Good large, large campsites. However, only two shower heads for the entire campground  Suspension bridge is small but a great place to check out the rapids below. We thought we would really like this park because of it's proximity to Campbellford and the Trent Canal. However, we did not make the connection that a campsite at the very top of the hill (site #39) meant constant wind and pretty much ... Nice Camping site ,But has only one shower in the while area, It's a nice quiet park at night. The  lack of any real privacy at the camp sites does detract from it. All the hiking trails can be done in one day. The suspension bridge offers some nice photo opportunities.  Great trails and close to Campbellford which offer some great shopping. Love the bridge Awesome family camping :) so many bunnies in the park :) The waterfall was tiny.  We loved walking on the rock river bed and suspension bridge.  Besides that, there wasn't much to do.  I believe it's a great retreat spot for the locals, but we drove all the way from Toronto so it wasn't worth the trip. Quiet, scenic. A great spot to spend a Sunday.  A great park to be if you want some quiet time. Beautiful place Great facilities, it's an awesome glamping spot with the town close by. So beautiful The bridge is scary but beautiful views Great place andd the bridge was absolutely breathtaking Hiking trail fun! Exciting, wonderful,gorgeous views and lots to do and see! Great place to go Great park for picnics and camping. Nice park. great covered picnic area Good place for a winter hike Quiet clean lots to do. Great staff, short bike ride to splash pad and town.  Sites are a bit close but you can find some great ones that offer privacy. Large quiet park been twice and would go again Peaceful. Beautiful. One of my favourite places to go. Close to some awesome cheese, Empire Cheese...a fantastic bakery, Doohers, and great for a quick weekend away from home:) Great view from the suspension bridge. Bring a camera. Well kept and maintained campsites, though not the best privacy. Campground was great. Nice place for a walk Loved it excellent Great suspension bridge on West side of park. Lots of trails to have a walk through.  Great stop on a tour of Campbellford! Very unplanned provincial park. Only One narrow winding path to the campsites to reach. Only one shower for the entire park of camsites (approximately 170 or so). Very inconvenient  location. You have to drive through a winding single ... It's a beautiful hiking place  One of the nicest provincial parks out there. Very quiet.  Great place to camp with toddlers!  Grassy, quite sites, nice playground! Cozy nice place it is recommanded Going just to see the Ranney Gorge suspension bridge isn't worth it but that paired with a hike around the park itself is nice! Nice quiet park with a suspension bridge Lots of trails, scenic view of the river, Rainey suspension bridge. Very beautiful park Nice campground Great hiking trails and pleasant scenery with decent facilities  Nice walking park with camping Ok, quiet, no swimming. Nice jewel in a pretty town Fun place to camp a little pricey just to go in for a walk Beautiful and natural parkland Relaxing timr Amazing!!! Very nice campground Friendly staff, going over the suspension bridge is a must. Beautiful and picturesque place.  Absolutely beautiful!  Ferris park is in a great location. Great to bike Great park Great for walk nice trails Camped for a weekend worth it Nice and quiet. Nice place! Clean. Check out site 38 :) Beautiful Camping (Translated by Google) Nice place park was closed from the bridge nice to take photo.

Beautiful fall colours and vistasBeautiful, beautiful park.

I enjoyed going here even as a young kid, riding her bike through it. I spent many hours working out here and saw varying forms of wildlife such as foxes, raccoons, bear, and deer.

It's the kind of quiet ... Nice camping sites. Few trails to go on. Enjoyed the Ranney Falls trail, the falls, the suspension bridge  and the turtles. On the downside there is no lake within campground. Only swimming is in an indoor pool. Being a very warm weekend we had find natural water to dip in which was a half hours drive. This was our very first trip to the park. Parker was incredibly helpful at the main kiosk, great addition to the team! Beautiful views and trails to walk around different areas of the park. Of course the views from the Trellis bridge are the main draw, and they are worth the walk. I would recommend this spot to anyone! Simply beautiful.  Summer or winter. A fantastic place to visit. This is a very small park (160 sites.)  Most of it is designed for small tent trailers or tents and very little power (only 40.)  But it was fun.  Its a good place for fall/spring camping as a trek to Timmies is about 4km, and being cold you won't care that there isn't any swimming. It’s a park! Got in late when it got dark. So it was a bit of an effort to find my place (bicycling in). Sucks that it’s 40 bucks just to shower/sleep and leave the moment it’s light again. But hey. I like to support Park system. Terrible place to go camping. There is only one shower for all 163 campsites. Comfort stations are old and dirty.  We went camping in the Bedrock campground with the kids and met up with friends for the July long weekend. We were all ... We would camp here again. Lovely park. Roads are rough and the comfort station is what earned this 3 stars. For an entire campground there is only 1 shower on the male and female side for everyone. Needs to be updated badly. Trails were nice but needs to be marked better. Quiet, really close to a small town near by for quick shopping trips. Friendly and helpful staff, let us change our site reservation to a different site once we arrived and saw the sites.  We very much enjoyed our stay here and will be back.  We definitely recommend this park. Great provincial park for camping or a day trip! Several hiking trails of various difficulties, biking trails, and a cool suspension bridge looking out to some waterfalls and rapids. Fun place for the whole family! My honest opinion is...this place is overrated. Only hanging bridge and fall like rivers are the attraction. Not that much of color you will get in fall. Cute park, well maintained, if you need two sites together you can get privacy. Other sites are zero shade or privacy. Was able to find an inlet that was safe to swim, off one of the trails close to the boat launch A great park with a excellent ranger staff.  They were friendly & helpful, truly went out of their way to help visitors.  Nice choice of campgrounds & lots to do.  Very kid friendly place! Wonderful place to hike. Nice trails and beautiful views. This place is underrated. It has great hiking/biking trails, nice large campgrounds, scenic bridge, playground and is walking distance to town. We just returned from a 3 day weekend trip to Ferris. Overall, the park was lovely. The comfort stations are on the older side, but were generally quite clean (I have seen much worse). The park staff were very friendly as well. The only ... Great campsites! Wonderful hiking and biking! Close to town for supplies too! Love this place. Great trails, a mini swimming area and nice camping spots. Close to city yet you feel like you're out in the woods. Lovely place right in Campbellford. Trails are well maintained and very easy to do. Estimated times are very exaggerated; I casually walked the River Gorge Trail and it took me way less then an hour compared to the 2 hrs mentioned on the ... Not a bad park but trails are not marked well. Knowing where we were going would have made our visit more enjoyable. Recommend only for day trips and not for car camping. Not adequate comfort stations/showers. Always long lineup for showers during summer. No beach or a  place for any water activity. Was very nice camping ⛺️ two hours drive from Durham area family camping recommended Nice place with a few exceptions. One shower for the whole park and our site was littered with somebody's dirty underwear and trash. Spent the first 1/2 hour taking rib bones from my dog that he kept finding. However the trails are awesome and sites are private. We love it there for the peace and quiet. We have a travel trailer, so we do not use the amenities of the park much, but this time we had friends with us and we found out there are only two showers in the whole park. Also the roads are in terrible condition and maintenance is almost non existing. We had a great visit but the one BIG problem is that there is only one shower for women and one for men in the whole camp ground.  Lines ups all the time.  You guys really need to install a shower block like other Provincial Parks. Will not go back for this reason I liked this park, some privacy, people are nice, water is close by, roads are good, washrooms clean, and nice paths to walk around Not enough recycling bins! Found only one recycling centre with only two bins, and they were completely loaded. Nothing much to see except the suspension bridge. You can come from back side and save $11 on day pass to cross that bridge. The road inside the park is not paved and too much dust by cars Very nice and small park. We loved our short camping stop here. Reasonable campsite near the pretty town of campbleford... campsite was not the picture I was shown on the reservation...   pretty paid online and still no closer to sorting out park permit... Saud office was open to 11...  sign says ... Very clean park even though the road is gravel.
Very pleasant staff and helpful Nice waterfalls and riverside trail.  The suspension bridge is a great spot to take pictures of the river and falls.  Its really great in the spring when the water is running fast. So much fun! Go around 5 times maybe. Great for taking pictures. Great park, but the comfort station needs upgrades 1men and 1 ladies shower not enough. Met with daughter and her family camping they had great time will be back Its perfect for overnight camping trip and or day trips. Washrooms are clean and nice, and site is very safe Crossing the tention bridge. Great weekend adventure exploring the area. Not worth 12$ if you just come here for the bridge. Cant wait to come back Very awesome  park one of the best parks we have visited  clean well kept . Great roadside stop! Well maintained. Lots of photo ops The bridge is definitely the highlight It's a beautiful place, the hanging bridge is beautiful Easy access from town. The very safe suspension bridge is very good for those who are scared of heights but still want a quick thrill. In the spring and early summer the waterfall and rapids are an awesome sight. Great place to go for a casual walk. There is an easy flat path as well as safe steeper area for active kids. Staff was really nice. Camp grounds are nice and clean. Locals in town don't really like tourist. Only has one shower per gender for the whole park. Holds around 145 camp sites. So get in early or really late for a shower or prepare to ... Amazing location . some good some bad sites . just do your research Could be better. 

No showers. 

Bathrooms are too far. Amazing bridge and trails, nice place for a days hike and picnic Great park, was quiet and we had a fairly private site. Best to take a drive through to choose one as some are pretty open. There isn't really swimming but there are trails to walk/hike and a great view at the suspension bridge. Only ... Amazing park... lots to see and do in the area Decent park. Biggest drawback-there is only ONE shower for the entire campground. The physical space is wonderful but Ontario Parks have been left to decline. Facilities have been deteriorating and seasons shortened as prices rise.
Nonetheless, I enjoy the walking and cycling trails, the Ranney River Gorge and the ... We visited this park on a day trip for a very reasonable price of $11.25/vehicle. The trails are beautiful and have a combination of scenic fields, hilly forested areas, and a walk along the river. I was not impressed by the proximity to ... Loved it would of loved to spend longer. Place is good but washroom is in bad shape and only 1showe for total site Very nice camping location.  Lots of assorted sites with many variances.  Found the campers respectful of each other and quiet.  Close to town incase you forgot anything but still quiet.  The kids play area was lacking but nature helped make up for it. It has good hiking trails dont let Wynne rip you off.. go over to the town side and enter via power station bridge Good day trip but that’s it, it’s too small for much more than that The suspension bridge was a cool experience for me. I got a cheap kayak rental from the park office and got to check out the falls/ bridge from below which was nice. Definitely a place to check out. A park within the town a great get away to walk and smell nature and be beside water the whole time There isnt really anything to do and there is only 1 shower for the entire park. Good sized rv and camping sites. Water snakes observed near river, park advises they can bite if startled but are not poisonous. Also noticed poison ivy on trails but not on sites. Close to toen for resupply of provisions. Ferris Park is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon. You can walk in from Campbellford through a few different entrances, and you have your pick of multiple different trails. 

Even when it's filled with cars you won't run into more ... We only did a day visit for the hiking trails so cannot comment on camping facilities. Trails are not bad but could be better maintained. Perhaps widening of the trails to reduce risk of contact with ticks and poison ivy. Some of the ... This place is a great small campground. The trail is nice and marked with different tree species which is great if you love trees as I do. The suspension bridge is neat and the town is really close in case you forget something. Check out the cheese place and the chocolate factory in Campbellford. Beautiful quieter park. Great for families.  Playground on site. well maintained with clean facilities, friendly staff. Hydro avail. Lots of deer rabbits chipmunks etc. Great fishing with launch   kayak rentals.  Scenery is beautiful.  Check out the suspension bridge.  Note it is on  a river with current. no beach  One shower for the campground.   Pot holes galore.  No swimming allowed. Sloped and rocky site.   Fishing is best with a boat.  Not a park I'd recommend highly.  There are many better parks to camp. Very nice hiking trails and suspension bridge! Great place to go for a hike or walk! Trails are very flat and marked well! While we were only there for 2 nights the site was good both in size and privacy. Park has a couple nice sights as well as lots of trails to keep us busy. Only bad thing was fire wood we bought was wet The suspension bridge is awesome. You can see the river under your feet. The bridge will shake everytime people walk on it. The road from the office park to the parking lot is a gravel, not paved. They need to put more benches & tables for picnic. Need a tranquility? Away from city noice? Come and check md out! Nice enough park.  Comfort stations show signs of age...only one shower per gender per area (and no on site swimming spot).  Many spots grass/open.  Walking distance to town. Beautiful park, but quite pricey for a day pass. Skip the payment and walk-in over the suspension bridge instead. Awesome hiking trails Went Thanksgiving weekend; not many other campers there (fair number of RVers on electrical sites, but not many campers on non-electrical). Some nice walking trails - very scenic! Beautiful little park! Really disappointing that they dont have a beach however its completely understood why they don't. Little town of Campbellford nearby is a must see area. The suspension bridge on the parks grounds is not nearly as long as anticipated. A cute park to spend a night or two nonetheless.  The trails are easy to walk.  Recommended people to walk trail which is at the side of cliff (muddy @ rainy day).  It's safe because it's fences along the edge of cliffs.  
In the park, there's lookout that is near the falls.  
And ... Great hiking spot. Watch out for discarded  fishing hooks on the rocks. Small playground. The bridge over the river is a lot of fun. Clean spacious campsites. The hiking was great as well. Only downside is no swimming ! The suspension bridge was an experience i wont forget! This park is nothing more than large cleared areas in the bush. Most sites are muddy. There was evidence where vehicles had been stuck in the sites. The roads are very potholed and dusty. There are 150 site and only one shower for men ... Our camping spot was decent. About half of it was shaded which was good enough for us. The highlight for me though was going down into the river and jumping from the top of the water fall. Walking along the rocky shallow part of the ... Only one shower head for women in the entire park... The views from the Ramsey Gorge Suspension bridge are awesome. You can see a lot of turtles. The suspension bridge and walking trails are nice. Great place to visit and the price was excellent (free). Lots of walks, places to picnic, fishing from the bank and a boat launch area suitable for smaller craft. I love Ferris! The campsites are big..they're private and there's grass!! No dirt! The view from the top is breath taking! I have so many memories of this place! Great hiking trails with some that you really have to look for that are off the beaten trail. Amazing camp grounds and amazing wildlife! Nice spot to camp with family and a dog.  Friendly staff and good trails for a hike Love the trails and the bridge leads to the Locks which is a nice walk with the family to see and experience some free fun of seeing a boat traverse the system. Had a great time camping here. I was originally supposed to camp at Darlington Park but due to unforseen circumstances, I had to switch. 

This place is a nice quiet family friendly site to go with friends or family  

The Park Ranger s ... Beautiful park. Kayak rentals starting at $20 half days. Definitely going back. An awesome place just outside Campbellford eith lots of outdoor entertainment for the whole family including camping, hiking, picnics and fishing as well as lots of wildlife. This is a great weekend getaway camping spot. There are a wide range of camp sites and there are some cool spots to visit in Campbellford. Make sure to check out the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge which you can walk to from the campground. My family loved the thrill of walking in the  hanging bridge. The view is breathtaking! Beautiful place to walk around, bike or follow trails. Also see the giant two dollar coin. Quiet settings. But very dated facilities. Only one shower and only located at upper camp grounds.  A quiet little park with some great hiking trails and private campsites. Perfect for a weekend getaway. The service was great but there wasn't much to much to do in the park itself. Also I got 48 bites in 2 nights. More mosquitos than usual Suspension bridge is the highlight. It moves a bit, not for those who get dizzy Great views near the river. Trails are easy but markings sparse. Peaceful, quite, soothing place, perfect for meditation. The staff are way out there to help.quiet and clean.just about every site has privacy. If you dont mind the odd critter. Had a doe and 2 fawns lay down for a night 15 ft behind me.And of course racoons do what they do Good large, large campsites. However, only two shower heads for the entire campground  Suspension bridge is small but a great place to check out the rapids below. We thought we would really like this park because of it's proximity to Campbellford and the Trent Canal. However, we did not make the connection that a campsite at the very top of the hill (site #39) meant constant wind and pretty much ... Nice Camping site ,But has only one shower in the while area, It's a nice quiet park at night. The  lack of any real privacy at the camp sites does detract from it. All the hiking trails can be done in one day. The suspension bridge offers some nice photo opportunities.  Great trails and close to Campbellford which offer some great shopping. Love the bridge Awesome family camping :) so many bunnies in the park :) The waterfall was tiny.  We loved walking on the rock river bed and suspension bridge.  Besides that, there wasn't much to do.  I believe it's a great retreat spot for the locals, but we drove all the way from Toronto so it wasn't worth the trip. Quiet, scenic. A great spot to spend a Sunday.  A great park to be if you want some quiet time. Beautiful place Great facilities, it's an awesome glamping spot with the town close by. So beautiful The bridge is scary but beautiful views Great place andd the bridge was absolutely breathtaking Hiking trail fun! Exciting, wonderful,gorgeous views and lots to do and see! Great place to go Great park for picnics and camping. Nice park. great covered picnic area Good place for a winter hike Quiet clean lots to do. Great staff, short bike ride to splash pad and town.

It can be a challenge to find your site, but this park has all the trimmings, and some really great sites for families. Modern amenities and good fishing...will visit again for sure! Nice campground, the first one we went and it had no running water on spot nor electricity. We still enjoyed it very much. The site is clean and it is beautiful. The only downside is the poison ivy in many spots. Staff are polite but inexperienced and slow.

And the fact that it's far from city lights makes it an easy candidate for casual star gazing (not a light ... Great park that has a lot of different areas to explore and take great photos. The waterfall area at the end was a little hard to get any photos of but still a great little hike. A deer actually jumped right in front of us while we we're ... A great place to ride. Never I did missed going here during the riding season. Refreshing atmosphere after a long ride.

It's either grab an ice cream, a cup of coffee/beverages or just a quick stop and again hit on the road. An amazing park. We went on a 3 hour hike up to the waterfall with my 7 month old in a sling and 2 year old walking/ riding on daddy's back. It was quite the hike, but we got some amazing family pictures. Do not take a stroller or bike if you plan to go up to the falls! It's so beautiful here! I definitely recommend hiking all the way down to the waterfalls. Great little park. Easy walking and very scenic. There were toilets at the carpark as well as further into the park. Easily conquerable in half a day. Probably about 10km worth of trails all up. Beautiful fall colors and the cataract falls were very pretty. The waterfall was nice but the trail getting you closer was closed. The trail after where they disallow mountains bike is pretty steep but worth the walk. Parking was $7.50 for 4 hours. The leaves were beautiful with the fall colours ! Do visit this park! The drive alone is worth it. There are so many paths and trails to take. Some are more challenging than others. You can have a nice time here with family as well. Bring a picnic lunch and relax near the river. There ... This is a beautiful spot with several trails for various levels of ability. If you want to get to the falls, it's a bit challenging and long. It can take an hour there and an hour back. Don't bring strollers! These trails are not ... They should update the signage for the falls so people realize how far it is from the parking lot. At least two different groups stopped us to ask. The falls viewing platform was under construction and closed. 

The meadow trail was beautiful though. Highly recommend it for a walk amongst the flowers and insects. Awesome fall day at the trails. You can cover all routes in a day. Beautiful scenery in fall with leaves colors. Good for hike bike. We spent almost four hours with kids and went through 8 kilometers of hiking. Great way to spend an afternoon. It took us an hour and a half to walk to the falls and then back to the lot. There are lots of hills so dress comfortably.

The falls at the end was very anticlimactic. Scenic park with nice variety of hiking trails, though the stepped hill is a killer to climb back up! Most scenic area near the falls has been closed for a while. Would be nice to see it reopened! A beautiful park just to relax, walk or hike. There isn't a lot of activities to do here. So don't bring big groups of friends in hope of entertaining them. This place is suitable for nature lovers who just want to avoid the city and enjoy nature as it is. Winding trails galore with each one having its own stunning view. Perfect for people who like to veer off the beaten path as some of the best views are just out of sight of the path. Well kept trails, plenty of maps, clearly marked paths; not much more you could ask for. A beautiful trail to walk through, especially in the fall. Some trails are challenging with up and down hills. The falls are underwhelming at best. Nonetheless, the hike to the falls and back is beautiful. Awesome spot to go hiking, cool waterfall at the end too. Definitely worth checking it out. Total distance there and back is about 5km but with the terrain expect to be going for 1.5 - 2 hours if you do the entire loop. If you're going for a view of the falls, then don't bother going. It's a 45 minute walk their and back (up a very steep hill on way back) and you can't really see the falls because they've closed the viewing platform, and trees obscure ... WOW! The view of the falls & trails were really great. The hike was a mix of intense uphill & then a few flat areas. Such a great place to take a nice solo or family hike. What an amazing place to visit rolling hills and trees and a river and streams,it's all there to enjoy and I took my bike there in the winter and had a blast just a few weeks ago.So much fun here and spectacular views as well as the trans Canada trail runs through it I highly recommend coming here. Beautiful spot for a 11 km hike. Leaves are beautiful at this time on Thanksgiving day. River flowing, small falls etc. Great place to take the dogs for a hike. Trails of different length for novice to extreme hikers. Mixture of shade and sun throughout the walk if your animal doesn't like the heat. Bring lots of water, especially if you plan on walking to the falls. Oh, and have fun! :) Amazing park, feels so good to walk in! Not many people either. My favorite experience of the summer. 

Tons of frogs on the trails so keep an eye out Perfect place to visit especially if you are a biker! A nice park to hike through with relatively easy trails surrounded by fields that are decorated with wild flowers and trees.  Access to the falls is limited due to the area being sealed off so only a view partially blocked by foliage is ... Three trail entrances here. Looks like we took the most boring (mostly flatlands) route. Will definitely go back and try the others What a great place to hike. I have hiked it in the summer and winter, both were so enjoyable. I wish they would fix the walk way to the overlook of the old dam, but the rest provides a variety of trails and sites! A nice trail, good for a afternoon hike. Not so good for mountain biking due to very uneven terrain with narrow paths and lots of steep inclines not suitable for riding. Only about 40% is good for riding, the rest is better off being ... I liked that the paid parking was flexible instead of flat rate.
Nice area, bummed that the trail to the waterfall is closed off though. A nice place to go for a hike. A lot of the waterfall view was closed off for safety.  We came because the Ontario parks leaf report was claiming close to 80% color, but most leaves were gone by then. Parking was crazy. Nice place to hike. Currently the viewing deck is closed causing alot of trouble for hiking. Its roughly $7 to park for 4 hours and hike. The scenery during fall is like no other. Water fall is currently hard to see with the viewing deck being blocked. We went to see fall colours, but didn't find any colours at all, infact very few trees in the park. There were more trees and colour in park near my home. The best time to visit is in the Fall! 
The colours are amazing!!
Don't forget to stop by the Belfountain Conservation Area ( show up early to avoid the dreaded "" parking lot full "" sign.) One of my favourite Provincial parks around Toronto. It is small but has very different landscapes - woods, lake, grassy fields and even a waterfall (albeit ugly). It was great for spending an autumn day in the nature and shooting some good photos of trees with different colors. Very refreshing walk. Good trails and plenty of scenic beauty to click. The hike to the waterfall did not seem to take too long. Perhaps it was the company that I had. There are many ups and downs so don't get too comfortable with one or the other. There's also a mix between being in the sun and in the ... Awesome place... always warm and cozy...even in cold winter. It is a beautiful place to hike. Beautiful scenery and greenery. I hiked to the falls, not the easiest hike, a little challenging but worth it to see the falls. If you are an avid hiker definitely recommend this experience. For anyone ... A good walk.  Great hike.  Moderate to steep terrain.  Not ideal for strollers.  The only disappointing point is. The trail end just before the falls. Looks like the trail was eroded off the side of the embankment.  A fence now blocks ... This provincial park has multiple trails, some of which are easy enough for young kids as well. Most of the trails are not stroller accessible. Lookout for waterfall is closed for now. Been there twice for Star Grazing, pitch black just what you need for Astro Photography, plus its not far from the city. Lately its my fav spot for star grazing. Great place for mountain biking and hiking. This place was awesome lots of beautiful scenery and moderate to difficult trails by foot or mountain bike Steep trail leading to ""waterfall"". I've seen people turn back because they see what's ahead. And it's a 2+ hour hike to it so make sure you bring water and maybe a towel to wipe sweat. 

I Loved it and will be returning because of that ... Great hiking here although you have to make sure to bring sunscreen. There's no shade here when you are walking. The observation deck is also out of commission so while you can still see the falls there's two hills that you have to go down and up and down and up to get back. Not for the elderly or people with leg problems Such a great place to visit for a quick hike and really nice scenes to see. Great little ice cream shop to stop at once you leave the park or before if you can't wait. Great trails and scenic.  Not overcrowded. Bring food, water and hand sanitizer.  Consider long pants for field trail in case of ticks.  Definately bring hiking boots a hat and sunscreen. Great park for hiking all year. Dogs need to be on a leash sadly and it gets busy in the summer.  The lake is gorgeous and easy to get to, while the falls are a much longer hike but worth it. Parking is paid and enforced in summer. Beautiful trek to see the fall colors. The trail is not flat so wear good footwear. Wonderful trails. Quite a few hills so wear comfortable shoes Beautiful landscape. Nice people, great ice cream in Belfountain! Great place to take the family for a day hike Beautiful trail with different habitats and biogeography. 100% would visit again A calm and relaxing place to hike. The viewing deck for the falls was under construction when we visited last Sep2018 so the long hike was a little disappointing but we still manage to get a glimpse of the falls. One of the nicest hikes anyone can take close to Toronto... Love this place... been coming here for years and now I'm passing on the legacy to my son Noah so he can appretiate it too...! Nice park.  Nice trails.  View of falls is blocked as trail is blocked.  Parking IS NOT FREE.. USE TO BE FREE .. that was annoying.  
There are bathrooms at parkimg area only. Great hike, especially for autumn when the leaves change colour Awesome trail for walking and hiking One of the first places I hiked in and still one of my favorites. Sadly, I remember the days when the parking was free! LOL Other than that, it has a great mixture of flat and slightly more rugged trails that meander around a beautiful ... A nice scenic hike with somewhat easy trails.  Would recommend for the family Good trails, but in summers you can't really see the falls from where the trail ends so don't visit just for the falls Beautiful hikes and lovely waterfalls ...the hikes ranged from easy to difficult with natural inclines and walkways. The hike itself was free from jagged rocks and broken branches so it made for an enjoyable hike in beautiful Caledon. Would probably be better if we didn't go when all the trees were brown and bare. The hike up to the waterfalls unfortunately was not worth it, on the bright side our little dog enjoyed the mini lake closer to the parking lot. Great park for a short hike, and good access to the Bruce trail! The grassy, rolling hills along the meadow trail are neat. This is probably one of the best driving roads close to toronto, if not the best. There's a lot to do if you come during the day when the weather's nice. A couple of nice parks around and this one is no exception. Drive the forks as many times as you can, the hairpin is my favorite part 😉 Best getaway for a peaceful hike.
Not crowded and totally worth the walk. Good park to hike. The drive there is pretty fun if you like to rip it on backroads Nice place to be in touch with nature, but very busy on weekends It was amazing to see the nature in Fall. A really nice trail that ends with a nice waterfall. The view isn't amazing but still a nice trail Nice place to go for a scenic view Great hike! For those who need a more accessible hike keep  in mind towards the falls it walking can get pretty steep uphill and downhill. Nature at its best and well maintained park Loads of potholes at park entrance making it a bit challenging to drive into but once your in its a very nice park. Would recommend the trip as I had a lovely time. Many trials hiked. 

Bathrooms provided and pay parking Good for a day hike. The trail starts a bit flat but parts further away closer to the credit river are much nicer. It's an alright hike.  The path around the falls seems to be closed every winter which sucks. Amazing! Trails are well maintained and varied. Some sections quite steep. Connection to Bruce trail on the north section is closed at the moment Great park to go hiking for an hour, two or the day. Lots of trails to choose from, huge network of trails that are well signed making it easy to find your way and these trails connect to the Trans Canada Trail and the Bruce Trail. Easy ... Good for fall colours in early october I like to go hiking in this park particularly from the West end where it is more interesting. The waterfalls at the north end is now inaccessible due to the instability of the area. To see some of the waterfall you have to approach the area from the lower portion. Be careful. Beautiful place but to go to the falls there is no instruction about how far it is so it was really hard to walk all the way with my baby and my mom....
The park could put instructions saying you are that miles close to the fall... Great trail. Had lots of fun and you can take small children as well as it is not difficult  as all. I just wish people would not throw garbage there as that just ruins the area. Nice quiet park. Few facilities but great trails. Amazing hiking experience.. Very tough but the scenery is incredible.. A must see Went there for fossil hunting, nice and quiet place, 2 hrs to walk to the small fall, trail is also end there, we can’t walk close to the fall. Loved the walk in the park. Beautiful falls. Another great day away from the city. Such a great place to go hiking with friends. Lots of trails to pick from and good for beginners to. Only a small pet peeve is some of the trails end abruptly because it reaches a privately owned land and is fenced off. But I highly recommend this location. Beautiful area and hikes can last 4-6 hours. It's quite a long way to cataract falls. But it's worth the hike. I would rate the trail to the falls a 6/10 in difficulty. My friend and I had some moments where we were out of breath for sure. Very good place to go with family, watch out for police using radar.
Beautiful drive in any season, unbelievably beautiful in the fall. Nothing special. Not worth the visit Took about an hour to get to the falls for a not so great view of them. Lovely place and great for cardio due to the hills but the view would be better if you could get closer. Every summer I ride my motorcycle on the Forks over 15 times because if the beautiful roads and spectacular scenery.
There are only a handful of roads I go to, and I am happy to say that this is one of the top 3 that i would reccomend to ... Fun place to hike. Tons of wildlife!

Nice park, signage is terrible.  Need to fix the path I think its an ex-mind area. Not much of a view but nice place to have a walk Its very good. Great beautiful park.

Well laid out trails and possibilities to get very close to the falls. The roads surrounding the park itself is also very great. Beautiful winding roads to enjoy to and from the park.

Just check the weather and make sure that the snow's melted completely if you plan on using running shoes... Excellent place for a day getaway A beautiful little town and calm nature reserve:) Well... it’s hilly, which is very rare in Ontario. The course is short (about 7km) but somewhat fun. Parking was around 5.25 for 2 hours and about 7 dollars for four hours. I don't recall how much the full day was as I only did two hours. If you are planning to hike to the falls, I would suggest choosing four hours as it takes about an ... Beautiful and peaceful place.. Awesome to spend some quality time. I feel like I'm in a hilly area. Absolutely love this place. Peaceful and beautiful! Nice trails and clean picnic area.... This park is a nice place to spend 2 to 3 hours hiking.

To see the falls, be prepared to uphill and downhill for 60 minutes. Bring hiking poles would be wise. However, the view of the falls is not very good as the best spots are blocked ... Big park with a few different trails. The fall isn't anything special but it's a good motivator for a hike! Beautiful park with long trails that connect to the Bruce trail and the Trans Canada trail.  In the spring you can catch the lilacs blooming and have a picnic. Beautiful & Tranquil Place . Nice place to trek Good hiking route One less star for inadequate parking. The park itself is decent, the nature there isn't very striking. Gave 4 stars to the drive on the road (i.e. Mississauga rd) which runs alongside the park - it was a really windy and fun drive!

Will I visit the park again? Probably. (since, to be fair, I haven't properly explored the place) This place is nice specially in Spring and fall. I usually go there often. The drive is nice. Not enough parking spaces though!! This was a fun hike today. It took me about 35 minutes to get to the falls. The trail that normally is taken to the falls is closed because the structure is unsafe, so the park has signs like the one in the photo that show how to get to ... Very cool clean peaceful natural environment If you can take up a challenge, looking forward to reach the waterfalls from your car-park...its not for the weak hearted.

At the end of the trial is a very nice fall. The do block it off so you can't go further to see. Easy hike for all types of people.  The park is absolutely gorgeous.  I recommend checking it out in the fall the colors are stunning.  Lots of different side trails to explore and it connects with the Bruce Trail and the Trans Canada Trail.  The trails here are pretty ... Parking: $5.50(2hrs), $7.50(4hrs)
Free of entrance. Easy hiking of flat path, the fall is very tiny (0.5m?)
Great place for hiking, close to Toronto. I love this place. Been up and down several times over the years. Quarrymans trail is lovely. The 14 dollar parking fee isn't really enforced. I've never seen anyone getting a ticket. Honestly I wish it was as it would deter the abusers ... Beautiful park...

Beautiful. Gorgeous. Family fun. It's a great place for a hike and great views! It has various hiking paths and you can decide to shorten or lengthen your hike. The trails are marked so easy for everyone to use. There are various features including lakes, beautiful bridges and falls. One tjis you want to be careful of is Poison Ivy. There are lots of them in the park Great walking area. Just don't forget the mosquito repellent! Some trails are blocked at the moment so you might have to go back instead of making a loop. There is a parking lot for the parking fees that works with credit card (around 5$ for 2h). Poorly maintained facilities. Smelly washrooms without water. All provincial parks should be taken better care of. I wish government sould spend more money on parks and children's playground. I just feel disappointed because we pay so much tax then get so little. U.S. did 5 times better job on these kind of facilities.
.. Summer days are awesome here. The park abounds with insects and insect eating birds. I love the chorus of little voices coming from the surrounding trees and tall grasses.  The park is big but it's easy to find your way around thanks to the clear and we'll located signs. Easy hikes on a relatively even ground. A few hills and stairs but for the Niagara Escarpment this is one of the easier hikes. One of my favorite hiking spots in the city Took my kids here today.
There was a lot more to explore but we took the short path and returned because were getting tired.
Beautiful and peaceful place to visit. So beautiful Good landscape for hikers Beautiful and well kept trails. Love bringing my dog here all year long.

We have been going more and more and it's so nice to be able to explore a new path every time! Water fall is definitely a difficult hike but lots of nice stuff to see.

Though beautiful, the grounds are littered in garbage throughout, and the parking is on par with the more expensive downtown lots. A great place to hike with lots of photographic opportunities.

靠近瀑布的红叶不错！","Forks of the Credit is on the famous Bruce Trail.
Hiking and picnicking are favourite activities.
Great spot for fishing.
Popular in the winter for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.Very scenic and tranquil place for hiking and biking, the trails are long enough and diverse enough for different adventures. 
And the fact that it's far from city lights makes it an easy candidate for casual star gazing (not a light ... Great park that has a lot of different areas to explore and take great photos. The waterfall area at the end was a little hard to get any photos of but still a great little hike. A deer actually jumped right in front of us while we we're ... A great place to ride. Never I did missed going here during the riding season. Refreshing atmosphere after a long ride.

It's either grab an ice cream, a cup of coffee/beverages or just a quick stop and again hit on the road. An amazing park. We went on a 3 hour hike up to the waterfall with my 7 month old in a sling and 2 year old walking/ riding on daddy's back. It was quite the hike, but we got some amazing family pictures. Do not take a stroller or bike if you plan to go up to the falls! It's so beautiful here! I definitely recommend hiking all the way down to the waterfalls. Great little park. Easy walking and very scenic. There were toilets at the carpark as well as further into the park. Easily conquerable in half a day. Probably about 10km worth of trails all up. Beautiful fall colors and the cataract falls were very pretty. The waterfall was nice but the trail getting you closer was closed. The trail after where they disallow mountains bike is pretty steep but worth the walk. Parking was $7.50 for 4 hours. The leaves were beautiful with the fall colours ! Do visit this park! The drive alone is worth it. There are so many paths and trails to take. Some are more challenging than others. You can have a nice time here with family as well. Bring a picnic lunch and relax near the river. There ... This is a beautiful spot with several trails for various levels of ability. If you want to get to the falls, it's a bit challenging and long. It can take an hour there and an hour back. Don't bring strollers! These trails are not ... They should update the signage for the falls so people realize how far it is from the parking lot. At least two different groups stopped us to ask. The falls viewing platform was under construction and closed. 

The meadow trail was beautiful though. Highly recommend it for a walk amongst the flowers and insects. Awesome fall day at the trails. You can cover all routes in a day. Beautiful scenery in fall with leaves colors. Good for hike bike. We spent almost four hours with kids and went through 8 kilometers of hiking. Great way to spend an afternoon. It took us an hour and a half to walk to the falls and then back to the lot. There are lots of hills so dress comfortably.

The falls at the end was very anticlimactic. Scenic park with nice variety of hiking trails, though the stepped hill is a killer to climb back up! Most scenic area near the falls has been closed for a while. Would be nice to see it reopened! A beautiful park just to relax, walk or hike. There isn't a lot of activities to do here. So don't bring big groups of friends in hope of entertaining them. This place is suitable for nature lovers who just want to avoid the city and enjoy nature as it is. Winding trails galore with each one having its own stunning view. Perfect for people who like to veer off the beaten path as some of the best views are just out of sight of the path. Well kept trails, plenty of maps, clearly marked paths; not much more you could ask for. A beautiful trail to walk through, especially in the fall. Some trails are challenging with up and down hills. The falls are underwhelming at best. Nonetheless, the hike to the falls and back is beautiful. Awesome spot to go hiking, cool waterfall at the end too. Definitely worth checking it out. Total distance there and back is about 5km but with the terrain expect to be going for 1.5 - 2 hours if you do the entire loop. If you're going for a view of the falls, then don't bother going. It's a 45 minute walk their and back (up a very steep hill on way back) and you can't really see the falls because they've closed the viewing platform, and trees obscure ... WOW! The view of the falls & trails were really great. The hike was a mix of intense uphill & then a few flat areas. Such a great place to take a nice solo or family hike. What an amazing place to visit rolling hills and trees and a river and streams,it's all there to enjoy and I took my bike there in the winter and had a blast just a few weeks ago.So much fun here and spectacular views as well as the trans Canada trail runs through it I highly recommend coming here. Beautiful spot for a 11 km hike. Leaves are beautiful at this time on Thanksgiving day. River flowing, small falls etc. Great place to take the dogs for a hike. Trails of different length for novice to extreme hikers. Mixture of shade and sun throughout the walk if your animal doesn't like the heat. Bring lots of water, especially if you plan on walking to the falls. Oh, and have fun! :) Amazing park, feels so good to walk in! Not many people either. My favorite experience of the summer. 

Tons of frogs on the trails so keep an eye out Perfect place to visit especially if you are a biker! A nice park to hike through with relatively easy trails surrounded by fields that are decorated with wild flowers and trees.  Access to the falls is limited due to the area being sealed off so only a view partially blocked by foliage is ... Three trail entrances here. Looks like we took the most boring (mostly flatlands) route. Will definitely go back and try the others What a great place to hike. I have hiked it in the summer and winter, both were so enjoyable. I wish they would fix the walk way to the overlook of the old dam, but the rest provides a variety of trails and sites! A nice trail, good for a afternoon hike. Not so good for mountain biking due to very uneven terrain with narrow paths and lots of steep inclines not suitable for riding. Only about 40% is good for riding, the rest is better off being ... I liked that the paid parking was flexible instead of flat rate.
Nice area, bummed that the trail to the waterfall is closed off though. A nice place to go for a hike. A lot of the waterfall view was closed off for safety.  We came because the Ontario parks leaf report was claiming close to 80% color, but most leaves were gone by then. Parking was crazy. Nice place to hike. Currently the viewing deck is closed causing alot of trouble for hiking. Its roughly $7 to park for 4 hours and hike. The scenery during fall is like no other. Water fall is currently hard to see with the viewing deck being blocked. We went to see fall colours, but didn't find any colours at all, infact very few trees in the park. There were more trees and colour in park near my home. The best time to visit is in the Fall! 
The colours are amazing!!
Don't forget to stop by the Belfountain Conservation Area ( show up early to avoid the dreaded "" parking lot full "" sign.) One of my favourite Provincial parks around Toronto. It is small but has very different landscapes - woods, lake, grassy fields and even a waterfall (albeit ugly). It was great for spending an autumn day in the nature and shooting some good photos of trees with different colors. Very refreshing walk. Good trails and plenty of scenic beauty to click. The hike to the waterfall did not seem to take too long. Perhaps it was the company that I had. There are many ups and downs so don't get too comfortable with one or the other. There's also a mix between being in the sun and in the ... Awesome place... always warm and cozy...even in cold winter. It is a beautiful place to hike. Beautiful scenery and greenery. I hiked to the falls, not the easiest hike, a little challenging but worth it to see the falls. If you are an avid hiker definitely recommend this experience. For anyone ... A good walk.  Great hike.  Moderate to steep terrain.  Not ideal for strollers.  The only disappointing point is. The trail end just before the falls. Looks like the trail was eroded off the side of the embankment.  A fence now blocks ... This provincial park has multiple trails, some of which are easy enough for young kids as well. Most of the trails are not stroller accessible. Lookout for waterfall is closed for now. Been there twice for Star Grazing, pitch black just what you need for Astro Photography, plus its not far from the city. Lately its my fav spot for star grazing. Great place for mountain biking and hiking. This place was awesome lots of beautiful scenery and moderate to difficult trails by foot or mountain bike Steep trail leading to ""waterfall"". I've seen people turn back because they see what's ahead. And it's a 2+ hour hike to it so make sure you bring water and maybe a towel to wipe sweat. 

I Loved it and will be returning because of that ... Great hiking here although you have to make sure to bring sunscreen. There's no shade here when you are walking. The observation deck is also out of commission so while you can still see the falls there's two hills that you have to go down and up and down and up to get back. Not for the elderly or people with leg problems Such a great place to visit for a quick hike and really nice scenes to see. Great little ice cream shop to stop at once you leave the park or before if you can't wait. Great trails and scenic.  Not overcrowded. Bring food, water and hand sanitizer.  Consider long pants for field trail in case of ticks.  Definately bring hiking boots a hat and sunscreen. Great park for hiking all year. Dogs need to be on a leash sadly and it gets busy in the summer.  The lake is gorgeous and easy to get to, while the falls are a much longer hike but worth it. Parking is paid and enforced in summer. Beautiful trek to see the fall colors. The trail is not flat so wear good footwear. Wonderful trails. Quite a few hills so wear comfortable shoes Beautiful landscape. Nice people, great ice cream in Belfountain! Great place to take the family for a day hike Beautiful trail with different habitats and biogeography. 100% would visit again A calm and relaxing place to hike. The viewing deck for the falls was under construction when we visited last Sep2018 so the long hike was a little disappointing but we still manage to get a glimpse of the falls. One of the nicest hikes anyone can take close to Toronto... Love this place... been coming here for years and now I'm passing on the legacy to my son Noah so he can appretiate it too...! Nice park.  Nice trails.  View of falls is blocked as trail is blocked.  Parking IS NOT FREE.. USE TO BE FREE .. that was annoying.  
There are bathrooms at parkimg area only. Great hike, especially for autumn when the leaves change colour Awesome trail for walking and hiking One of the first places I hiked in and still one of my favorites. Sadly, I remember the days when the parking was free! LOL Other than that, it has a great mixture of flat and slightly more rugged trails that meander around a beautiful ... A nice scenic hike with somewhat easy trails.  Would recommend for the family Good trails, but in summers you can't really see the falls from where the trail ends so don't visit just for the falls Beautiful hikes and lovely waterfalls ...the hikes ranged from easy to difficult with natural inclines and walkways. The hike itself was free from jagged rocks and broken branches so it made for an enjoyable hike in beautiful Caledon. Would probably be better if we didn't go when all the trees were brown and bare. The hike up to the waterfalls unfortunately was not worth it, on the bright side our little dog enjoyed the mini lake closer to the parking lot. Great park for a short hike, and good access to the Bruce trail! The grassy, rolling hills along the meadow trail are neat. This is probably one of the best driving roads close to toronto, if not the best. There's a lot to do if you come during the day when the weather's nice. A couple of nice parks around and this one is no exception. Drive the forks as many times as you can, the hairpin is my favorite part 😉 Best getaway for a peaceful hike.
Not crowded and totally worth the walk. Good park to hike. The drive there is pretty fun if you like to rip it on backroads Nice place to be in touch with nature, but very busy on weekends It was amazing to see the nature in Fall. A really nice trail that ends with a nice waterfall. The view isn't amazing but still a nice trail Nice place to go for a scenic view Great hike! For those who need a more accessible hike keep  in mind towards the falls it walking can get pretty steep uphill and downhill. Nature at its best and well maintained park Loads of potholes at park entrance making it a bit challenging to drive into but once your in its a very nice park. Would recommend the trip as I had a lovely time. Many trials hiked. 

Bathrooms provided and pay parking Good for a day hike. The trail starts a bit flat but parts further away closer to the credit river are much nicer. It's an alright hike.  The path around the falls seems to be closed every winter which sucks. Amazing! Trails are well maintained and varied. Some sections quite steep. Connection to Bruce trail on the north section is closed at the moment Great park to go hiking for an hour, two or the day. Lots of trails to choose from, huge network of trails that are well signed making it easy to find your way and these trails connect to the Trans Canada Trail and the Bruce Trail. Easy ... Good for fall colours in early october I like to go hiking in this park particularly from the West end where it is more interesting. The waterfalls at the north end is now inaccessible due to the instability of the area. To see some of the waterfall you have to approach the area from the lower portion. Be careful. Beautiful place but to go to the falls there is no instruction about how far it is so it was really hard to walk all the way with my baby and my mom....
The park could put instructions saying you are that miles close to the fall... Great trail. Had lots of fun and you can take small children as well as it is not difficult  as all. I just wish people would not throw garbage there as that just ruins the area. Nice quiet park. Few facilities but great trails. Amazing hiking experience.. Very tough but the scenery is incredible.. A must see Went there for fossil hunting, nice and quiet place, 2 hrs to walk to the small fall, trail is also end there, we can’t walk close to the fall. Loved the walk in the park. Beautiful falls. Another great day away from the city. Such a great place to go hiking with friends. Lots of trails to pick from and good for beginners to. Only a small pet peeve is some of the trails end abruptly because it reaches a privately owned land and is fenced off. But I highly recommend this location. Beautiful area and hikes can last 4-6 hours. It's quite a long way to cataract falls. But it's worth the hike. I would rate the trail to the falls a 6/10 in difficulty. My friend and I had some moments where we were out of breath for sure. Very good place to go with family, watch out for police using radar.
Beautiful drive in any season, unbelievably beautiful in the fall. Nothing special. Not worth the visit Took about an hour to get to the falls for a not so great view of them. Lovely place and great for cardio due to the hills but the view would be better if you could get closer. Every summer I ride my motorcycle on the Forks over 15 times because if the beautiful roads and spectacular scenery.
There are only a handful of roads I go to, and I am happy to say that this is one of the top 3 that i would reccomend to ... Fun place to hike. Tons of wildlife!

Excellent place for a day getaway A beautiful little town and calm nature reserve:) Well... it’s hilly, which is very rare in Ontario. The course is short (about 7km) but somewhat fun. Parking was around 5.25 for 2 hours and about 7 dollars for four hours. I don't recall how much the full day was as I only did two hours. If you are planning to hike to the falls, I would suggest choosing four hours as it takes about an ... Beautiful and peaceful place.. Awesome to spend some quality time. I feel like I'm in a hilly area. Absolutely love this place. Peaceful and beautiful! Nice trails and clean picnic area.... This park is a nice place to spend 2 to 3 hours hiking.

To see the falls, be prepared to uphill and downhill for 60 minutes. Bring hiking poles would be wise. However, the view of the falls is not very good as the best spots are blocked ... Big park with a few different trails. The fall isn't anything special but it's a good motivator for a hike! Beautiful park with long trails that connect to the Bruce trail and the Trans Canada trail.  In the spring you can catch the lilacs blooming and have a picnic. Beautiful & Tranquil Place . Nice place to trek Good hiking route One less star for inadequate parking. The park itself is decent, the nature there isn't very striking. Gave 4 stars to the drive on the road (i.e. Mississauga rd) which runs alongside the park - it was a really windy and fun drive!

Will I visit the park again? Probably. (since, to be fair, I haven't properly explored the place) This place is nice specially in Spring and fall. I usually go there often. The drive is nice. Not enough parking spaces though!! This was a fun hike today. It took me about 35 minutes to get to the falls. The trail that normally is taken to the falls is closed because the structure is unsafe, so the park has signs like the one in the photo that show how to get to ... Very cool clean peaceful natural environment If you can take up a challenge, looking forward to reach the waterfalls from your car-park...its not for the weak hearted.

At the end of the trial is a very nice fall. The do block it off so you can't go further to see. Easy hike for all types of people.  The park is absolutely gorgeous.  I recommend checking it out in the fall the colors are stunning.  Lots of different side trails to explore and it connects with the Bruce Trail and the Trans Canada Trail.

Free of entrance. Easy hiking of flat path, the fall is very tiny (0.5m?)
Great place for hiking, close to Toronto. I love this place. Been up and down several times over the years. Quarrymans trail is lovely. The 14 dollar parking fee isn't really enforced. I've never seen anyone getting a ticket. Honestly I wish it was as it would deter the abusers ... Beautiful park...

The trails are marked so easy for everyone to use. There are various features including lakes, beautiful bridges and falls. One tjis you want to be careful of is Poison Ivy. There are lots of them in the park Great walking area. Just don't forget the mosquito repellent! Some trails are blocked at the moment so you might have to go back instead of making a loop. There is a parking lot for the parking fees that works with credit card (around 5$ for 2h). Poorly maintained facilities. Smelly washrooms without water. All provincial parks should be taken better care of. I wish government sould spend more money on parks and children's playground. I just feel disappointed because we pay so much tax then get so little. U.S. did 5 times better job on these kind of facilities.
.. Summer days are awesome here. The park abounds with insects and insect eating birds. I love the chorus of little voices coming from the surrounding trees and tall grasses.  The park is big but it's easy to find your way around thanks to the clear and we'll located signs. Easy hikes on a relatively even ground. A few hills and stairs but for the Niagara Escarpment this is one of the easier hikes. One of my favorite hiking spots in the city Took my kids here today.

The trail is pretty well maintained however over the course ... Just about my favourite place to hike, ever! And it's rarely busy, you won't bump into a lot of people on most of the trails (well, the ones that aren't right near the main office). The scenery is ever-changing and you won't get bored. Remember to get a parking pass and display it! Expansive trail network on classic rocky frontenac terrain. Interesting info center and well-maintained campsites for canoeing or hiking. Nice back country hike in campsites. Slide lake loop or big salmon lake camp sites recommended. Went to the park for some hiking and there are MANY TRAILS to.choose from.

All the photos are from a school trip to here, we are CDHS Lots of trails and places to explore here. We really enjoyed our hike and plan on returning.

It was a challenge too which is what I wanted. Swamps and fields and Canadian ... Amazing lookouts, well maintained trails. Just be aware there are ticks. Beautiful park with nice trails. Service was good. It's $15 per day per car Excellent place for beginners to backcounty camping. My 8 year old and 12 year old liked having a privy near the campsite. I like having a bear box so I didn't have to worry about hanging my food. The animals are not used to seeing people so a fawn wondered into our campsite to look at us! Clean.  Respect for nature is obvious with amount of garbage (very little).  Friendly Parks Officers. Well marked trail systems. One star based entirely on one cluster of “back country” campsites that have a very busy hiking trail going straight through them. All day long loud hikers walking by next to us and even using our toilets. Also boats pulling up to swim ... Great place for backcountry. Nice place for a day hike, trails are very well maintained. Lots of wildlife, birds. Nice clean lakes. Take big spray if you're going in the spring/summer. Love this park, have hiked a number of the trails, but never partook in the off-grid camping here (only type of camping offered).

Absolutely stunning park, lots of tent pads available and stunning views. Good for groups and small excursions with or without kids. Lovely park for hiking.

The sites are a little close together in the clusters so not a lot of privacy, but every site comes equipped with a food storage box and an enclosed privy box. One of my favourite parks in Ontario. A solid list of trails to choose from. I recommend the Slide Lake loop for a more remote trail, or the Big Salmon Lake loop for an easier hike. Lots of well maintained hiking trails with a wide variety of distances for all levels of hikers. Great park to get away for a hike. I have been to almost every camp site in this park and found that most were well taken care of and in great locations. I enjoy the diversity in landscape and lack of people. Overall, a wonderful park that I think is often underappreciated. Great introductory park to backwoods camping lots of lakes and trails are good. I was recently here for a few days and it was almost great... please note that the park is stunning including the drive up from 401. South Frontenac area is beautiful!
I am giving this 5 stars because the nature is amazing and the park ... Very Peaceful. Saw snakes, turtles, several birds including wild Turkey and of course chipmunks and squirrels. Beautiful setting and we will return. Nice park and sights. However could easily be improved by:
1. Needs to add it's trails to Google Maps so people lost can perhaps find their way and exact location using their phone GPS 
2. Needs to make some paths clearer and mark with ... A great park for camping, amazing campsite.
Staff are amazing if you won’t be there during the office hours they will provide booking over phone. Great park. Very knowledgeable and friendly warden team. Very clean and not too busy, although I did go in the middle of December. Hiking trails are well marked and camp sites are clean and well equipped. Would highly recommend a visit. Great park for hiking and interior camping very rugged and not populated just the way it should be so don't read this  and don't go there Great experience of Canadian nature... including mosquitoes.  But so much more. Great trails, well kept and well marked, and beautiful views. This has to be one of the most hiker-friendly parks I've ever been to. It was recommended by a really helpful park warden from Kawartha Highlands and it did not disappoint.

We hiked one of the loops and the trails are really well ... Love this park, though can be very muddy so wear good hiking boots! Wonderful! A perfect day, stunning scenery!! Love this place. Nice hiking and paddling options. Expensive daily rate of over $14. Other than that a decent park Compact treasure of a park. Really well-equipped sites for ""backcountry"" camping, with picnic tables, food storage boxes, outhouses. Lots of snakes, frogs, beavers, turtles and deer.
The trails are well marked and maintained. All sites ... We went for a hike in late Fall. Did not see anyone on the trail. Trails are reasonably marked,  but watch where you are going, you can loose the trail. The terrain was rugged, we are eager to explore other areas of the Park. Just got back from a 4 day camping trip to Frontenac. It's really a lovely park, with easy trails and good swimming. Makes for a rewarding and relaxing trip, but definitely not challenging. Also the sites are extremely close together, ... Good hiking trails. There are a few that you can choose depending on your ability and time. Going around the lakes and seeing the beaver dams was an interesting experience. Beware the black flies! Probably best to have a net/mesh to cover face since bug spray did not seem to work. Amazing park. Almost nothing your can't do here. Great office staff. Great park for canoe or hiking trip. The trails and sites are very well maintained. The sites are in clusters so be prepared to be camping close to others. Amazing place to hike, camp. Great location, client service was excellent.  I would add more garbages near the backpacking trail heads.  Would also be nice to have a cheap trail map available for free/small fee, instead of having to use the one found in their newspaper. Beautiful park. Well maintained. Lots of nature-y stuff. Good park. Best trees. Great place to hike and camp. Very safe. Contemplate life, fish and be at one with nature. Wonderful park with multiple well-labeled routes of various difficulty and length and countless info-plaques about the wildlife, nature and history of the respective spot. Definitely worth a visit!!

Even the lakes are nice clean lakes that taste excellent once filtered. Staff was ultra friendly and knowledgeable. Fantastic place to spend a couple of nights. This is a really nice park with some very scenic hiking and paddling opportunities. I'd recommend this place to all back country enthusiasts. Went on the May long weekend to Camp 7 site C.

Hiking to the camp site is 5 kms from the office parking lot, however the incline/decline can be +/- 80feet in some locations.

The trail is pretty well maintained however over the course ... Just about my favourite place to hike, ever! And it's rarely busy, you won't bump into a lot of people on most of the trails (well, the ones that aren't right near the main office). The scenery is ever-changing and you won't get bored. Remember to get a parking pass and display it! Expansive trail network on classic rocky frontenac terrain. Interesting info center and well-maintained campsites for canoeing or hiking. Nice back country hike in campsites. Slide lake loop or big salmon lake camp sites recommended. Went to the park for some hiking and there are MANY TRAILS to.choose from.

March 2018 : We walked the Arab Lake Gorge Trail - a walk along a boardwalk through the gorge and wetlands area, then you make your way up to the ridge for the return hike.

All the photos are from a school trip to here, we are CDHS Lots of trails and places to explore here. We really enjoyed our hike and plan on returning.

Service was good. It's $15 per day per car Excellent place for beginners to backcounty camping. My 8 year old and 12 year old liked having a privy near the campsite. I like having a bear box so I didn't have to worry about hanging my food. The animals are not used to seeing people so a fawn wondered into our campsite to look at us! Clean.  Respect for nature is obvious with amount of garbage (very little).  Friendly Parks Officers. Well marked trail systems.

Lots of wildlife, birds. Nice clean lakes. Take big spray if you're going in the spring/summer. Love this park, have hiked a number of the trails, but never partook in the off-grid camping here (only type of camping offered).

The sites are a little close together in the clusters so not a lot of privacy, but every site comes equipped with a food storage box and an enclosed privy box. One of my favourite parks in Ontario.

Lots of well maintained hiking trails with a wide variety of distances for all levels of hikers. Great park to get away for a hike. I have been to almost every camp site in this park and found that most were well taken care of and in great locations. I enjoy the diversity in landscape and lack of people.

I was recently here for a few days and it was almost great... please note that the park is stunning including the drive up from 401. South Frontenac area is beautiful!
I am giving this 5 stars because the nature is amazing and the park ... Very Peaceful. Saw snakes, turtles, several birds including wild Turkey and of course chipmunks and squirrels. Beautiful setting and we will return. Nice park and sights. However could easily be improved by:

2. Needs to make some paths clearer and mark with ... A great park for camping, amazing campsite.
Staff are amazing if you won’t be there during the office hours they will provide booking over phone. Great park. Very knowledgeable and friendly warden team.

We hiked one of the loops and the trails are really well ... Love this park, though can be very muddy so wear good hiking boots! Wonderful! A perfect day, stunning scenery!! Love this place.

The trails are well marked and maintained. All sites ... We went for a hike in late Fall. Did not see anyone on the trail. Trails are reasonably marked,  but watch where you are going, you can loose the trail. The terrain was rugged, we are eager to explore other areas of the Park. Just got back from a 4 day camping trip to Frontenac. It's really a lovely park, with easy trails and good swimming. Makes for a rewarding and relaxing trip, but definitely not challenging. Also the sites are extremely close together, ... Good hiking trails. There are a few that you can choose depending on your ability and time. Going around the lakes and seeing the beaver dams was an interesting experience. Beware the black flies! Probably best to have a net/mesh to cover face since bug spray did not seem to work.

The sites are in clusters so be prepared to be camping close to others. Amazing place to hike, camp. Great location, client service was excellent.

You won’t regret your stay and the views of the lake are amazing!
Pictures of the lots when booking online can be deceiving but they had no issue changing it up for us. We had a blast. Kids saw lots of animals, safe for riding bikes and playing with other campers. Gorgeous views and fun cliff jumping! Great camping. The park has tons of things to do. My 5 year old daughter loved the art/nature activities they had. I enjoyed the ease of renting a canoe as it was delivered directly to my site. I would definitely recommend this provincial park to my friends and family. Great camping experience. One of my favorite campgrounds and parks because it's the cleanest and the environment is the best overall. They have a variety of sites available, including electronic, trailer and group sites. If you want a place to go camping at I highly recommend here. This park is absolutely beautiful. The sites are large, clean and close to relief stations. There are lots of hiking trails and various lakes to explore via kayak, canoe or paddle board. The staff are friendly and always willing to help! The comfort stations are cleaned regularly and are newly revamped. By far my most favorite provincial park! I have been visiting Grundy for 22 years. Very well maintained park with excellent staff and wonderful sites.  Always a pleasure to camp here. Great park, I went the weekend after it was closed and it was fantastic. I brought my bike and biked around the campground without having to worry about anyone. Hiked the trails alone. It truly is a beautiful park Excellent campgrounds with good facilities. A good amount of trails to hike, views and wildlife to see. Excellent canoeing/kayaking as well as fantastic fishing. Fantastic place to go camping with the family. Lots of places to swim. Bring a canoe with you! Beautiful and small provincial park. Great for a long weekend, not much to do if you stay longer. Buy your firewood outside are the gas station. It's dry. Really great park. Lots of activities to do. Canoeing, fishing, hiking, cliff jumping and swimming. Lots of mosquitoes though. Bring a lot of bug spray. The general store just outside the park offers frozen meats, food and canoe rentals at a reasonable price. Great ice cream too. Great time with the family, park Rangers were cool even when we broke the rules a few times. Lots of bugs but hey that's camping in June for ya! And we had a little raccoon come and eat my barf lol Dog friendly, nice trails, clean facilities. Very enjoyable outside mosquito season. Nice park with lots to do.  Fair bit of highway noise...and of course several trains each night.  I'd go back. Shower/real bathrooms were very  far from our site. Everything else was great. Water access close and lake was perfect for kayaking, canoeing and swimming. Nice spot to spend  some leisure  time. Beautiful and great hiking. Didn't camp so I don't know about that experience but a lovely day trip. We go camping three times a year and this place is always our first shot of the year. Clean, boatless lake (no gasoline), amazing night sky. One of our favourites. I loved it here! Kayaking was amazing! My popup trailer rocked! Much better than  a tent😀 We love it here. Trilliums are in bloom end of May. No motors on the lakes, so great for canoeing and kayaking. Unique swimming at slippery rock and jumping rock. Hungry pike in the lakes. Great sunrises and sunsets.

That totally defeats the purpose of going camping. Went to the group site #1 and it was amazing, we were secluded from other campsite so was basically a private area for us. Had a washroom station nearby only thing we lack was electricity and shower rooms. Lake was just beside us could go fishing there or bring a boat/canoe and take off from there.

They have the best learn to camp and learn to fish programs for family or a group lot of nature trails to hike and bike as well. Amazing Nature !! Decent campground for families. Lakes are small enough to navigate by paddle and not get lost, clean water, and good cliffs for jumping and spots to set up for shore lunch. Didn't have much luck fishing for only an hour. 

Camp sites ... Going there no Canada day for Pat 5-7 year's, only thing needs more signs, some people use my site to get to the beach, happen every year, complain every year but nothing gets done.. Currently my favourite Provincial park, mind you I've really only been to 10 at the most.  Love the scenery.  They have a handful of smaller lakes which make for an awesome day out in a canoe/kayak.  They have some nice trails,  mind you ... Lots to do. Great kayaking and swimming. Decent camping. Washrooms could be improved in Jack Pine area. Bugs were bad so we didn't get a chance to do the hikes. We'll be back. Been there twice this summer already and will probably be booking again soon! Lots to see. Great trails. Beauty beach. Friendly staff. Very good place for swimming, canoeing and fishing. The 2km trail is very nice. Toilet with running water. Good for camping. We Visited at early of July, mosquito is the Only concern. Really nice hiking trails I love this Amazing park a must visit when camping in Ontario We have done camping in lots of Ontario provincial parks. This is one of the best. Very good for cayaking and canoeing if you are looking for relaxing and fun activities.  THE most beautiful provincial park in the area. Beautiful landscapes, nice big sites, lots of activities like jumping rocks, slippery rocks, hiking trails... Great park. Great hikes for all skill levels. Beautiful lakes and swimming, new comfort station. Always visit when in the area. Warning: some of the roads in this park are horrible - just a chain of linked potholes. This place has been a family fixture for decades. It has great facilities, activities for kids, fishing, hiking, camping/kayaking. The staff here are usually awesome and courteous. Beautiful  park Multiple lakes - no motors - it's perfect! Great provincial park for families. Balsam lake camping area is best for private more wooded sites. I will definitely be returning.  Beware of the mosquitoes, you'll encounter tons! Many of the campsites were flooded, which is more of mother natures fault than the parks, but they promised us a replacement site and when we got there, the site that had been discussed ... Great park, good place for canoeing. Several beaches to choose from. Though some camp sites are close to each other. Clean washrooms. Nice and professional staff.  This has become our favourite Provincial Park for the past 6 years or so, it's great to visit in the summer but even better once the kids are back in school Great park. Clean facilities, great canoeing, hiking, cliff jumping and a well stocked general store across the road for everything you forgot to pack.  Beautiful Park but way too loud. Btwn the screaming kids and parents and the chorus of barking dogs, it was very difficult to sleep let alone relax. Shame because it is a heavenly place to see. Beautiful lakes, well wooded campsites, always lovely. People have been feeding the wildlife though so be careful, they don't fear people as they should. Use precautions and don't feed the wildlife. Awesome! Beautiful! Great park The kids and I loved this park. Lots to do and see! They want to go back every year. Swimming, fishing, hiking and biking. Lots to explore. And you can try back country camping for beginners only being across the lake from your vehicle. Beautiful scenery, a little close to the highway, you can hear trucks going by at night but overall a really nice area.  Site 22 is outstanding. Great provincial campground. Good canoeing, hiking and cycling on local gravel road s Some nice sites here by the lake, rocks. Pleasant stay. We had alot of racoons while we were there, but it had been an issue recently. They ave a cliff and slide rock not advertised but really fun Beautiful provincial park not far from Perry sound . Wonderful camp sites and can't wait to come back Campsites are decent. The premium sites are really great. No motorised boats is a plus.  Great park with fuve beaches clean sites very scenic. Lost a point for putting it so close to the highway.  Who wants to hear that all night. Would have been a 5 but the fishing was not very good. Great family environment. Popular campground. Awesome swimming and hiking. I loved this place. It was described originally to me as ""not one of Ontario's premier campgrounds"", but that doesn't mean it's not great! Small bears pretty much everyday walking in and around the campground, not immediately dangerous ... The best provincial park! We have been fans of many PP'S, but this one brings us back at least once a year. The premium sites are well worth the money. The staff (even the wardons ) are awsome, clean washrooms, showers and laundry facilities. The views,  swimming, trails, fishing, canoeing, ....  can't beat this park This is my new favorite provincial park. Our site 323 was a pathway away from the water. Very bushy and fairly private. Trumpet swans, racoons were a bit of a nuisance, chipmunks, saw a pheasant on white swan  trail and we drove to Pakeshkag lake which was incrediable:) This park has an amazing lake where you can go canoeing. We went there in August and the weather was great. You better watch out for the bears and raccoons in this park as they quite frequently pass by the campsites. The park staffs are ... Quiet and relaxing atmosphere in the great north. Enjoy a quiet paddle on a small lake or winding river, or relax on a Sandy beach, or hike on one of many unique trails. Very nice place to stay for a couple of days or a week..they have 400 sites..You can tent or trailer.. I got a ticket there my FIRST time going for ""Unlawfully store wild attractants"" or something like that so basically the Ranger gave me a ticket because he assumed he seen food everywhere on my table which in reality i only had boxes of ... Three lakes with amazing views and long trails as well as good service and lots of access to the lakes for Canoes.  Great provincial park. Comfort stations are modern and clean. Canoeing, hiking, cliff jumping, biking, swimming and lot of other activities you can do over there. Beach is nice. Cliff jumping points are in gut lake. 3 spots with ... Decent campground.  Balsam lake sites were too small though and had way more mosquitoes than the other areas.  Rock jumping was great.  Bear on our campsite one day - front desk didn't seem to concerned. Very wet muddy site. Friendly staff but pitches too shaded and claustrophobic with the trees for me Very nice park but I can't get passed the wardens in bullet proof vest. That totally defeats the purpose of going camping. Went to the group site #1 and it was amazing, we were secluded from other campsite so was basically a private area for us. Had a washroom station nearby only thing we lack was electricity and shower rooms. Lake was just beside us could go fishing there or bring a boat/canoe and take off from there.  The lakes were beautiful, however we were close to the road, and there are too many campsites, rendering it fairly loud. Had a black bear circling my tent didn't sleep much Nice place Heaven on earth Beautiful park and campground. Check out the cliff jumping on Gut Lake. The Swan Lake trail is a must!  Great place. Would recommend but too many bugs Amazing place! Can't wait to go back.  Very clean national Park. Page camp sites are fun. They don't require much effort to paddle to, but offer a much quieter sure. Best campground ever. Been going for 30+ years love it! Fantastic place to camp with the family. Nature at its finest. Very beautiful at all times of the year, lots of fun for everyone. The park is  very big ,with lots of activities to do,cannoeing, swimming, fishing ,biking ,unfortunately we were there at the wrong time,it rained a lot our site was flooded and had a terrible drainage,there were a lot of mosquitoes ... We just spent a week here in July in our 18ft TT and had a good time.  We stayed in the Jack Pine section.  The sites are small (atleast in the area we were in).  There was barely enough room to setup our 10x10 screened tent, our trailer ... Great Park for weekend canoists. Caught a 22in Pike. Park roads are rough on suspension. Awesome scenic camp ground many bugs! Also quiet Nice park :) Beautiful lakes, beaches and hiking trails.  The Outfitters down the road were great. We rented a canoe for 24 hours and they delivered right to our site, all for $37 total. Great people to deal with :) We also brought our 4 ... My favourite provincial park, staff are always nice, park is clean, and the beach is the best! Would 100% recommend Great Provincial park, good amenities and lots of fun things to do!  Great camp ground, clean washroom, great family atmosphere, amazing friendly staff. Grato place beautiful view........ Oh and watch out for the bears Excellent place to camp. Beautiful scenery, great Lakes, and lots of wildlife. Careful canoeing though; it's easy to get caught by a super strong wind in the middle of the lake. Very nice great views fantastic place to camp. Bestest of all camping site.. Thick forest!! unbelievably amazing

this park is extraordinarily relaxing.
the fact that that my group played music, smoked weed and played music in a
non-radio zone makes the experience a lot better.

park warden is chill as balls

the chick at the front desk is super good looking.

And the train the goes by at night actually ... No wildlife to see. Boring park.  Maybe great for people from around that never went overboard. Having visited 38 states in the US. I can say that this is ridiculous and they charge you 14.50 CAD for a total of 7 km of hikes. A real joke ... Nice Ground campsite #3 os the largest group campsite I have ever seen in a provincial park. Access to the lake, privacy, great views a lots of wildlife. This is bear country, beware  Beautiful park, but in need of much maintenance,  pit toilets were in rough shape.  Comfort station was out of order. Roads were full of pot holes.

This place needs a huge upgrade of the electrical for the serviced site.

I love this provincial park. It has great trails along Lake Huron, the sites are private and a good size. There is a boat launch if you have a boat. Last year they put in a park for kids. Sites are large and private for the most part, the new Holmes Bay section is obviously too new to have the site coverage. All washroom facilities are clean. Staff is really friendly. The beach is narrow depending on the water levels, not over used so you can usually always find a good spot. My favourite summer spot. So refreshing. A great park for naturalists. 
Be sure to check out the 400 year old eastern white-cedar. 
Very popular with campers. The campground was great. In our area, the site was rock covered, so not the greatest for tents (which we did). Lots of trails to walk/ bike on. The beach is very narrow and can get crowded very quickly. The rock entrance to the water was uncomfortable. Would recommend to others and we will be coming back. Nice visit.  Very well kept playground and trails.  Staff helpful during shorter hours-attended to an electrical problem and provided a solution  even though it couldn't be fixed.  Clean facilities. Great camping! Sandy beach, trails, rocky beat on opposite side of the park and seasonal cabins available. Popular spot! Book in advance! Very small park, but beautiful beach and nice sites. Great place to go camping. Nice beach, nice trail along the water and lots of privacy! Great camping destination. Carry all the camping instruments and medicines.

The most beautiful sunsets around. A hidden gem! Beautiful park. Site was nice and bathrooms where clean. Haven't been to the park in several year, but i must say the service sites have improved with 50 amp sevice and with the foliage thicker than previous, the privacy has improved 10 fold Great park!

One of my all time favorite summer places to go. Not a giant park as far as parks go but there's plenty to do. Bathrooms are well maintained and clean, even the privys. Nice  campsites that are graveled so if it rains your not tramping in mud. Have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience.  Great spot, nice hiking trail around the peninsula. Beautiful spot!  Great sites, with good amount of privacy and tree cover.  Hearing the waves from pretty much anywhere on the  campground was a huge plus for us.  Only 10 minutes from Kincardine as well.

Nice views.  This was a very pretty park, but speaking as a tourist from overseas, provincial parks are too overpriced for a short visit. We only wanted to have a walk as we drove by, not come in for the day. This would have been over $14. Why not have a 'taster' price for an hour or two? Went walking on Boxing Day. Got quite chilly wandering around but enjoyed ourselves. Saw beautiful frozen Lake Huron.  It is a pristine park.  Trees! Very few mosquitos. Quiet. Private. Clean. Good staff! Helpful.

Diverse habitat nurtures rare plants and protects many woodland animals and birds.
Steeped in history. Indigenous people lived here for thousands of years. In the 1800s a small town was established in what is now part of the park.Fantastic campsite. Can't wait to stay longer next time three nights doesn't seem like enough. Lots of paths and trails love the swimming area. Both Rocky and Sandy areas depending on what you want to do. Kids enjoy jumping off the rocks. If you are a camping advocate this place is a must. Recently updated facilities and sites. Very private large sites. This place needs a huge upgrade of the electrical for the serviced site.
we needed 100 for of electrical cord to reach the plug-in. Luckily the camp store rents out extra ... We loved camping here!!  You can choose from private, semi private or general camping sites. A beautiful sun set can be seen from the beach at the park.  The men's and women's washrooms were both nice and clean. Park reps were great to ... Stayed in one of the rental cabins (built just last year I believe).  

Cabin was quite nice, very clean, in the shade most of the day so it didn’t get too hot.  Cabin features a microwave, small fridge (with icebox), coffee maker, ... Beautiful provincial park...great for biking, exploring...even an old settlers cemetery to respectfully visit.  Beach is great.  Sites in Holmes Bay are spacious and private.

I love this provincial park. It has great trails along Lake Huron, the sites are private and a good size. There is a boat launch if you have a boat. Last year they put in a park for kids. Sites are large and private for the most part, the new Holmes Bay section is obviously too new to have the site coverage. All washroom facilities are clean. Staff is really friendly. The beach is narrow depending on the water levels, not over used so you can usually always find a good spot. My favourite summer spot. So refreshing. A great park for naturalists. 
Be sure to check out the 400 year old eastern white-cedar. 
Very popular with campers. The campground was great. In our area, the site was rock covered, so not the greatest for tents (which we did). Lots of trails to walk/ bike on. The beach is very narrow and can get crowded very quickly. The rock entrance to the water was uncomfortable. Would recommend to others and we will be coming back. Nice visit.  Very well kept playground and trails.  Staff helpful during shorter hours-attended to an electrical problem and provided a solution  even though it couldn't be fixed.  Clean facilities. Great camping! Sandy beach, trails, rocky beat on opposite side of the park and seasonal cabins available. Popular spot! Book in advance! Very small park, but beautiful beach and nice sites. Great place to go camping. Nice beach, nice trail along the water and lots of privacy! Great camping destination. Carry all the camping instruments and medicines. There will be a nice beach to spend day time. Wood for camp fire is available at the door. Be little careful about black fly. Nice beach and one end of beach is open for pets to come as well.

Très beau parc!","The rushing Englehart River plunges down white-water rapids, over several cascades and waterfalls in a picturesque valley
Surrounded by forest, a convenient and pleasant campground sits high above the river, located just off Highway 11, two kilometers south of Englehart
Many walking, photography, bird-watching and hiking opportunities in the Englehart River valleyNice scenery however it is not clear how to get to falls, need some signs , especially if the road is closed for vehicles as it was and therefore people must walk . Really like this park. If you need to get away and enjoy nature. This is a great spot. I proposed to my wife here on a hike. It was beautiful & turned out great!! I bet this park, in its day, was beautiful. Unfortunately vandals, lack of maintenance and time did a number on this gem. Needs some serious attention. The scenery is breathtaking but is hindered by overgrowth of trees and weeds. The ... Beautiful place. Well maintained and awe inspiring.  Perfect day use spots. Nice looking campsites and trailer turn arounds. Reasonable fees. A beautiful peaceful paradise.  Perfect for intimate interludes amongst the flora and fauna.  The romance of the rushing river and tumbling falls all add up to a beautiful experience for couples who appreciate nature. 💖 It appeared to be unmaintained. The  footbridge across the river is boarded up, preventing it's use. The pavement is often cracked with tall weeds. The map flyer is inaccurate, which messed up our attempt to find the picnic area. Great place.  We love that it is natural and wild. Poor maintained. But still beautiful. Amazing park! Proposed to my fiance here! Lots to see. Great trails & views. Beautiful. Have been here for a second time in three years. The park has had a lot of work done to it as the facilities are clean fully stocked, and sites have electricity, just don't think the water as it has not been tested.

Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,"Did you know - Kawartha Highlands Signature Site Park is the largest park in southern Ontario after Algonquin Provincial Park?
It is a special place with many opportunities for you to experience the outdoors ranging from backcountry canoeing and camping to a short hike. Before visiting please be aware that, unlike some parks you may be familiar with, the access points at Kawartha don’t have a lot of facilities including limited parking.
Ontario Parks wants everyone to have a safe and enjoyable time when visiting the park no matter what activity you participate in. We ask that all visitors be responsible and prepared for whatever activity you plan on participating in at the park. Please stick to designated trails and portages and be respectful of other park visitors and the natural environment at all times.
Always remember some key safety tips in and around water – use life-jackets, plan your trip and be prepared for uneven backcountry terrain.
We want all our visitors to have fun and make lasting memories. If you are planning on coming to the park consider contacting park staff so they can help you make the most of your visit.","106 Monck Street, Box 500 Bancroft, ON K0L 1C0",,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Amazing national park but it’s tough to find good companies to rent canoes/kayaks from. We’ve had bad experiences with two different places. The park itself it worth 5 stars though Great place. Yes you have wildlife that should be left alone.
DON'T CHASE THE LOONS
DON'T CHASE THE TURTLES. If you see a turtle on a road, move it to the side it was going towards.
RUN away from the bears
If you catch fish that can be released, release them. Then someone can catch them later. After a long and winding drive from the main road Google maps said we had reached - but where?

It was just trees on both sides and a gravel road.It was kind of scary too as it was isolated and very few cars.
I guess we need to make a ... Cool trail. Squirrels seem to have a gold tip tail for some reason.... Just wrapped up a trip to site 301 and it was awesome. Shooting stars at night, long swims during the day... you'd almost want the water to be cooler in August. The park staff are amazing. I forgot to display my permit and was ticketed ... Nice trails. And lots of snow at the rite time of year. We rented a cottage here.

All the sites are water access only and plenty private.  Big sites with several options for where to setup.  Just spent a night at Cold Lake and was the only person there.  By far the best remote site close to Toronto. Great provincial park. We rented a canoe and enjoyed some paddling and picnic. Looking forward to going back! Camped on sucker lake site 122.   Was beautiful.   2 portages to get there.  Both portages were short but steep and had lots of roots and rocks on the portage hills. Did 5 night canoe camping trip.  Lakes stayed at were Secret, Buzzard, Shark and Stoplog.  Secret and Shark are very picturesque with no cottages, Buzzard is nice too.  Campsites were spaced far apart which gives a very remote ambiance. ... One of the best camping experiences I've had. Private camping. Not expensive. Good fishing. Peaceful as can be. Our favorite place to visit each year. The sites are very well maintained and always stocked with fire wood upon our arrival. 3 day trip into Mountain lake. Wind at our back on Long both ways! Under 4 hrs with 2 decent portage, a great private lake to ourselves. Really nice place.  If you want an intro to back country camping this is a great place to start Peace & Calm, collect your thoughts surrounded by nature. If you love the outdoors and dislike the loud car campers like me well this is the place for you! Just a short paddle in and you can start enjoying nature at its best!

It is still a new park so it should get better with time but it is pretty good now We camped in Cold Lake, which was beautiful!  Handy to have the sandbar beach nearby for the kids - a real hit!  Must have forgotten when booking that a picnic table was provided - a nice surprise, along with a fire ring (fire ban ... We had a wonderful back country canoe trip! Some obnoxious cottagers on Anstruther Lake, just paddle past them! Too close to cottagers but otherwise awesome!! Our trip was HARD! We camped at Stoplog Site # 564. It took us 2 hrs to go from Long Lake to end of Loucks Lake, then the portages (90m+397m+70m) was a killer took us about approx. 45 mins, then Compass Lake is nice and easy approx 30 ... Nice place to visit for a relaxing day. I've been coming to the park since I was a kid. Every lake has it's own charm to it. The further you portage in, the quieter and untouched they get.

We stayed at Bottle Lake for 2 nights, and Sucker Lake for 2 nights. Sucker Lake seemed to be a lot more quiet. The island site on Sucker Lake was nice because of the lack of squirrels and raccoons, but it was fairly exposed, and thus, rather windy. Website could be more specific on portage slope, terrain, difference in height... Easier to evaluate difficulty of routes. Publishing the status of beaver dams, water level or density of vegetation could be helpful too. Super nice and clean lakes. Further you go from the main lakes and routes, nicer becomes the experience. Beautiful natural setting with no power boats once you get into the back country. Great paddling, beautiful views, pleasant swimming in clear and clean lakes. Take out what you bring in to keep is beautiful for the next visit. Great spot for intro level backcountry canoe camping.

Nice to have sites accessible  by canoe without portage as my ankle was recovering from injury ... We haven't used the park overnight, but we've used the side trail near Buckhorn and it's a nice easy hike to a cool spot at the end of the trail. I enjoy this park. This park mainly for canoeing, not ideal for hiking or biking. It's best once you get off the lakes with boats and cottages. We've seen deer and beaver : ) Absolutely beautiful.

Take a canoe trip north of Anstruther Lake.  It is absolutely beautiful. Amazing park, lots of lakes and rivers. Tons of fun.  As tranquil as you can dream of! Heaven on earth.  I am very saddened by my experience with Kawartha. I have been in 7 different parks, and this is by far the worst.  It costs about twice as much than other parks, but you get half the facilities and  wilderness. There is no visitor desk, ... Charging now to park outrageous I've been going to lakes long before it became a park now ur gonna pay  A beautiful area.  They are starting to create too many sites within the park though making the back-country crowded Such a wonderful region! Plenty to do and see!

Beautiful lakes, perfect weekend getaway location. Best kept secret in North Kawartha Simple and sweet Kawartha's gem...Just one problem with trapping cabins close or on the same Lake you camp at...So there could be live active traps close by when looking for dead stands for firewood...Be cautious when traveling through the back of your campsite!

Killarney Provincial Park,"This iconic 645 square kilometre wilderness landscape showcases the wild Georgian Bay Coast of pink granite; the La Cloche Mountains’ white quartzite ridges and over 50 exceptionally clear, sapphire lakes set among Jack Pine hills.
The area has long captivated artists including The Group of Seven’s A.Y. Jackson, Franklin Carmichael and A.J. Casson, so much so, that they persuaded the Ontario government to make it a park.
Extensive backcountry canoeing and sea kayaking experiences.
Outstanding hiking including the 80 km, looped, La Cloche-Silhouette Trail, as well as cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in winter.
George Lake campground, with access to beaches, trails, and canoeing.
Yurt accommodation available year-round.
Historic Village of Killarney, founded in 1820 as a fur trading post on Georgian Bay, 10 km from park and home of the famous Herbert Fisheries fish and chips.","960 Highway #637 Killarney, ON P0M 2A0",,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,"Awesome and amazing nature, hope to see this preserved for many years to come. The La Cloche trail is great and people on it are nice. Way nicer than people at The Crack. Going through the Crack ruins the experience due to litter, impoliteness, and well it's nearing the end of you're going clockwise. wonderful, and beautiful. Went four years In a row, and it just as good every time. Pack up, and go for hike with you're friends for a few nights it's great. We just went to hike along a trail.  We didn't camp. Parking for the day was 15$.  We took the shortest hike, 
Granite Ridge, posted as mild - moderate, with some steep parts.  It was posted at 1 and a half to 2 hours.  It was beautiful. ... Go ALL THE WAY to the end of the road! GAS is available.  Worth the drive. Fish n chip place is good, shops are cool, Prov park awesome. Went sailing right off the dock, took the tourboat anther time. Very enjoyable! A beautiful getaway just a few hours north of Toronto. I enjoyed summer hiking and camping in the AB campsites. We even saw a baby black bear run across our site in the morning. This park is what more of Ontario should look like. We went on a canoe trip through Bell Lake - Three Mile - Balsam - Deacon on the way in. Stayed 2 nights on the island camp site on Deacon Lake. The first night, we hunkered down through the 80km/hr the storm (remnants of Florence). We ... Had an incredible trip here last October. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a true escape. Hiking and canoeing we ran into 3 people over 4 days, total privacy on back country camp sites. Check in and cost were very reasonable. 

Note: We didn’t encounter any bugs or much wildlife in October. Stunning. An absolute gem. The photo below was taken at the portage between George and Freeland Lake. All Canadians must go at least once in their life. Killarney Provincial Park is one of my favorite places in Ontario. Breathtaking scenery. We camped at site 126 at George Lake 26th to 28th June 2015. Weather was great. Nights were lovely. Not too warm or cold. Wash rooms and water tap ... An absolutely spectacular experience!!! The quartzite rock, the backcountry grandeur, the clear water... my favourite portaging park hands down. Be sure to hike silver peak...leave a full day for that! You’ll be glad you did! So beautiful! Like a group of 7 painting. Trails are all great, but start at moderate level. Plan for mosquitoes and keeping your site bear safe.  We stayed in a yurt. The only thing I would have brought that we didn't think of was a fan, as it was stuffy under the mid day sun A beautiful, serene and quiet place to bring family or go with friends. The Crack trail was quiet challenging but worth it once you reach the top. Wasn't lucky with the fishing, but nonetheless would come back! Awsome place. Excellent trekking trails. Very pretty. Carry plenty water, fully charged electronics, cause once you enter, things are hard to come by. Beautiful landscape, great facilities and services. Highly recommended for backcountry canoeing, but you need to book really far ahead of time. As a group we canoe during the shoulder seasons every year somewhere in northern Ontario.  Killarney Provincial Park offers challenging portages and incredible scenery...this time we stayed on O.S.A. lake on the big island....awesome.  Would highly recommend this as a camping/hiking or canoeing destination to anyone. My favourite provincial park. The sights are amazing, the people are amazing,  and so is the fish and chips truck just outside the park. It is far away from the big city but well worth the travel time to get there. Not as big as ... Try and visit every year. Favourite park in 9ntario. La Cloche Trail is breathtaking. And actually moderately challenging! As a park is amazing.
But the rangers need more training.
Not enough information of which camps are free. They said... go and see and if is occupied then paddle to next one (Lake George camps).
They need a better system.
But, once in nature that human factor is not relevant anymore. I love this park. It's so big, you can keep coming back and discover new places. We went hiking along the La Cloche Trail and booked a campsite along there, H2 Lumsden. So secluded, beautiful site and a whole lake to ourselves. The staff ... Amazing & beautiful park. It is worth to drive around 4 + hours from Toronto. We camp near George lake and beach is so nice. There are small cliffs even kids can dive to water. If you are hiking don't miss granite trail (start near the park office ) , you can spot even Manitoulin island and light house too. So beautiful. The backcountry trails are challenging and the campsites lovely. Recommend fall when mosquitos and black flies are absent. Killarney has a well-deserved reputation as a spectacular wilderness park. It doesn't matter which direction you enter the park from.  It's all beautiful. The white quartzite of the La Cloche mountains never fails to impress. Unspoiled beauty and no crowds are a great combination. Enjoy! It's a beautiful park, the crack was more difficult than I thought it was going to be but very much worth the hike! The beach view was amazing. The camp site we choose was cramped and not very private at all, we could see everything our neighbor campers were doing. Love killarney didnt want to leave. This place is absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and there is so much to explore. Perfect place for the outdoorsy people. The Killarney outpost store is really cool place to check out as well as the coast by the light house is breath taking. Extremely gorgeous park. Did a canoe trip here and had the time of my life . Quiet but remote. If prepared for the initial 300m portage, Massauga is almost as good but a lot easier to access We hiked (walk, stop, collect acorns, eat at the top, rest, enjoyed the view) slowly for 2.5 hours (1 hour up, 1 hour eating and enjoying the top, 1/2 hour down) the short part of Granite Ridge trail (we didn't do the long loop just came ... Gorgeous scenery. Campsites are great, amenities are close to the sites. Trails are well marked. Great service. Very nice car camp sites. Lots of trees
  No services at camp sites.  Lots of trails, nice beach.  Telescope for supervised group activity. I went here for Victoria day weekend and, barring some unfortunate rain, it was a great time. Camping is one of the few times I want to be in the middle of nowhere, and this is where Killarney thrives. There's a small town a few dozen ... We had a very pleasant experience hiking throughout the park. All the bikes we completed were scenic, not difficult for a 30 year old, and enjoyable. Bring water! 
We drove around the main camping location and it looks good, but we ... First canoe trip in 35 years. What a great adventure. The camping area has 5/5 shower facilities to get yourself cleaned up for the drive home. Looking forward to the next time. This place is beautiful. The water is crystal clear, the scenery is outstanding, and the nearby town of Killarney is a really nice compliment. The trek down the highway is longer than you'd expect, but being only an hour and a half away from Sudbury, I'd put it high on a must visit list. 100km hike what can I say.  It ain't the parks fault.  Do it This is the first time I have come so late in the season. It was a pleasant surprise to see it full as usual but with more serious campers. I do not see campers not taking care of garbage properly like I have in previous times I have ... BEAUTIFUL park! Stayed in the radio-free part of the park and it was exactly what we wanted to relax in nature. The wind coming off the lake was very cold, but with multiple layers it was okay! My only wish is that people wouldn't bring ... Gorgeous place. Clean great kayaking, exploring, swimming and fun for the whole family...make sure to get gas early on before getting tot he park because the only gas station is in town is much more expensive and hard to get into if you have a trailer. A beautiful park. If travelling in the summer, I highly recommend checking the bug report on The Weather Network's website. Take it seriously and don't feel self-conscious about purchasing a bug-net suit. You won't be the only one, and ... my favourite provincial park so far The hike was pretty intense, well for me maybe but this place is truly beautiful. If you haven't gone you have to at least visit once! You won't regret it! This place is a true hidden gem.  

My family has been visiting George Lake every year for over half a century, camping, portaging, hiking, and just enjoying the beautiful sights and scenery and it never gets old.  Majestic old growth ... So much to do and explore. Our site was clean, campground is small and quiet, bathrooms and comfort stations were clean. Beach is decent. Only downside is you have to leave the campground to rent canoes or kayaks from the Outfitters Great park with lots of great camping areas and trails This park is so beautiful. Some of the portages can be a bit daunting like the 3000+ m into Three Narrows (well in bug season at least). But it is well worth it. And a lot of the park can be accessed by day users! I wasn't able to make it to the top of the crack trail but what an amazing veiw It is a beautiful park.  Even as cold as it was when we were there. Beautiful Park.  Make sure you have a reservation.  When you turn off highway 69, your still about a hour away from the park. Beautiful park, kind of remote from Toronto, but has a nice and relaxing atmosphere. Good for ""meeting"" wildlife. Met a black bear on one of the trails. Offers posibilities of camping in tents and trailers (better book well in advance) but also backcountry and canoe campsites. As a landscape photographer I definitely recommend this national park to anyone in Ontario. Its one of the best national parks in Ontario let alone Canada! Lots of trails, camping spots and enough challenging terrain for all fitness ... Love how many trails there are and had a great time! Used campsite in the 20's it was well away from everyone else. Saw a beaver while canoeing! Everyone was very dog friendly and that made it an easier and comfy place to be. Great ... Such a scenic place. Must book well in advance or get lucky unless you are going further into the park. An absolutely beautiful park with lots of activities for year round camping and hiking. One of my favorite camping destinations Great experience! Had alot of fun kayaking, fishing and hiking. Killarney has beautiful views and landscapes. Unfortunately I came during a fire ban but that doesnt change how great my time was. Crystal clear waters of the cold Georgian Bay waters hugging Killarney’s shores decorated by polished pink and white granite rock formation, with dark northern green pines whistling through the strong northerly winds against an usually ... Nice campsite! Large beach and gorgeous hiking trails within the park. Amazing vistas, beautiful hikes and lakes. Would definitely recommend OSA or Killarney lakes for you camping spots Great experience went and unlocked a van in the middle of the night . Never a dull moment in the tow bizz Beautiful park. But to see its  beauty you must hiking or kayaking. I'm reluctant to tell you how much I love this park. We go backcountry. Very hard to get a reservation to a great Lake but damn! It's very Wabi - Especially when the weather is inclement. Competent staff. They need to address the bear- hang problem - too many broken branches This provincial park is located on a channel of lake George and has clear high ph water over granite rocks. This was our 3rd family camping trip and we can't wait to go back next year! The Crack is the best hike I have ever done and worth every second. It's a difficult hike with plenty of uphill. Very beautiful place and the trails are definitely a challenge too! Great visit to Killarney. Backcountry camping was awesome! The sites we stayed at were all gorgeous. Will definitely be back! Had an awesome back country canoe trip including hiking Silver Peak, highly recommend! Classic Georgian Bay park but very quiet. Starting at Three Mile Lake, we saw 6 other paddlers over a 4 night stay. Some tough portages probably deter most. With how much hype there is about killarney I must say I was disappointed. The park was nice although I didn't love that they only have outhouses. There is nice hiking trails and the beach was just just down the road from our site. Would ... Had a blast hiking the Cranberry bog trail. Had some pretty scenic views. I can’t wait to go back again. Loved everything but the bugs! Absolutely beautiful! Will go back. Lovely park, with good camping. We’ve enjoyed camping here as kids and now bring our own. There’s a good amount to do in the area. We were fortunate to have a few bear sights on our trips over the years, both on the roads and strolling throughout the park. Great park! Went portaging for a few days and had a wonderful experience. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable, scenery was beautiful, and park was not crowded. If you're looking for a little one on one with nature THIS is the place to do it. Beautiful park! I love the white quartzite. We did the la cloche trail over 5 days and it was amazing! A classic, amazing public piece of Canada... Beautiful scenery, lots of trails, excellent camping spots. Sites are large and roomy. Staff was very friendly and helpful Been coming up since I was a little kid. Love it! Always hated my name till I found out I was named after this beautiful park, I adore going up there to this day. I would go back in a heart beat. Do yourself a favour and rent a canoe/kayak and do a portage or two. The rock faces are breath taking. Also, go to the crack! Come early for the non reservable camp sites. The crack trail is a about 4 hours long with beautiful views. I would recommend the chickenising trail which is also close by and shorter with better views. Beautiful provincial park. Beautiful quartzite rounded hills, trails, beautiful canoeing. Good camp sites. You must preserve the water quality because it is rejuvenating from mine pollution atmospheric deposition. The views from the hills are beautiful. Saw a bear that ran away fast. Chikanishing Trail
Great views and amazing lanscapes. Stunning amazing, worth the drive, lots of lakes hiking trails, camping sites both drive in and canoe in only Love this place theres everything and more here Trails swimming and gorgeous Wild life the mosquitoes were heavy this year but got my little gazebo Several trails, hard or easy, good for either family with kids or backpacker. My family found it tres easy to make a ritual of vacationing here every Summer. 

Over the years we've noticed a steady increase in both campground and backcountry camping (i.e. interior canoeing and hiking). The park and  campground are ... Best hiking trails. Beautiful scenery. Loved my first backcountry camping experience in Killarney. Felt like I was in the middle of a Group of Seven painting. Back country camping, canoeing and sketching with friends was a good time.  The park is slowly repairing from damage caused by the nickel mining and refining in Sudbury which caused so much human suffering.

The recuperation of the land ... Beautiful area.  Good for kayaking and canoing...well worth the drive there. I will visit this place again <3 A great park! I recommend going to the Silver Peak as it has the greatest view of the park, and going to the Topaz Lake on the way back, both hikes take around 6 hours and include canoeing, hiking and bouldering! Great hiking trails! Great place for backcountry camping This hike was crazy good. Make sure to have some hiking shoes. A beautiful place even in raining weather. Beautiful place awesome and breathtaking natural scenery not too expensive as long as you have all the gears and everything this is a must see place for everyone. Back-Country Camping  is amazing!! Loved the calm/clean water and clean sites. Silver Peak is worth climbing and give about 4-6 good hrs towards it. Beautiful park
 It was nice and quiet when we went, at the end of August/beginning of September. There were bears throughout the park though but there were no issues. They were simply present, which was honestly neat because we got a great view of some bears! I have been coming to Killarney since before I could walk. It is one of the most incredible little places to go to in Canada, little own Ontario. The Georgian Bay inlet allows for great fishing trips, as well as be surrounded by many ... One of the most beautiful places on earth. Very nice but the rucuns burn the nights. One of the best park. Amazing Trails especially The Crack and active Wildlife. 
Don't miss The Crack (Spectacular View). It is almost Hard but it is worth seeing it. Killarney is a fantastic park with stunning scenery, the camp site at George Lake is set within dense forest and thus plagued by mosquitoes. If you visit during a fire ban this makes for an uncomfortable time. My favourite Ontario provincial park Awesome Provincial park. My family and I drove from Hunstville up to Killarney and this park does not dissapoint. Although we were only here for around 2 hours the views never dissapointed. For sure going back to try out their 2 day durated trail. We had a great weekend at the park. We went mid June so there were not many other groups there. The camping spaces are large and flat. Lots of space to set up tents and vehicles. There is a dog beach and some really nice hiking trails. The washrooms are maintained very well.  If you're looking for a great challenging hike this is a great place. It's awesome during fall season. Beautiful views. Everyone who lives in Ontario should make time sometime in their lives to visit this provincial park. There are dozens of different canoe routes, hundreds of campsites, a bunch of hiking trails and a ton of lakes to swim in. The lakes ... Beautiful, well kept park.  Amazing hikes from moderate to difficult to choose from. Beautiful, clean, friendly and helpful staff!! For canoeists, hikers and tents primarily. Not really the best park for rv's or trailers on George lakesides, Trout Creek has bigger sites, but no electrical sites, or water fill  available. The scenery at Killbear PP is more to our ... Absolutely love this park! Great spot for winter glamping and winter activities. The crack in winter time is always a beautiful hike.

Hope they'll improve that in the future. My favorite Ontario park Beautiful park. We arrived really late and the park attendants were gone. Called the warden who told us to pick a site and pay on the way out. Very accommodating. The showers were huge and the water pressure was excellent. I have been in the Killarney provincial park three times. Each time brought back wonderful memories. What a great place to go! It's a life changing experience to be out in the  beautiful natural scenery. I'd totally recommend going. Great time, great weather, great craic and Crack trail! Hey Google it's a provincial park. You have it as a state park. Beautiful park, even better if you can paddle in and get away from crowds. One of the worst Provincial parks we stayed at, at the end of a long crappy road that you must drive back out of when you leave.  Not much to do unless you like mosquitoes!!!! Beautiful. Words aren't enough. Camped here this past weekend and it was absolutely beautiful. Stayed in site #60, privacy wasn't too great but I didn't mind having close neighbors if it meant having more people on bear patrol! Visitor center, comfort stations, and ... Great place Love this park Just beautiful, stunning landscapes and quiet wilderness! Backcountry camping and canoeing was amazing. We saw moose and Ontario wildlife. It's a great escape from the business of the big cities. Just a recommendation: you should may be ... Nice launch ramp and parking at the creek.

Great campround and nice views. The canoeing was also really nice, even if it was a bit expensive. Mosquito infested swampy waters. Awesome Provincial Park. This park is roughly 5 hours from Toronto which makes it a little more quiet than the other provincial parks we have visited in the past. It is nice to enjoy the outdoors without running into so many other ... One of the most beautiful parks. Always look forward to my trips there The views are amazing. We went portaging and the trip was amazing. Lots of beautiful moments and I would love to go back. We did camp at sites that had lots of mosquitoes so bring bug spray and be prepared to get bitten. OSA is such a stunning lake. Pick up a 'Jeff's Map' from Killarney outfitters & get into it!

Beware the Ontario parks' reservation staff who are based outside of the park & have no idea what they're doing. We were told our reservations ... It's a long drive in to beautiful scenic park. If you like roughing it, this is the place. Camp at the grounds or canoe and portage in to the interior. Some of the Group of Seven did their best work here. Kayaking, canoeing, swimming, hiking and overall beauty of this park is amazing. We kayaked on Philip Edward Island in the Georgian bay and it was a great experience. We stayed on George Lake Campground, number 29. Down side is there ... Fantastic Canada Day weekend! A beautiful park with varied terrain and countless rivers to explore. Nice wilderness park. Gate staff were tired and not exactly friendly. Our site was isolated by choice but quite buggy due to small stream running through it. Beautiful canoeing possible. Always a great place to be outdoors Great park . Beautiful landscapes. Great for hiking,canoeing, camping and more. The Crack and Silver peak are famous for hiking. George lake for camping and day use. Plus they have bell lake and other lakes too.  Can't say enough good things about this park. It's like stepping into another world. The quartz mountains are amazing.  3 adults and 2 kids we rented one of the cabins, it was very well equiped. Lakes everywhere, plenty of hiking trails. We hiked the Crack which is a must. i suffered the hikes and heat to thot on insta Breathtaking views, great for small groups and people who enjoy hiking in general.

The area has long captivated artists including The Group of Seven’s A.Y. Jackson, Franklin Carmichael and A.J. Casson, so much so, that they persuaded the Ontario government to make it a park.
Extensive backcountry canoeing and sea kayaking experiences.
Outstanding hiking including the 80 km, looped, La Cloche-Silhouette Trail, as well as cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in winter.
George Lake campground, with access to beaches, trails, and canoeing.
Yurt accommodation available year-round.
Historic Village of Killarney, founded in 1820 as a fur trading post on Georgian Bay, 10 km from park and home of the famous Herbert Fisheries fish and chips.Awesome and amazing nature, hope to see this preserved for many years to come. The La Cloche trail is great and people on it are nice. Way nicer than people at The Crack. Going through the Crack ruins the experience due to litter, impoliteness, and well it's nearing the end of you're going clockwise. wonderful, and beautiful. Went four years In a row, and it just as good every time. Pack up, and go for hike with you're friends for a few nights it's great. We just went to hike along a trail.  We didn't camp. Parking for the day was 15$.  We took the shortest hike, 
Granite Ridge, posted as mild - moderate, with some steep parts.  It was posted at 1 and a half to 2 hours.  It was beautiful. ... Go ALL THE WAY to the end of the road! GAS is available.  Worth the drive. Fish n chip place is good, shops are cool, Prov park awesome. Went sailing right off the dock, took the tourboat anther time. Very enjoyable! A beautiful getaway just a few hours north of Toronto. I enjoyed summer hiking and camping in the AB campsites. We even saw a baby black bear run across our site in the morning. This park is what more of Ontario should look like. We went on a canoe trip through Bell Lake - Three Mile - Balsam - Deacon on the way in. Stayed 2 nights on the island camp site on Deacon Lake. The first night, we hunkered down through the 80km/hr the storm (remnants of Florence). We ... Had an incredible trip here last October. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a true escape. Hiking and canoeing we ran into 3 people over 4 days, total privacy on back country camp sites. Check in and cost were very reasonable. 

Note: We didn’t encounter any bugs or much wildlife in October. Stunning. An absolute gem. The photo below was taken at the portage between George and Freeland Lake. All Canadians must go at least once in their life. Killarney Provincial Park is one of my favorite places in Ontario. Breathtaking scenery.

The quartzite rock, the backcountry grandeur, the clear water... my favourite portaging park hands down. Be sure to hike silver peak...leave a full day for that! You’ll be glad you did! So beautiful! Like a group of 7 painting. Trails are all great, but start at moderate level. Plan for mosquitoes and keeping your site bear safe.  We stayed in a yurt. The only thing I would have brought that we didn't think of was a fan, as it was stuffy under the mid day sun A beautiful, serene and quiet place to bring family or go with friends. The Crack trail was quiet challenging but worth it once you reach the top. Wasn't lucky with the fishing, but nonetheless would come back! Awsome place. Excellent trekking trails. Very pretty. Carry plenty water, fully charged electronics, cause once you enter, things are hard to come by. Beautiful landscape, great facilities and services.

Not as big as ... Try and visit every year. Favourite park in 9ntario. La Cloche Trail is breathtaking. And actually moderately challenging! As a park is amazing.
But the rangers need more training.
Not enough information of which camps are free. They said... go and see and if is occupied then paddle to next one (Lake George camps).
They need a better system.
But, once in nature that human factor is not relevant anymore. I love this park. It's so big, you can keep coming back and discover new places. We went hiking along the La Cloche Trail and booked a campsite along there, H2 Lumsden. So secluded, beautiful site and a whole lake to ourselves. The staff ... Amazing & beautiful park. It is worth to drive around 4 + hours from Toronto. We camp near George lake and beach is so nice. There are small cliffs even kids can dive to water. If you are hiking don't miss granite trail (start near the park office ) , you can spot even Manitoulin island and light house too. So beautiful. The backcountry trails are challenging and the campsites lovely. Recommend fall when mosquitos and black flies are absent. Killarney has a well-deserved reputation as a spectacular wilderness park. It doesn't matter which direction you enter the park from.  It's all beautiful. The white quartzite of the La Cloche mountains never fails to impress. Unspoiled beauty and no crowds are a great combination. Enjoy! It's a beautiful park, the crack was more difficult than I thought it was going to be but very much worth the hike! The beach view was amazing. The camp site we choose was cramped and not very private at all, we could see everything our neighbor campers were doing. Love killarney didnt want to leave. This place is absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and there is so much to explore. Perfect place for the outdoorsy people. The Killarney outpost store is really cool place to check out as well as the coast by the light house is breath taking. Extremely gorgeous park. Did a canoe trip here and had the time of my life . Quiet but remote.

We had a very pleasant experience hiking throughout the park. All the bikes we completed were scenic, not difficult for a 30 year old, and enjoyable. Bring water! 
We drove around the main camping location and it looks good, but we ... First canoe trip in 35 years. What a great adventure. The camping area has 5/5 shower facilities to get yourself cleaned up for the drive home. Looking forward to the next time. This place is beautiful. The water is crystal clear, the scenery is outstanding, and the nearby town of Killarney is a really nice compliment. The trek down the highway is longer than you'd expect, but being only an hour and a half away from Sudbury, I'd put it high on a must visit list. 100km hike what can I say.  It ain't the parks fault.  Do it This is the first time I have come so late in the season. It was a pleasant surprise to see it full as usual but with more serious campers. I do not see campers not taking care of garbage properly like I have in previous times I have ... BEAUTIFUL park! Stayed in the radio-free part of the park and it was exactly what we wanted to relax in nature. The wind coming off the lake was very cold, but with multiple layers it was okay! My only wish is that people wouldn't bring ... Gorgeous place. Clean great kayaking, exploring, swimming and fun for the whole family...make sure to get gas early on before getting tot he park because the only gas station is in town is much more expensive and hard to get into if you have a trailer. A beautiful park. If travelling in the summer, I highly recommend checking the bug report on The Weather Network's website. Take it seriously and don't feel self-conscious about purchasing a bug-net suit. You won't be the only one, and ... my favourite provincial park so far The hike was pretty intense, well for me maybe but this place is truly beautiful. If you haven't gone you have to at least visit once! You won't regret it! This place is a true hidden gem.  

My family has been visiting George Lake every year for over half a century, camping, portaging, hiking, and just enjoying the beautiful sights and scenery and it never gets old.  Majestic old growth ... So much to do and explore. Our site was clean, campground is small and quiet, bathrooms and comfort stations were clean. Beach is decent. Only downside is you have to leave the campground to rent canoes or kayaks from the Outfitters Great park with lots of great camping areas and trails This park is so beautiful. Some of the portages can be a bit daunting like the 3000+ m into Three Narrows (well in bug season at least). But it is well worth it. And a lot of the park can be accessed by day users! I wasn't able to make it to the top of the crack trail but what an amazing veiw It is a beautiful park.  Even as cold as it was when we were there. Beautiful Park.  Make sure you have a reservation.  When you turn off highway 69, your still about a hour away from the park. Beautiful park, kind of remote from Toronto, but has a nice and relaxing atmosphere. Good for ""meeting"" wildlife.

But to see its  beauty you must hiking or kayaking. I'm reluctant to tell you how much I love this park. We go backcountry. Very hard to get a reservation to a great Lake but damn!

They need to address the bear- hang problem - too many broken branches This provincial park is located on a channel of lake George and has clear high ph water over granite rocks. This was our 3rd family camping trip and we can't wait to go back next year! The Crack is the best hike I have ever done and worth every second. It's a difficult hike with plenty of uphill.

Had an awesome back country canoe trip including hiking Silver Peak, highly recommend! Classic Georgian Bay park but very quiet. Starting at Three Mile Lake, we saw 6 other paddlers over a 4 night stay. Some tough portages probably deter most. With how much hype there is about killarney I must say I was disappointed.

Sites are large and roomy. Staff was very friendly and helpful Been coming up since I was a little kid. Love it! Always hated my name till I found out I was named after this beautiful park, I adore going up there to this day. I would go back in a heart beat. Do yourself a favour and rent a canoe/kayak and do a portage or two. The rock faces are breath taking. Also, go to the crack! Come early for the non reservable camp sites. The crack trail is a about 4 hours long with beautiful views. I would recommend the chickenising trail which is also close by and shorter with better views. Beautiful provincial park. Beautiful quartzite rounded hills, trails, beautiful canoeing. Good camp sites. You must preserve the water quality because it is rejuvenating from mine pollution atmospheric deposition. The views from the hills are beautiful. Saw a bear that ran away fast. Chikanishing Trail
Great views and amazing lanscapes. Stunning amazing, worth the drive, lots of lakes hiking trails, camping sites both drive in and canoe in only Love this place theres everything and more here Trails swimming and gorgeous Wild life the mosquitoes were heavy this year but got my little gazebo Several trails, hard or easy, good for either family with kids or backpacker.

Over the years we've noticed a steady increase in both campground and backcountry camping (i.e. interior canoeing and hiking). The park and  campground are ... Best hiking trails. Beautiful scenery. Loved my first backcountry camping experience in Killarney. Felt like I was in the middle of a Group of Seven painting. Back country camping, canoeing and sketching with friends was a good time.  The park is slowly repairing from damage caused by the nickel mining and refining in Sudbury which caused so much human suffering.

The recuperation of the land ... Beautiful area.  Good for kayaking and canoing...well worth the drive there. I will visit this place again <3 A great park!

Loved the calm/clean water and clean sites. Silver Peak is worth climbing and give about 4-6 good hrs towards it. Beautiful park
 It was nice and quiet when we went, at the end of August/beginning of September. There were bears throughout the park though but there were no issues. They were simply present, which was honestly neat because we got a great view of some bears! I have been coming to Killarney since before I could walk. It is one of the most incredible little places to go to in Canada, little own Ontario. The Georgian Bay inlet allows for great fishing trips, as well as be surrounded by many ... One of the most beautiful places on earth. Very nice but the rucuns burn the nights. One of the best park. Amazing Trails especially The Crack and active Wildlife. 
Don't miss The Crack (Spectacular View). It is almost Hard but it is worth seeing it. Killarney is a fantastic park with stunning scenery, the camp site at George Lake is set within dense forest and thus plagued by mosquitoes. If you visit during a fire ban this makes for an uncomfortable time. My favourite Ontario provincial park Awesome Provincial park. My family and I drove from Hunstville up to Killarney and this park does not dissapoint. Although we were only here for around 2 hours the views never dissapointed.

It's a life changing experience to be out in the  beautiful natural scenery. I'd totally recommend going. Great time, great weather, great craic and Crack trail! Hey Google it's a provincial park. You have it as a state park. Beautiful park, even better if you can paddle in and get away from crowds. One of the worst Provincial parks we stayed at, at the end of a long crappy road that you must drive back out of when you leave.  Not much to do unless you like mosquitoes!!!! Beautiful. Words aren't enough. Camped here this past weekend and it was absolutely beautiful. Stayed in site #60, privacy wasn't too great but I didn't mind having close neighbors if it meant having more people on bear patrol! Visitor center, comfort stations, and ...

It's a great escape from the business of the big cities. Just a recommendation: you should may be ... Nice launch ramp and parking at the creek.

Great campround and nice views. The canoeing was also really nice, even if it was a bit expensive. Mosquito infested swampy waters. Awesome Provincial Park.

We stayed on George Lake Campground, number 29. Down side is there ... Fantastic Canada Day weekend! A beautiful park with varied terrain and countless rivers to explore. Nice wilderness park.

Can't wait to go here again. Magnificent views from many points. Huge trails did spot few black bears, there is lots to see and explore. The nights are incredible large view of the beautiful night sky its a must see park. Great for couples. Spent my childhood summers here in the late 60s to early 70s.  Wonder if I'd recognize anything if I went back? Too bad I'm not into camping anymore (although I loved it as a kid).  Would there happen to be a Four Season's or a Waldorf Astoria there now I could stay at? It’s worth the drive.
We saw some deer.
The air is fresh.
Beautiful and quiet.
A good break from the world.

The beaches are also very beautiful, perfect sandy beaches for swimming and tanning etc. Fun trails on bedrock outcrops with stunning views. However you do sacrifice privacy here on site as there is almost nothing, if anything between most of them. Great camping sites. Phenomenal beaches. Amazing coastline to be explored on land and on the water. Excellent hiking to grand vistas. It might not be Algonquin but then again Algonquin is not Killbear. I visited her a few times, for day visit. It is lovely. There are beaches and rocky shores for you to choose. My favorite is  the rocky trails. It is much more fun than walking on a flat path. Really good if you're looking for a place to camp Beautiful park. Nice and clean. Great beaches and hiking.  Can't ask for more So many wonderful things to see and do! A great place to relax and get back to nature. 🌲🌲🌲🍁 The windswept trees and beautiful sunsets complete your day to the fullest. We come up every year to this amazing provincial park. Possibly one of the cleanest clearest waters you can swim in in Ontario. The park is full of wildlife and people here at this park are super friendly. 

Park have all the facilities you need like washrooms and showers, it's a great spot! Nice family camping resort overall.  Pros: sandy beach & nice look out trails.  Cons: there's not much privacy between the sites. Comfort stations (bathroom at lighthouse and Harold point need much updating) comfort station at Kilcoursie is the cleanest. Always a great time. No bugs this time of year and we were not on waterfront.  Staff great . Would have given five stars except site was very wet and muddy due to rain.   Going back next year. Another beautiful park on the Georgian Bay. Love camping here! Great lake views, sites are really good size. And if you're lucky you may see some deer and or bears! Beautiful landscape. Amazing sand beach.Look out trail is just awesome!!! They seem to have cut back on staff and it's noticeable. Shorter hours at the visitors centre and not every campground has a station open. The park is still beautiful and we'll definitely come again next year. This has been one of my favorite parks, but after camping across the US, Ontario Parks is really expensive for what you get. The Wardens rarely enforce rules, we had rowdy neighbors, the site had garbage on it when we arrived, and the ... Great experience. Lots of nice trails, Washrooms were impressively clean and kept in good order. Lots of drinking water taps around park. Saw some deer and a Moose calf. 
Lots of very sandy beaches to enjoy.
Good boat launch.
Lots of places to tie off at beaches for boats and seadoo's. I love coming here. Beautiful scenery with clean water. Highly recommend this park. Been coming here for over 20 years. My personal favorite place to camp.  Good for day trip or longer stay.  Cliff jumping at Harold's Point is probably my favorite attraction. Highly recommend. It is a nice park, good for hiking not recommended for family with kids, too many motor boats you can smell diesel in the water at the beach. The Lighthouse point is nice to visit, it is an easy walk in the park not much of a hike. The Bruce peninsula is a much bettter place to visit. This provincial park is nice and well maintained but the sites are quite close together and privacy was a bit of an issue for my liking. I prefer other parks within the area. Beautiful place. Georgian Bay is clean and warm. Most dog unfriendly of the many provincial parks I’ve been to, which is sad because of the number of beaches. Trails in rough shape. Sites are close together and all sand / dirt (no fault of park). Been going for 6 or 7 years now with a bunch of awesome people. 
Great place for adults and kids alike. Sites are close together and on the weekend it seems to be party central. Wardens didnt seem able to get control of the ride drunk who kept us up till 3 am both nights. Only a few trails available but they are stunning. Couple of days camping . Very beautiful park with different views and clean beach . The beach is perfect specially for small children because of shallow clean water. Clean washrooms. Even small one was clean .open fire prohibited due to ... Lovely park. Stayed in the Georgian campground which was radio free. Staff was very helpful, beach was close, breath taking views, but be prepared to share with 50 other people at the same time. Park is very large, so you do have to drive a lot to explore. Great visitor centre. Booked the site a little late so we were close to a path intersection + other campsites. The campsite itself was clean and spacious, big enough for 3 2/3 person tents, 2 cars, and communal dining tent. water was close by and clean and ... One of the best provincial parks around. Scenery and layout is second to none. There's a hiking/biking trail that follows the main drive in. Great way to get some exercise and see wildlife in their natural environment, all at the same ... Amazing place to spend weekends ,canoeing, hiking, biking. Nice campgrounds,great beeches. Friendly personnel. Nice park, though not a lot of trails to hike. Decent campground and facility. Very family friendly. Loved my first experience here, even with a fire ban I had a great camping trip! Was at the lighthouse point camp grounds.  Wonderful place. Has clean showers.  The outhouses (outdoor washrooms) are decent and not that smelly.  They have a 2km length beach but the width is more like 15 meters . Nice trails, there are 3 in total. You can hike all 3 quite quickly. Very nice park, good trails What a great campground. Go prepared, Parry Sound is a half hour away. Spacious, treed lots, great trails (bring bikes) and hot showers. Swimming, fishing, relaxing, campfires.....it was great and we will be going back for sure! Great family camping.  Beaches are nice and lots of them so not to busy! Nice hiking trails for the whole family Truly amazing park and camping site. Amazing water.. and beaches Great campground, really nice beaches, good size sites, and really easy biking path for kids but the park is very well used so animals are nearly tame and not much vegetation between sites for privacy. They have a curfew at 11.30pm campers are not allowed to make noise by this time. Most of our neighbors are all inside their tent sleeping. I only see one shower station in this camping area and washroom is clean but no Shower in the ... A place where you can discharge all of your negative energy and spend a quality time with your loved ones safely. One would be amazed and awed by the sight this park has to offer. Take the trails to go for a hike then go into the crystal ... An amazing spot. Our first time and so beautiful.  Restrooms so clean. Campsites fair price. Great camping and wilderness adventure. You might just see a bear! What a beautiful park , been going here since I was born and will always recommend. This place is beautiful. So quiet, lots of trails to hike, lovely water, large camp sites. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Only issues are- comfort stations (showers) are not in good working order, the shower heads spray all over ... One of the top provincial parks we have.   Facilities are amazing An amazing park, we've been here many times on several campgrounds. Nice bike and hiking trails, beautiful views of Georgian Bay, and spacious sites. The only concern is animals (raccoons and bears  mostly) so don't forget to put away ... Where family memories are made. Some camp areas are better than others though so I recommend a visit before booking a stay. (Sand beaches vs. shield bedrock preferences etc) Great place.  But lots of poison Ivy to watch for.  At least in some areas of the park they put up signs telling you where it is. Took my 2 young boys here for the first time and it was beautiful. The knowledge and educated staff help campers feel safe in bear country. I have been going there multiple times a year for 25 years straight. Highly recommend, fantastic views, great boating, variety of hiking trails, nice visitor center, lovely beaches. Fun with friends or family! This is a great park! Lots of things to do. Great beaches and places to boat, canoe and kayak! Excellent for families. Great beaches, well treed sites, family-appropriate hikes.  We had a great time! Nice place. The kids had so much fun.cant wait to go again Love Killbear!   Especially this year because no mosquitoes. Group campsites are getting updated washrooms. I love this place but they let the dogs all over the beaches and into the water and they never patrol  no matter that there is a beach for dogs and the constant barking - too little supervision and when asked they say they are ... Beautiful park with the most wildlife I've ever seen at a campground. The beach is beautiful, as are the unique rock formations around the Georgian Bay. Great geataway from the everyday It is a beautiful provincial park situated between Barrie and Parry Sound. Beautiful scenery and beaches. Great for families. Kids will love being here. If you want to book a spot for a camper it tends to fill very quickly as it is a very popular park. They also have a modern visitor centre. Friendly staff, clean amenities, nice to see deer so close ro campsites. Lots of trash pandas, but they're well behaved. Only knock was the lack of fittings on the black tank flush hose. Definitely going back. Huge campground! We enjoy bringing our boat here, and fishing throughout the Georgian bay area. We caught mostly pike. There are 3 different hiking trails, that are fairly easy to walk through, and not very long. W also camp with our ... One of the best Parks I've been to in ON. It's located between Parry Sound and Barrie and just the drive alone is amazing. It's located on the outskirts of Georgian Bay so u will be promised some amazing views. There are 3 main trails ... Great place, large area - really beautiful for hiking especially around rocky areas with a great view of the bay and surroundings. Nice beach. Very nice park! We really enjoyed our stay here! Clean beach water. Nice washrooms. Though see should be cleaned more often or just replaced. Great park with very beautiful views. Multiple beaches to play at.

Our first time ...it was really amazing! Killbear Park is very clean, all facilities for camping and the most beautiful experience... we saw deers family! Additional, we recommend to try smoked fish  OMG! Prob one of the best parks but Always busy Best camping experience so far! Beautiful scenery that varies from a rocky landscape to Sandy beaches. there is also an opportunity to go cliff jumping at varying heights at Harold point. bathrooms were cleaned twice a day and there are also showers/ laundry/ canoeing/ kayaking services available. My favorite place on our rv trip through Ontario. We stated on a big site near the water with easy drinking water access. More chipmunks and bluejays than I've seen in one place. One caution is the distance to electric hookups: bring an extension cord Great campsite. Private and quiet park during the off season. Great beaches and clean park. Lots of trails and cliffs to jump off of. Awesome beautiful place very relaxing A bit of a drive, but well worth it...so scenic, so serene...even for just the weekend, camping here helps the city dweller reset...!!! Great campsite, but registration is extremely slow, one guy working hard to register visitors, couple girls are walking around and doing nothing. Get ready to waste a lot of time in the lineup. Some washroom and shower facilities got closed after the hard rain and haven’t opened in a few days. Awesome spot to camp. Kids programs were a nice amenity, lots of different activities for families planned everyday. We brought our kayak and explored local lakes, there were plenty of options nearby.  Also visited several islands from ... Amazing place.  Book early really nice place to go and relax with family and friends, really saw the little bear! Great provincial park in Ontario! Plenty of hiking trails, visitor's center is informative, and still close by to stores in case you forgot something! 2 local park wardens or park patrol one girl one guy both on a power trip out to give tickets, camp site and views were great, just local park enforcement out on a full power trip Love camping here 😊 Some sites are quite small.

A fun place with lots of attractions. Worth to stay for more than week. Nice campground. Some spots quite close together.

Sizeable sites l, lovely beaches and clean facilities. The best place on earth! Great park. Nature at its best Good campsite, no good beaches, you can see deer easily, far away from Barrie Lots of wildlife! Including mosquitoes.  Nice beaches. Well maintained park. Don't expect to be allowed to have fun and relax if you're an adult.

Not a great spot. The park itself is nice, however there are tons of campsites, which means tons of people. This will cause washrooms to break and clean water to run ... Best place of Georgian bay compare to Bruce peninsula national park without shower, killarney is 5-6 hours away. Power out for 2 days, so we cannot take showers.  Gross was not maintained. The worst provincial park for me. It’s a very nice place to spent couple of nights camping here My husband and I decided to take advantage of the beautiful fall weather and hike the trails at Killbear.  We have always heard how beautiful it is.  Our visit started with a talk with Louise in the Park office.  One word can be used to ... Killbear. A great place for camping and summer fun.

Super very nice park!! Awesome camp sites Love this park for camping. Awesome dog friendly beach area that's a quick walk away.

Great beaches. Best camping place in ten years for myself. i hear a lot of good things about this park but i didn't like it for my camping trips. 
the park is so big and nothing is walking distance... every trip to the beach, convenience store, grabbing firewood requires a drive.
park staff are ... Highly recommend. So much to see and some great hiking spots. Camping sites were clean and we'll maintained. Absolutely beautiful! I'd recommend staying in Beaver Damns, great beach and clean. Campsites are large with power, tones of space and lots of friendly people. Camp staff are strict on beach drinking, not allowed. Feel free to do that at your campsite and the quiet time starts at 11pm. Three hours drive from Toronto gets you to this beautiful provincial park. we've spent many longish weekends exploring the park, playing on the beaches, cycling on the park tracks. The visitor center has a great small museum, coffee and shop, plus the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Love Killbear , we visit every year Love it! Perfect for dogs Stayed 2 nights, Nice park.

Recently a friend and I had the opportunity to spend a couple nights at Killbear and I ... Saw a snake pee We began with a self-guided tour without educational aids and found it a nice hike (we saw a doe with twin fawns) but low on educational opportunities. We probably should have started at the store and info centre, but were sent to the ... It must be visited every year at least once The park is an amazing mix of different rocks, clear water, and mixed forests of coniferous and deciduous trees.

It's also a very busy campground so be sure to reserve early.  One of my favourite camping spots, been coming here for 25 years. Be respectful to the staff and they will treat you the same. Follow the rules and you'll have no problems. Book in advance and you'll get a good site. Oh, and the couple ... Great place to visit Great campground. 400+ sites.

Beautiful park Great trails beaches and camping. Cameron is the best. So helpful.  Great park. Clean and safe. Access to electricity for RVs , campers and electronics.  Mid May visit to the park turned out to be a warm and dusty trip. No rain or clouds made the dirt treks dusty.

Overall nice park. Great provincial park good size lots but only electricity at site and typical of many provincial parks a shared pole that can be a fair distance from best RV location ours was over 30 m/100 ft.

Despite the beautiful site we got ,this was ,by far. .the WORST FN camping experience. 
We specifically requested a quiet, private site,and we payed the extra for that .Then we got neighbors from hell.3 small kids Two ignorant parents ... Love this park at has so many structures activities and lots of places to explore or relax.  Great campsites and beautiful scenery. Deer everywhere. Lots of snakes and not the greatest place for kayaking. A wonderful provincial park that offers one of the best quick access points to Lake Huron on this coast. A wonderful trail, great access to water, rocks, forest - and more importantly few people offer a wonderful way to get acquainted ... This classic Ontario Provincial Park does not disappoint. Great spot to really get away from it all and enjoy the great outdoors... with some extra amenities like hot showers and coin-op laundry machines. 😁 Went snowshoeing in December. Parking lot was plowed and washrooms were open. Trail was nice and we saw many deer roaming the woods. Only saw one other small group while we were out.  This is a negative review but in all fairness I am compelled to say...We, Mary and I, were travelling without reservations for Killbear or any knowledge of this park. It was on our driving route and we hoped we could get a site with ... This is our go-to campground for our yearly camping trip. It is always difficult to get a good campground here, especially at Beaver Dams, as it's in a great location, close to the lake. There is a good mix of people there, but I find it ... Amazing park... Great beaches and cycling trail. Fantastic swimming, hiking and camping experience...  love the education center! 😊 Absolutely beautiful I didn't want to leave. Fun place.

Friendly and helpful staff  Cliff jumping was a unique experience which only a few parks in Ontario have this option Fantastic place to be. A perfect place to bring your children for a vacation. Amazing Park -  with excellent kids programming and naturalists that have loads of great information to share. It was a lot of fun and it has nice beachs with some cool jumping rocks. Probably my favorite provincial park to camp/swim/hike in. Amazing sunsets, beautiful woods, beautiful granite rock and the Canadian shield. Lots of mother deer's with baby fawns in late summer, an elusive bear that I have yet to see. ... Nicest park on the water still near South. The campground is well-used, with somewhat closely placed sites that can be awkward to get a camper into. Electrical hookups were oddly placed and took extra cord to connect. But there was a nice bicycle trail alongside the campgrounds ... Great beaches and sites. Can be crowded. Not a lot of hiking trails but they're short and easy. Close to Parry Sound if you need last minute supplies.  Had a great experience hiking, cliff jumping, swimming, hanging out with friends and much more! It was a lot of fun to be at with my friends and I, we had a blast. Beautiful scenery, lots of wildlife (we saw lots of deer and a black bear), good comfort stations. Although the campground was full, it didn't feel crowded.  Accessible for all as long as you obtain the special wheel chair from the visitor center Very good park, beautiful, and nice staff.

But, please be aware of using your credit card at The Detour Store (close to the park entrance) as deposit to rental boat, they may charge your card without your permission with a small amount, ...

Fabulous views, great swimming and good camp sites.  Wonderful scenery, well kept facilities, opportunity for wildlife sightings. Beautiful place to go camping, the water really clean. Best park close to GTA which I wish every summer Wonderful park but a bit cold water.  The park is absolutely beautiful.  The facilities are awesome and the staff working there are really good too! My site was at blind bay and there was so much privacy and space.  I just recommend looking up the site pictures before ... Awesome camping and hiking destination. Will be returning asap!  The weather was great all week. Compared to our last few camping trips it was a nice change. The trails where easy to hike around and lots to look at.  I didn't fully explore this place, but it was a nice pitstop for us when going further up north. Entrance is free. beautiful place  during the fall season scenery were spectacular just like the once from the group of 7 painting. awesome site
makes you feel and enjoys Gods great creation. Beautiful Absolutely beautiful! Can't wait to camp here again!!!

Would highly recommend to others :) Spectacular Provincial Park Been here 2 years in a row. Love this place. great trails, lot of beautiful views, there are a lot of deers, bears and wildlife so be careful with your food abd garbages Love it. We go every year. Great park with good sized sites in general. Great set up for camping and great views Its Beautiful Amazing place to come and see deers and camp.. :) This was always my favourite provincial park growing up as a kid. There is lots of amenities and over 6 beaches and plenty of campgrounds. Definitely reccomended! Just watch for the snakes as I saw a watersnake at the public beach. We come each July 1 weekend. Love it! This year was my first visit.  Lots of wildlife to see.  I saw many deer and a snake almost got my wife (angry water snake).  There are many trails and beaches to keep things interesting.  I will definitely return. Breathtaking!!! Great beach and great dog run area! Beautiful trails and a lot of deers 😊 Beautiful, one of the best parks in Southern Ontario Very hard to get into The best provincial park I've ever been to. Varied campsites, beautiful beaches and rocky shores to explore, and lots of great events going on for kids. Quiet and beautiful. A must visit Provincial Park.  Love coming to this park every year I'm more of a backcountry backpack camper but this was a nice change and relaxing. Park officials are a bit extreme with noise as we were merely speaking at a quiet volume just as the sun was going down and we were almost fined - ... Deer, deer, deer...and great campsites, too.  We visit more than 10 Provincial Parks every year and this is still one of my favorites.  Harold  Point Campground is good in the summer if you want something a little quieter and there are sites for larger 5th wheels. Short walk to the ... Nice place but the rangers can be overzealous about some things My favourite campground Nice park with great views.  One of my favorite places on Earth.  Great park, fantastic beaches and shorelines Beautiful park, make sure to hike the lookout trail to get to the edge of Georgian Bay This is the best provincial park I have been to. Beautiful sunsets This is a great park. I recommend staying in blind bay. It is quiet and shady Killbear is beautiful with a fabulous beach and it's close to home!  The expanses of weathered rock are beautiful and calming.

They are also the location used for the ""I Lost My Talk"" film portion of John Estacio's music based on Rita Joe's poem. 

I recommend experiencing both. Park management doesn't seem to have a clue what's going on in the park. Peaceful, energizing and full of adventures.  Amazing beaches and a great overall experience.   One of the best and our favorite! A Little crowded park because of all the campsites. The view from the Lookout Point is really beautiful. The tree where everyone is talking about is not really worth it. The Trail to the lighthouse is also a Nice walk. A lot of beaches. ... In the 7 days we were there, we saw deer behind our site every day but two. A warning through , there are a lot of snakes. We took our 11 AND 9 and stayed in a small pop up trailer. Had an extra tent for a food/dining tent. The lot was absolutely humongous! the beach felt like you were at the ocean. The bathrooms and showers were nice and big and were kept meticulously clean!!!!! Absolutely would recommend this camping ground.  Wonderful campsite for family camping  Best Park for camping (so far) Lots of great waterfront sites. Very large with amazing beach. Very large park. Would suggest starting for 4-5 days to experience all of the park. gave our very first camping here. some campsites may have big puddle after heavy rains.  Fantastic scenery, great biking and hiking trails. Amazing sunsets at Lighthouse Point.

We just wished there were canoe rentals and delivery in park like Algonquin.  This is one of my favorite places on the planet. A piece of my heart will always be with Killbear. Hoping to get my daughter there soon! Have always loved camping here. Great scenery. Lots of stuff to do. Unique combination of beaches, Georgian Bay shoreline and wildlife. There's camping, hiking trails, and a modern visitor centre and ""edutaining"" interpretive programs.  Best park in Ontario Very cozy and nice people So pretty!  The water feels great on a hot day, and it's really fun to climb around on the rocks! Have been camping here my hole life, love the sunsets from the rocks. Best car camping in Ontario  We stayed 2 nights but no bears and rattle snakes! Beautiful exceptional nature, given that everything else around is private.  a must visit,  otherwise, the most degenerate park.  blackouts, firebans even after rain, rangers chasing bear with a flash light together with campers.   super nosy ... Nice view. One of the best parks in Ontario  Excellent place for camping. Dog exercise is not dog beach. Not a very nice trail to walk.  Amazing Amazing This is a great park. Has a nice dog beach. Very nice experience. First time here and it was enjoyable.  Finest place there is to chill out beautiful scenery a great place for a vacation  Name is misleading because they bears aren't that deadly (I'm still alive bears! Hahahah!) but the sites are beautiful, and the water is crystal clear. Book your site six months in advance because it fills up! It has amazing views  Nice beaches. Lots of bears so do your research, bear spray, keeping your site clean etc. absolutely amazing I have not camped here but it seems very crowded. 

It seems like everywhere you go, you are bound to run in to people. The park is a bit crowded, overall, nice place to go in the fall. Great scenic place Awsome place. Went camping in October. Awesome time, trees are perfect colour, nice for pictures. Sick place, rude neighbors, Remeber to get a free bear bin for your stay! One of my faourite camping grounds to go too, beautiful site seeing go here every year. Great park! Been coming for years tons to do from secluded beaches in Blind Bay to cliff jumping at Harolds Point. Recommended for all ages! Beautiful park. Highly recommended Best place ever. Discovered it last year and third time here since then. Was a perfect weekend Great place to visit. Awe-inspiring Amazing camping... Great for the family.  Great place in the fall We used to go to this ""campground"" every year for its wildlife and beaches. Key word there is used to. I just got back about a week ago and the only thing i can say is that this place makes you feel like a prisoner if you are a group of ... Hello
One of the 10 Best place for camping and swimming

Clean washrooms great campsite and awesome beaches One of the greatest places to go camping or even to go up for a day or so! The waters are beautiful, not very cold even when it is chilly in the air. The rocks are full of  minerals that seem to seep into the waters and therefore are ... Was better when less HUMUGOUS vehicles were in the park, and the tree canopy  has suffered greatly.  Find it very hard to reserve exactly what we want now that the Park is so popular The best Provincial Park I know. And yes, there are bears. Loved it, water was nice and warm, nice shady spots on the beach.  Lots of wildlife. HORRIBLE PLACE FOR GROUPS! You will get kicked out even if your in a radio-safe zone! 
They say they welcome groups, but this is false. If you make the slightest noise you'll get kicked out. 

You pay for an experience at the risk of getting kicked out. 
I am never returning there ever again.  Went there every year in my childhood, im not sure how the park is today but if it hasnt changed too much i would always reccomend it. Created the best summers any kid could ask for. My all time favorite park. 
It's large, but not overwhelming. 
Sites are big, nicely separated, many wih hydro, and easily accommodating 2 or 3 tents. 
Most park's amenities are newer,  and very clean. 
Museum is nice and pancake ... Beautiful Just went cross country skiing on boxing day. Nice trail. Lots of animal tracks.  Gorgeous campground especially for fall camping! Great park. They actually have bears. No water for long weekends!!!!!! Had Great time camping here. I have been going since i was born and it so nice there. If u r reading this book now! Great place to see, really nice views. Little too crowdy tho. A great place to camp and forget about the world Great  back and swimming  Excellent park, fairly close to town, great hiking Love it there, go every year for a week! I camped here three times and it's always an adventure. There was cliff jumping, which was nerve-racking at first. The only thing that I wish this place had is canoe/kayak rental in the campground. My friends and I had to go out of the ... Great place to go camping in a group  First time here,  we arrived in Sept 6th just for a night,  the 24 hrs felt like a week. There was so much to see and do,  the staff was so friendly and informative. I loved the fact that they recognise people with disabilities, and gave ... One of the most beautiful parks I've ever camped in. I would have given it higher marks, except for a few quirks. The main camp office is closed on Sat/Sun, which seems strange. The Kilcoursie camp office was closed when it was supposed ... Nice clean water, pretty view.  One of the most outstanding places to camp! Great location Nice place...good/clean beaches  My favourite provincial park. Beautiful park. A shame we didn't get to explore more. Beautiful and very peaceful Enjoyed it. WI'll come again probably.
PS. I really enjoyed Philly's cheese steak, pit stop at Philthy Philly's in Newmarket. Davis and yonge st. Mmmmmmmmmm Philthy Philly's coming soon in pickering and in Whitby. Nice trails. Good for groups.  Beaches were really nice but we went to the public beach and very very weedy when swimming from about chest level out (gross).  At Blind Bay beach was fine for weeds but bottom was muck and rocky in spots.  Nice views though.  Lighthouse ... Awesome Park. Great park  Amazing! Great sites and close to the beach  no bear patrol Great place for camping. Mother nature at her best! Beautiful!

Georgian Bay sunsetsKillbear is an amazing place to go camping. There are tons of bike and hiking trails. The lakes and many beaches are beautiful and clean. They have unsupervised cliff jumping for the brave ones in your group. Those who love riding trials ... Can't wait to go here again. Magnificent views from many points. Huge trails did spot few black bears, there is lots to see and explore. The nights are incredible large view of the beautiful night sky its a must see park. Great for couples. Spent my childhood summers here in the late 60s to early 70s.  Wonder if I'd recognize anything if I went back? Too bad I'm not into camping anymore (although I loved it as a kid).  Would there happen to be a Four Season's or a Waldorf Astoria there now I could stay at? It’s worth the drive.
We saw some deer.
The air is fresh.
Beautiful and quiet.
A good break from the world.
Meditation is key. Beautiful park, well maintained, lots to explore for all ages. Areas for swimming, kayaking, hiking, motor boating and of course relaxing. I recommend you bring bicycles as the park is very big. Park staff are well informed at the ... Best park to comfortably go car camping in. Lots to see, lots of trails and beautiful beaches. Very clean facilities too. Wide range of campsites, some more private than others. My family enjoys camping at Harold Point best. We will return for years to come. Got to explore this place more next year. Beautiful and full of interesting stuff to do. Sign in process was super annoying though, especially after a 3 hour drive. This is probably my favourite provincial park after Algonquin. The park has been left to nature - its not all perfectly laid out and landscaped like some places. We have a great site (96) but next year might try to snag one of the ... I am in love with Killbear, I can't say enough about how amazing this park is. Its big and beautiful. The beach is amazing, clean and I loved the water. I meet lots of people here, one couple who comes from Germany every year just to ... Killbear was our first camping experience and really wonderful. 3  nights and a whole lot of peaceful and amazing moments. A great way to disconnect from the city; the noisy roads and pollution. Sleeping in a tent at night was somewhat ... This park has some amazing sunsets. The beaches are also very beautiful, perfect sandy beaches for swimming and tanning etc. Fun trails on bedrock outcrops with stunning views. However you do sacrifice privacy here on site as there is almost nothing, if anything between most of them. Great camping sites. Phenomenal beaches. Amazing coastline to be explored on land and on the water. Excellent hiking to grand vistas. It might not be Algonquin but then again Algonquin is not Killbear. I visited her a few times, for day visit. It is lovely. There are beaches and rocky shores for you to choose. My favorite is  the rocky trails. It is much more fun than walking on a flat path. Really good if you're looking for a place to camp Beautiful park. Nice and clean. Great beaches and hiking.  Can't ask for more So many wonderful things to see and do! A great place to relax and get back to nature. 🌲🌲🌲🍁 The windswept trees and beautiful sunsets complete your day to the fullest. We come up every year to this amazing provincial park. Possibly one of the cleanest clearest waters you can swim in in Ontario. The park is full of wildlife and people here at this park are super friendly. 

Park have all the facilities you need like washrooms and showers, it's a great spot! Nice family camping resort overall.  Pros: sandy beach & nice look out trails.  Cons: there's not much privacy between the sites. Comfort stations (bathroom at lighthouse and Harold point need much updating) comfort station at Kilcoursie is the cleanest. Always a great time. No bugs this time of year and we were not on waterfront.  Staff great . Would have given five stars except site was very wet and muddy due to rain.   Going back next year. Another beautiful park on the Georgian Bay. Love camping here! Great lake views, sites are really good size. And if you're lucky you may see some deer and or bears! Beautiful landscape. Amazing sand beach.Look out trail is just awesome!!! They seem to have cut back on staff and it's noticeable. Shorter hours at the visitors centre and not every campground has a station open. The park is still beautiful and we'll definitely come again next year. This has been one of my favorite parks, but after camping across the US, Ontario Parks is really expensive for what you get. The Wardens rarely enforce rules, we had rowdy neighbors, the site had garbage on it when we arrived, and the ... Great experience. Lots of nice trails, Washrooms were impressively clean and kept in good order. Lots of drinking water taps around park. Saw some deer and a Moose calf. 
Lots of very sandy beaches to enjoy.
Good boat launch.
Lots of places to tie off at beaches for boats and seadoo's. I love coming here. Beautiful scenery with clean water. Highly recommend this park. Been coming here for over 20 years. My personal favorite place to camp.  Good for day trip or longer stay.  Cliff jumping at Harold's Point is probably my favorite attraction. Highly recommend. It is a nice park, good for hiking not recommended for family with kids, too many motor boats you can smell diesel in the water at the beach. The Lighthouse point is nice to visit, it is an easy walk in the park not much of a hike. The Bruce peninsula is a much bettter place to visit. This provincial park is nice and well maintained but the sites are quite close together and privacy was a bit of an issue for my liking. I prefer other parks within the area. Beautiful place. Georgian Bay is clean and warm. Most dog unfriendly of the many provincial parks I’ve been to, which is sad because of the number of beaches. Trails in rough shape. Sites are close together and all sand / dirt (no fault of park). Been going for 6 or 7 years now with a bunch of awesome people. 
Great place for adults and kids alike. Sites are close together and on the weekend it seems to be party central. Wardens didnt seem able to get control of the ride drunk who kept us up till 3 am both nights. Only a few trails available but they are stunning. Couple of days camping . Very beautiful park with different views and clean beach . The beach is perfect specially for small children because of shallow clean water. Clean washrooms. Even small one was clean .open fire prohibited due to ... Lovely park. Stayed in the Georgian campground which was radio free. Staff was very helpful, beach was close, breath taking views, but be prepared to share with 50 other people at the same time. Park is very large, so you do have to drive a lot to explore. Great visitor centre. Booked the site a little late so we were close to a path intersection + other campsites. The campsite itself was clean and spacious, big enough for 3 2/3 person tents, 2 cars, and communal dining tent. water was close by and clean and ... One of the best provincial parks around. Scenery and layout is second to none. There's a hiking/biking trail that follows the main drive in. Great way to get some exercise and see wildlife in their natural environment, all at the same ... Amazing place to spend weekends ,canoeing, hiking, biking. Nice campgrounds,great beeches. Friendly personnel. Nice park, though not a lot of trails to hike. Decent campground and facility. Very family friendly. Loved my first experience here, even with a fire ban I had a great camping trip! Was at the lighthouse point camp grounds.  Wonderful place. Has clean showers.  The outhouses (outdoor washrooms) are decent and not that smelly.  They have a 2km length beach but the width is more like 15 meters . Nice trails, there are 3 in total. You can hike all 3 quite quickly. Very nice park, good trails What a great campground. Go prepared, Parry Sound is a half hour away. Spacious, treed lots, great trails (bring bikes) and hot showers. Swimming, fishing, relaxing, campfires.....it was great and we will be going back for sure! Great family camping.  Beaches are nice and lots of them so not to busy! Nice hiking trails for the whole family Truly amazing park and camping site. Amazing water.. and beaches Great campground, really nice beaches, good size sites, and really easy biking path for kids but the park is very well used so animals are nearly tame and not much vegetation between sites for privacy. They have a curfew at 11.30pm campers are not allowed to make noise by this time. Most of our neighbors are all inside their tent sleeping. I only see one shower station in this camping area and washroom is clean but no Shower in the ... A place where you can discharge all of your negative energy and spend a quality time with your loved ones safely. One would be amazed and awed by the sight this park has to offer. Take the trails to go for a hike then go into the crystal ... An amazing spot. Our first time and so beautiful.  Restrooms so clean. Campsites fair price. Great camping and wilderness adventure. You might just see a bear! What a beautiful park , been going here since I was born and will always recommend. This place is beautiful. So quiet, lots of trails to hike, lovely water, large camp sites. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Only issues are- comfort stations (showers) are not in good working order, the shower heads spray all over ... One of the top provincial parks we have.   Facilities are amazing An amazing park, we've been here many times on several campgrounds. Nice bike and hiking trails, beautiful views of Georgian Bay, and spacious sites. The only concern is animals (raccoons and bears  mostly) so don't forget to put away ... Where family memories are made. Some camp areas are better than others though so I recommend a visit before booking a stay. (Sand beaches vs. shield bedrock preferences etc) Great place.  But lots of poison Ivy to watch for.  At least in some areas of the park they put up signs telling you where it is. Took my 2 young boys here for the first time and it was beautiful. The knowledge and educated staff help campers feel safe in bear country. I have been going there multiple times a year for 25 years straight. Highly recommend, fantastic views, great boating, variety of hiking trails, nice visitor center, lovely beaches. Fun with friends or family! This is a great park! Lots of things to do. Great beaches and places to boat, canoe and kayak! Excellent for families. Great beaches, well treed sites, family-appropriate hikes.  We had a great time! Nice place. The kids had so much fun.cant wait to go again Love Killbear!   Especially this year because no mosquitoes. Group campsites are getting updated washrooms. I love this place but they let the dogs all over the beaches and into the water and they never patrol  no matter that there is a beach for dogs and the constant barking - too little supervision and when asked they say they are ... Beautiful park with the most wildlife I've ever seen at a campground. The beach is beautiful, as are the unique rock formations around the Georgian Bay. Great geataway from the everyday It is a beautiful provincial park situated between Barrie and Parry Sound. Beautiful scenery and beaches. Great for families. Kids will love being here. If you want to book a spot for a camper it tends to fill very quickly as it is a very popular park. They also have a modern visitor centre. Friendly staff, clean amenities, nice to see deer so close ro campsites. Lots of trash pandas, but they're well behaved. Only knock was the lack of fittings on the black tank flush hose. Definitely going back. Huge campground! We enjoy bringing our boat here, and fishing throughout the Georgian bay area. We caught mostly pike. There are 3 different hiking trails, that are fairly easy to walk through, and not very long. W also camp with our ... One of the best Parks I've been to in ON. It's located between Parry Sound and Barrie and just the drive alone is amazing. It's located on the outskirts of Georgian Bay so u will be promised some amazing views. There are 3 main trails ... Great place, large area - really beautiful for hiking especially around rocky areas with a great view of the bay and surroundings. Nice beach. Very nice park! We really enjoyed our stay here! Clean beach water. Nice washrooms. Though see should be cleaned more often or just replaced. Great park with very beautiful views. Multiple beaches to play at. Lots of rocky climbs and walks to explore. Great provincial park, lots of sites, walking trails were incredible, the beach was nice. Our kids had lots of little creeks and things to explore. Our first time ...it was really amazing! Killbear Park is very clean, all facilities for camping and the most beautiful experience... we saw deers family! Additional, we recommend to try smoked fish  OMG! Prob one of the best parks but Always busy Best camping experience so far! Beautiful scenery that varies from a rocky landscape to Sandy beaches. there is also an opportunity to go cliff jumping at varying heights at Harold point. bathrooms were cleaned twice a day and there are also showers/ laundry/ canoeing/ kayaking services available. My favorite place on our rv trip through Ontario. We stated on a big site near the water with easy drinking water access. More chipmunks and bluejays than I've seen in one place. One caution is the distance to electric hookups: bring an extension cord Great campsite. Private and quiet park during the off season. Great beaches and clean park. Lots of trails and cliffs to jump off of. Awesome beautiful place very relaxing A bit of a drive, but well worth it...so scenic, so serene...even for just the weekend, camping here helps the city dweller reset...!!! Great campsite, but registration is extremely slow, one guy working hard to register visitors, couple girls are walking around and doing nothing. Get ready to waste a lot of time in the lineup. Some washroom and shower facilities got closed after the hard rain and haven’t opened in a few days. Awesome spot to camp. Kids programs were a nice amenity, lots of different activities for families planned everyday. We brought our kayak and explored local lakes, there were plenty of options nearby.  Also visited several islands from ... Amazing place.  Book early really nice place to go and relax with family and friends, really saw the little bear! Great provincial park in Ontario! Plenty of hiking trails, visitor's center is informative, and still close by to stores in case you forgot something! 2 local park wardens or park patrol one girl one guy both on a power trip out to give tickets, camp site and views were great, just local park enforcement out on a full power trip Love camping here 😊 Some sites are quite small.  Beach is beautiful Been coming here since I was 2 years old. Absolutely gorgeous park. Beautiful park, wonderful landscapes and a great place to visit. Staff are very knowledgable and awesome. A fun place with lots of attractions. Worth to stay for more than week. Nice campground. Some spots quite close together. I was disappointed to see no one properly cleaning up a site after the last group had left 2 days prior. There was litter everywhere. The women's toliet clogged and was not fixed for ... Nice sites and great showers, washroom and beach. The Visitor's Center was an unexpected treat. The hands-on approach and the child friendly activities (which this adult enjoyed as well) made my visit quite enjoyable. Beautiful beaches, spectacular hiking trails breathtaking scenery. Rangers and staff super cool. My favorite spot in Ontario by far! We had such a fun time camping at Killbear! The staff is wonderful, the facilities are modern and clean, and the grounds well kept. We were there on Thanksgiving weekend. The weather beautiful! There is lots to do. We went on a really ... Pretty good park for camping over Canada day long weekend. The Beach was amazing.

Sizeable sites l, lovely beaches and clean facilities. The best place on earth! Great park. Nature at its best Good campsite, no good beaches, you can see deer easily, far away from Barrie Lots of wildlife! Including mosquitoes.  Nice beaches. Well maintained park. Don't expect to be allowed to have fun and relax if you're an adult.

Not a great spot. The park itself is nice, however there are tons of campsites, which means tons of people. This will cause washrooms to break and clean water to run ... Best place of Georgian bay compare to Bruce peninsula national park without shower, killarney is 5-6 hours away. Power out for 2 days, so we cannot take showers.  Gross was not maintained. The worst provincial park for me. It’s a very nice place to spent couple of nights camping here My husband and I decided to take advantage of the beautiful fall weather and hike the trails at Killbear.  We have always heard how beautiful it is.  Our visit started with a talk with Louise in the Park office.  One word can be used to ... Killbear. A great place for camping and summer fun.  We go every year for family vacation. Lots of activities for the kids - beaches, visitor centre for learning about the area and the local animals, trails to walk on and view Georgian ... One of our favourite provincial parks. Good variety of sites, great for biking or hiking, beautiful location on Georgian Bay.

Great place, facilities are clean, staff are great. No ammenaties in the park so be prepared to buy ice and rent items from the store outside the park. Wonderful beaches and rocky hills by the water. Nice views over Georgia  bay. Great except for a fire ban but can't blame the park for that. Great park, nice staff, beautiful sunsets, lots of wildlife! Amazing views and scenery! Also bring bikes and helmets, awesome trails. Bugs aren't bad as well ( depends ). Camper and tent lots are perfect as well and always kept clean.

Amazing Park, the only one that comes close is Bon Echo. I love this park, the hikes are amazing, staff is kind and helpful and we had a wonderful time for the long weekend!

Super very nice park!! Awesome camp sites Love this park for camping. Awesome dog friendly beach area that's a quick walk away. We like to stay at Lighthouse when we go - the sites are generally pretty private with a reasonable distance and decent amount of foliage between sites. Bathrooms and outhouses are well maintained and kept clean. Awesome, beautiful, well managed. Great memories for kids and family.  Hike this park and see for yourself. Beautiful Ontario park.  Great beaches. Best camping place in ten years for myself. i hear a lot of good things about this park but i didn't like it for my camping trips. 
the park is so big and nothing is walking distance... every trip to the beach, convenience store, grabbing firewood requires a drive.
park staff are ... Highly recommend. So much to see and some great hiking spots. Camping sites were clean and we'll maintained. Absolutely beautiful! I'd recommend staying in Beaver Damns, great beach and clean. Campsites are large with power, tones of space and lots of friendly people. Camp staff are strict on beach drinking, not allowed. Feel free to do that at your campsite and the quiet time starts at 11pm. Three hours drive from Toronto gets you to this beautiful provincial park. we've spent many longish weekends exploring the park, playing on the beaches, cycling on the park tracks. The visitor center has a great small museum, coffee and shop, plus the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Love Killbear , we visit every year Love it! Perfect for dogs Stayed 2 nights, Nice park. Not busy at all in October. Would like to come again. No issues with wildlife. Unluckily also no fall colours when we got there. The hike from Granite Saddle to Harold's point along the beach is fun Absolutely stunning park! Harold point and Beaver Dams are great areas to camp. Love this campground. So many family memories. Went on a guided kayaking tour. BEAUTIFUL! Pleasant,  but the day use beach is pretty sad for 14 dollars. Beautiful cleann and clear lake We absolutely love this park! We had a great time at this provincial park.  The beach is beautiful. There are lots of hiking trails and unique campsites.  This park is quite expansive, bikes would be really handy. Each section has a comfort station and all outhouses have flush toilets, sinks and soap. My favorite place to hang out in the summer. Great trails, amazing water. You can literally jump in the water everywhere you go on a hot day. I have been going there for 25+ years and it is somewhere I will always return to on a yearly basis. Love camping here. Amazing place to camp. Love Georgian Bay, full of fun and exciting things to do and see Great place for camping. If you have a large group this park is not for you.

I was at Killbear for a one-night stay when I was a teenager and I remember not thinking too much of the park at that time. Recently a friend and I had the opportunity to spend a couple nights at Killbear and I ... Saw a snake pee We began with a self-guided tour without educational aids and found it a nice hike (we saw a doe with twin fawns) but low on educational opportunities. We probably should have started at the store and info centre, but were sent to the ... It must be visited every year at least once The park is an amazing mix of different rocks, clear water, and mixed forests of coniferous and deciduous trees.  The sunsets are breath taking and end each day perfectly.  This park has been our home away from home for over 25 years. Come on over and you will probably see a deer or 2 right in your camp site.  Great place to swim! Really great car camping. Great beach and nice sites, some right on the water. Only downside is no camp store but there is am outfitter and general store nearby. It's also a very busy campground so be sure to reserve early.  One of my favourite camping spots, been coming here for 25 years. Be respectful to the staff and they will treat you the same. Follow the rules and you'll have no problems. Book in advance and you'll get a good site. Oh, and the couple ... Great place to visit Great campground. 400+ sites.
Many beaches on Georgian bay.

Lots of deer and chipmunks. Great little beaches, and rocky bluffs to climb. The best provincial park I have been to yet. Beautiful park and well maintained.
 Lots of activities for young and old alike.
Friendly staff.
Like most Provincial parks, it does not offer ice. Ice would be a huge revenue stream for parks. 
Thank you. Beautiful park Perfect for camping, fishing ... Couldn't say enough good things!!! Washroom were kept clean. A piece of heaven. A must visit when in the Parry Sound area. Sites are very large. Plenty of space to accommodate families of 4 or more. Lots of trees. The beach was wonderful even for a fall day. Fantastic park! One of Ontario's best parks.

Purchased a day use permit and spent the day kayaking along the shoreline. Picnicked on the rocks and swam in the refreshing Georgian Bay water.  One of my all time favourites. Great beach! We love the love rock Great park for families. The park has a lot of facilities. They sell firewood and kindlewood too so don't need to bring it along. Highly recommended! Nice quiet beautiful place. If you want to paddle and hike it's a great spot. Family and dog frendly. Not a party place if that is your thing it's not the best spot for that.

Some of the best camping in Ontario. Quieter after labour day Very interesting and a lovely place. The best park i ever visited in Ontario. it was worth a 3 hrs drive.

You're guaranteed private time on beaches as there are ... Amazing wildlife  . But the water doesn't compare to Bruce peninsula. Still great though Average quality park. We camped for 4 nights at Lighthouse Point, and as we arrived we requested to switch campsite location because the rainy days prior to us arriving had created massive puddles and swamp like areas bringing tons of ... My favourite campground ever! Love the wonderful sites just a walk away from the great beaches of Georgian Bay. Amazing Perfect camping Loved this spot! Wonderful scenery, great campsites and decent facilities. Definitely will be returning  Love this park!! Reserve extra early if you are booking in prime camping season as it can be difficult to get a site. Fall camping is now open from thanksgiving until the end of October.

Love the rec trail, visitor centre, and of course the water for a good paddle.  Beautiful park for Canada.  We love Land Between The Lakes in Kentucky best.

Beautiful park Great trails beaches and camping. Cameron is the best. So helpful.  Great park. Clean and safe. Access to electricity for RVs , campers and electronics.  Mid May visit to the park turned out to be a warm and dusty trip. No rain or clouds made the dirt treks dusty. We did a couple of hikes that would be much nicer in a months time as the trees will get some green. Rock formations in the park are really good and provided nice views of the Georgian Bay. Overall nice park. Great provincial park good size lots but only electricity at site and typical of many provincial parks a shared pole that can be a fair distance from best RV location ours was over 30 m/100 ft. Washrooms and showers were clean. Killbear is a phenomenal park. The beaches are beautiful, and we have seen deer here many times.

We specifically requested a quiet, private site,and we payed the extra for that .Then we got neighbors from hell.3 small kids Two ignorant parents ... Love this park at has so many structures activities and lots of places to explore or relax.  Great campsites and beautiful scenery. Deer everywhere. Lots of snakes and not the greatest place for kayaking. A wonderful provincial park that offers one of the best quick access points to Lake Huron on this coast. A wonderful trail, great access to water, rocks, forest - and more importantly few people offer a wonderful way to get acquainted ... This classic Ontario Provincial Park does not disappoint. Great spot to really get away from it all and enjoy the great outdoors... with some extra amenities like hot showers and coin-op laundry machines. 😁 Went snowshoeing in December. Parking lot was plowed and washrooms were open. Trail was nice and we saw many deer roaming the woods. Only saw one other small group while we were out.  This is a negative review but in all fairness I am compelled to say...We, Mary and I, were travelling without reservations for Killbear or any knowledge of this park. It was on our driving route and we hoped we could get a site with ... This is our go-to campground for our yearly camping trip.

Probably my favorite provincial park to camp/swim/hike in. Amazing sunsets, beautiful woods, beautiful granite rock and the Canadian shield. Lots of mother deer's with baby fawns in late summer, an elusive bear that I have yet to see. ... Nicest park on the water still near South. The campground is well-used, with somewhat closely placed sites that can be awkward to get a camper into. Electrical hookups were oddly placed and took extra cord to connect. But there was a nice bicycle trail alongside the campgrounds ... Great beaches and sites. Can be crowded. Not a lot of hiking trails but they're short and easy. Close to Parry Sound if you need last minute supplies.  Had a great experience hiking, cliff jumping, swimming, hanging out with friends and much more!

The expanses of weathered rock are beautiful and calming.

They are also the location used for the ""I Lost My Talk"" film portion of John Estacio's music based on Rita Joe's poem. 

I recommend experiencing both. Park management doesn't seem to have a clue what's going on in the park. Peaceful, energizing and full of adventures.  Amazing beaches and a great overall experience.   One of the best and our favorite! A Little crowded park because of all the campsites. The view from the Lookout Point is really beautiful. The tree where everyone is talking about is not really worth it. The Trail to the lighthouse is also a Nice walk. A lot of beaches. ... In the 7 days we were there, we saw deer behind our site every day but two. A warning through , there are a lot of snakes. We took our 11 AND 9 and stayed in a small pop up trailer.

The bathrooms and showers were nice and big and were kept meticulously clean!!!!! Absolutely would recommend this camping ground.  Wonderful campsite for family camping  Best Park for camping (so far) Lots of great waterfront sites. Very large with amazing beach. Very large park.

The waters are beautiful, not very cold even when it is chilly in the air. The rocks are full of  minerals that seem to seep into the waters and therefore are ... Was better when less HUMUGOUS vehicles were in the park, and the tree canopy  has suffered greatly.  Find it very hard to reserve exactly what we want now that the Park is so popular The best Provincial Park I know. And yes, there are bears. Loved it, water was nice and warm, nice shady spots on the beach.  Lots of wildlife. HORRIBLE PLACE FOR GROUPS! You will get kicked out even if your in a radio-safe zone! 
They say they welcome groups, but this is false. If you make the slightest noise you'll get kicked out. 

You pay for an experience at the risk of getting kicked out. 
I am never returning there ever again.  Went there every year in my childhood, im not sure how the park is today but if it hasnt changed too much i would always reccomend it. Created the best summers any kid could ask for. My all time favorite park. 
It's large, but not overwhelming. 
Sites are big, nicely separated, many wih hydro, and easily accommodating 2 or 3 tents. 
Most park's amenities are newer,  and very clean. 
Museum is nice and pancake ... Beautiful Just went cross country skiing on boxing day. Nice trail. Lots of animal tracks.  Gorgeous campground especially for fall camping! Great park. They actually have bears. No water for long weekends!!!!!! Had Great time camping here. I have been going since i was born and it so nice there. If u r reading this book now! Great place to see, really nice views. Little too crowdy tho. A great place to camp and forget about the world Great  back and swimming  Excellent park, fairly close to town, great hiking Love it there, go every year for a week! I camped here three times and it's always an adventure. There was cliff jumping, which was nerve-racking at first. The only thing that I wish this place had is canoe/kayak rental in the campground. My friends and I had to go out of the ... Great place to go camping in a group  First time here,  we arrived in Sept 6th just for a night,  the 24 hrs felt like a week. There was so much to see and do,  the staff was so friendly and informative. I loved the fact that they recognise people with disabilities, and gave ... One of the most beautiful parks I've ever camped in. I would have given it higher marks, except for a few quirks. The main camp office is closed on Sat/Sun, which seems strange. The Kilcoursie camp office was closed when it was supposed ... Nice clean water, pretty view.  One of the most outstanding places to camp! Great location Nice place...good/clean beaches  My favourite provincial park. Beautiful park. A shame we didn't get to explore more. Beautiful and very peaceful Enjoyed it. WI'll come again probably.
PS. I really enjoyed Philly's cheese steak, pit stop at Philthy Philly's in Newmarket. Davis and yonge st. Mmmmmmmmmm Philthy Philly's coming soon in pickering and in Whitby. Nice trails. Good for groups.  Beaches were really nice but we went to the public beach and very very weedy when swimming from about chest level out (gross).  At Blind Bay beach was fine for weeds but bottom was muck and rocky in spots.  Nice views though.  Lighthouse ... Awesome Park. Great park  Amazing! Great sites and close to the beach  no bear patrol Great place for camping. Mother nature at her best! Beautiful! Beautiful park great for camping You can kick out someone by just telling Park Warden they are noisy. Park warden visit you a lot. Amazing place  Nice for camping.  Beautiful scenery Great place to paddle Been going here since I was 5 or 6 and never stopped coming back. Nice park! The standard by which other parks should be measured.

The park is very well maintained, unfortunately people still leave garbage about. The trail head does have ... Great place to take a hike and clear your head.  The trails are will maintained and clean.  The variety of terrain as well as the different trail skill levels make it so you want to hike more and more! We love hiking here. Parking is now paid, which is $5.25 for 2 hours, as a minimum, however, the trails are great, and scenic. Great place for a family walk or a date, and just minutes from the city Great place for a hike. I like the different terrain the trails take. Flat and open, up hill, down hill, rocky , roots sticking out, canopy, big trees, river.
Quite and pristine. This is definitely worth a visit, if you like hiking and ... Even on a cold fall day this provincial park is magical. Set along the Thames River, there are beautiful look outs, wildlife, and a multitude of paths. 

Only downside.. there is a fee for admission. Saw Two Bald Eagles circling an hour ago it was fantastic. Excellent park with lots of parking. Long calm relaxing scenic walks in your choice of 3 directs. Lots of animals & birds. Takes you right to the Thames river. There's a nice lookout spot in the winter & spring/fall without leaves that lets you see the horizon from a good height. I’ve come here 7 times this year. Great hiking spot would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the expensive parking $5.25 for 2 hours. Great place for a hike just a short drive outside of London Ontario. Parking is paid now, there is a public washroom. Trails are nice along the river. A good mix of hills and valleys, trails in the woods and also through the meadow valleys. Horses allowed on a few trails. Always have a good time here. I thoroughly enjoyed a mid day walk under the canopy of the Komoka treed park. The ground was easy to navigate. There were some slight inclines that required a little extra effort. I used my urban poles which helped with any climbing. This is new and the only upgrade is a public toilet and gravel for the parking area. Beautiful park for walking and hiking. Parking is I think $10, which seems a bit high. Probably one of the areas most beautiful parks with breathtaking scenery from the top of the Thames River looking south west. Huge pines and hardwood trees make a magical setting as you walk under their campy of greenery. 

The only ... Good for a quick hike. The new parking lot although well maintained is overpriced. Good but the parking meter didn't work Parking plentiful but not free. Not really expensive either. But not sure what services you are paying for with the parking fee. Good and relaxing place to take walks. Paid parking 2 h parking for $5.25 seems a bit steep. Park is close to an urban center and main trails are well worn and wide. Finding vistas of the river in an otherwise flat landscape is pretty neat. Wildflowers are abundant (as is poison ivy!!) ... Nice park for hiking.  Annoying how there is a charge for parking now though.  And that they closed the entrance across the park.  2 access points was much more convenient. Great greenspace with a large pond! Beautiful with great trails, It's a very clean and well maintained park that's wonderful for getting out of city life and back into nature! Parking should be free. Great trails and quiet park Nice place to spend some time alone with nature. Make sure to take a picture of park trail route. There are big chances that you might get lost somewhere in the park. Overall nice place. Nice park for hiking.  Annoying how there is a charge for parking now though.  And that they closed the entrance across the park.  2 access points was much more convenient. Always nice, but the parking is just too expensive. Well maintained. No garbage anywhere A beautiful place for hiking, nice trails and kids friendly The trails here are exquisite! Check them out if you have the opportunity. There are a good range of paths at Komoka and several nice spots you can stop off. Whether you are looking for a good hike or somewhere to stop and enjoy nature, this park is great and within a very short distance of London Great walking trails.  Pay for Parking though. A very nice park, a lot of diffrent paths to choose from. One downside is the open field with the sun, very hard to walk in. There's also a lot of steep hills and bugs. If you're planning on hiking here bring LOTS of water and bug spray. Ravines, rivers, and great trees. Deer, owls, turkeys and turtles. Very diverse Great trails. Must pay for parking This place is so beautiful. Very clean trails and facilities. Staff is friendly and very helpful. It's really good for hiking and running. Amazing place for camping and for the family. It has very beautiful scenic sights as well. Recommended 10 outta 10. The drive to get here was very scenic as well Park down the street, if possible, as there is a fee for parking.   Trail is nice.  There construction on the path ...possibly to update the park?  There is fishing spots not to far, even though it is illegal at this time to catch walleye, but as you know everyone does doesn't follow rules. Great place for a hike just outside London. Beautiful views of the Thames River valley, and Carolinian forest. Great for day activity. Picnics for sure! Warning!!  I was shocked to hear that they have placed bear snap traps in the park to catch a beaver. This beaver was displaced in the first place to provide water access for the construction of new homes. Other animals are being caught ... Great place to walk but a little busy and they charge money to park. Wonderful natural park near London that has trails that go though grassland, mature woods and a nice long a river side trail.    

Expensive parking with little amenities. Great place for a short hike. One of the best parks, in and around London! Very long beautiful trails along the river! Lots of parking and many different trails to take! Cardinals, Owels, Blue Jays, Measels, Orioles, all types of wonderful animals! It costs to park here. Around $5 for an hour. The Park itself is okay . This is a great place to hike. It’s not very long but it’s outdoors and it outdoors. Walk the the whole trail at least once. It is just 15 minutes drive from London, but provides a great walkig trail for everyone, even for families with young kids! Beautiful place. Too bad the paid parking completely ruined it. Located on the southside of the Thames River, this scenic park is for nature-lovers and outdoor enthusiasts alike. The main trail runs parallel to the river, overlooking turquoise running water and a vast treetop canopy just beyond it. ... Paid parking has ruined this place. $5.25 for 2 hours is not worth it at all. The trail maintenance is non existent (see picture), the parking lot often has huge pot holes, and the rest rooms are worse than porta potties. Huge cash grab. Great slice of nature near the city of London. Some excellent and tranquil hiking trials with some pretty nice views of the Thames River Valley. Only drawback of it is now pay parking, minimum $5.25 for two hours. Really though that is ... Not happy with the parking charge. But the park itself is beautiful It's ok...for $5.25 worth of parking (that's just for 2 hours) it wasn't really worth it. I'd imagine kids would have a lot of fun playing there but for a hike it's just average. Beautiful trails here! i couldn't understand the empty parking lot when I pulled in.  It used to be such a popular place when I hiked there regularly. Then I noticed the culprit... a ticket vending machine which lets you buy a $5.20 daypass to go for a walk... very sad. Quiet beautiful place for a walk Great park so peaceful! Great place for a walk, but huge money grab for blocking off non pay parking. Not spending nearly as much time there anymore. If you want to enjoy outdoor try Komoka provincial park Was there for our AAA hockey game.  Very clean and spacious.  Good seating and plenty of parking. Nice place for day trip.  Not a good place for a picnic, but lots of nice trails to walk. Some of the paths can also be shared with horses.  

If you don't mind a little walking (10-15 min), you can bring your fishing rod down to the river. Excellent spot to camp or go for hikes Pay parking sucks but the park is great I used to go here all the time, but I refuse to pay for the new parking fee. Don't get me wrong, the trails are ""okay"", but that's it. I have not seen improvements to the park which justify the parking fee. I cant believe they are charging for parking now. I had been going to this park since I was just a young child and always enjoyed the long walks through the woods. You can walk all the way from komoka to deleware or vice versa. Fantastic ... Trails should be better marked, otherwise it's great Really good place to go for a walk Nice park. Prefer the right paths/trails more than the left ones. Saw deer and other little forest creatures here. Downside is that you have to pay for parking, but it is inexpensive. It is a provincial park.  It takes about 2 hours to go to the farthest corner and back. Walkable in winter, but need strap on cleats Pay for parking so you can go outside and walk a trail for exercise?  No wonder people sit on the couch. You can't even go for a nature walk without having to bring a pocket full of change or a Visa anymore. As many others have noted, was a great spot to go for a short hike or walk the dogs before you had to pay $5+ for parking. New parking spot is in a poor spot that doesn't really allow you to have great access to the whole park. Park trails are great, well marked and well kept. Some beautiful views at both park locations. Beautiful place. I have enjoyed many peaceful picnics here. And it's so clean and well kept! Awesome trails to hike around. Feel refreshed after a walk around this trail. I would give this place 5 stars, but the Ontario Government ruined it. $5.25 per/hour to walk around Komoka Trails now. If they can find a way to tax the ... Lovely quiet trail The new parking lot is sizeable. Easy to navigate through the trails. Lots of exploration and scenic views. Very diverse landscape. Coyotes and mountain lion have been spotted here however, keep an eye on smaller animals and children. I used to go hiking every weekend with my dog when it was free. Now you have to pay 5.25 for 2 hours and it's not worth it. Its ridiculous.The place is very nice to hike. I am hiking down the road now at Warbler Woods, it's free. You can go any time. They have put traps around the pond to kill the beaver. They have killed a muskrat. Great place to go for a hike Great place to hike and bring the dogs. Don't like having to pay now though... Nice place for a walk near London ON. Separate walking and biking paths. Washrooms at trailhead. Downside...minimum $5 for 2hrs of parking. $12 daily max. Lots of road noise from surrounding highways.   One of the quiet beauties of London. We regularly go to the Park for a walk, picnic and watch people canoe by.  It is just refreshing. Was a great hiking spot when it was free to park. Now there is a minimum charge of $5 (2 hours), but the amenities don't match that price. There are no picnic areas in the park, no shelters, no BBQs, not many benches. They also haven't ... Beautiful place to hike or fish. Unfortunately the new parking/ entrance charges are a bit much. Surely the high tax rate here in Ontario should be enough to allow us to enjoy our provincial parks. Quiet n clean Very nice location but there is pay parking Well maintained trail system in this ""zero funded"" provincial park. One suggestion is that you map out your route in the park ahead of time. Some trails are poorly marked.

Oxford Street entrance has been permanently closed. Google the park for new parking information prior to your trip. Trails for bikes and horses as well Was great until they made paid parking. It was a nice trail and the woods are beautiful, lots of varied habitats and terrain with some nice views. However... like many of the other reviewers, I agree that the parking fee is kind of extortionate for $5 for 2hrs. If you're going ... Really nice nature preserve outside the city along a high embankment above the river. Really nice trails in the forest. I have enjoying hiking in the park for years,
 but with the up coming expense of parking I see that this will come to an end.   
I do not object to paying for parking, it just that you have put too high of a price on it.  

I am on a ... Overall it's a nice park, but they need to get the trails rationalised and blazed so that they're not as confusing.

It's understandable that things are chaotic, but there is still some work to do before this park gets five stars. Awesome place to hike. Amazing atmosphere, saw few deers. Multiple different look landscapes as well Nice place to go for a walk and enjoy nature to escape the sounds of the city.  Paid parking and washroom available at the main parking lot. Beautiful Not a park it's Teds hugh parcel of land...
Beautyfull I want to purchase it Great place to hike or mountain bike. However, for a parking fee I would expect more trail maintenance, more easily navigable trails, more amenities etc. Awesome place to go hiking, walking, and trail running.
Great, clean trail.

The new parking lot extortion is horrible.  I have never minded dropping a buck or two into provincial park machine.  But $5+ for an hour??   
I'll be going elsewhere - or I will just pull off the road somewhere near an entrance. I feel if you are going to charge for parking then at least improve the trails, otherwise it's still the great hiking spot it's always been  The bridges, crossings and trails are not maintained and poorly marked. A lot of the concrete footings on bridges and staircases are falling apart. Some of the west blue /orange trails were almost abandoned. For a provincial park that charges $5-7 for parking I expected better maintenance, especially mid season. It's pretty and a nice walk, but the fact that they put in a parking meter makes it almost not worth it when there are other places you can go for free. It's a minimum of $5 every time you go. For myself, I found that the trails didn't ... Best place in London area for a hike. Great views. Well maintained. It won't dissapoint. (edit. this place is now pay per use. overpriced. terrible decision. you guys made a big mistake.  I'm changing my 5 star to  a 1 star, and not likely to revisit) Good trails over a variety of terrain - some lovely views of river too.  A great place to go for a walk or a bike ride - particularly early in the morning.
Lots of places to go - lots of paths to explore.
Not too far from the city but you feel as though you are way out in the country. Never went for a hike there but always has people and pets. Very clean area and lots of laughs so must be a good time in the woods. Hopefully going to go for a hike there soon. The parking lot needs to be redone though, some pot holes but avoidable  Great spot, but costs over $5 now for parking  It's a nice place to go for the day or spend a few hours going for a hike. Parking rates are a little rediculous. Love the park, great spot for hiking.  Not happy they put in the pay parking lots.  I don't go here anymore because there are so many free trails in the area. What a fun hike we had ! The leaves were all types of colors. Fantastic time in general  Small, but quite pretty. Good place to walk dogs or go on a short hike. Multitude of atmospheres including open fields, carolinian forest, open red forests, etc. Very good hike in the backyard of London. I enjoyed it thoroughly. However, a hiking trail map might be useful for the location, along with some garbage bins at the entrance for people to be able to throw their trash. Very nice They want you to pay to walk on a path Fantastic place to hike all year long. My go to oasis near the city but I will not pay $175 per year to walk in the woods.  I personally never had a problem parking there and my family enjoyed many short trips to the park. Should include in your summer visit activity list Nature at it's finest. Great trails and hiking. Was fishing there this weekend and caught a couple large mouth bass and decent walleye. Not worth the $5 you pay for parking. If you go then try and find parking on a side road. it gets one star because you have to give it a rating---Ran, hiked, and walked this trail for 2 decades- now its a pay to play park - improvement to park a bathroom and a pay meter. It is has become a park for those who have large amounts of disposable income. MONEY GRAB!! Very nice trails that never end :) to much trash though  Beautiful park but the paid parking is ridiculous. Also large piles of horse manure on some trails.  Great trails and good fishing spots.   Really beautiful!!! Nice place, but I'm not going to pay what they are asking for parking. Fantastic place to get lost! Best nature walk in the London area. Unlike most of the other reviews here, I was not quite as impressed with this place as other visitors were. First of all, there's no maps anywhere along the trail that explain where to go or which trail to follow. It's very easy to walk ... This was a very nice free hiking trail. Now as of Aug. Our province decided to charge to park your car. Iam Not happy about this to say the least. Wonderful trails. Bring water and a snack. This place draws you in for a long walk up and down hills alongside the Thames. Worth it. Peaceful and beautiful trail to walk and enjoy
Full of dense trees
Ear catching sound of wind in the trees Excellent trails and lots of parking. Landscape is beautiful. Nice trails, just watch out for the mountain bikers ripping around and dog poop. Unfortunately, park is not serviced as much as it should be. No garbage cans in parking lots and POA officers not seen too often on trails enforcing laws and regulations. The trees and river valley will make your day! Nice trail. Very good for a short out long walk. Great place for a in the woods casual hike Trails are lovely and well groomed  Great trails!  Good for biking and walking. Our dog loves walking here.  Nice hiking spot on the Thames River.  Longest trail will take an hour or so to complete. Pay the parking fee (if you're a regular you should buy an Ontario Parks Pass at a campground) and wander fields and forest to the river's edge! An okay fishing experience.  Access is via a long wet walk back to the car after slipping into the water :) Great place for a family day Just paying for parking issue It is a great place to go for a hike/walk, but this silly parking situation is definitely a bit annoying. (Used to be free) Awesome trails and some great views! Nice place for long walking.  Just walk and enjoying  Beautiful trails Nice park, but permit fees are excessive.  Hidden gem! This was okay but not that great for a place that makes you pay  Paid parking is unfortunate but still a great escape from the city  Great natural setting My favorite place to hike and bike. A beautiful retreat from the city Beautiful place Paid parking and no improvement Used to be a frequent visitor but changes to parking cost means I will hike in an alternative location. Gorgeous ❤ Awesome hiking Nice  Great trails nice 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 (Translated by Google) Very good. Autumn leaves are so cool. One thing is not having a rest and no wash basin to wash your hands.

I'd imagine kids would have a lot of fun playing there but for a hike it's just average. Beautiful trails here! i couldn't understand the empty parking lot when I pulled in.  It used to be such a popular place when I hiked there regularly. Then I noticed the culprit... a ticket vending machine which lets you buy a $5.20 daypass to go for a walk... very sad. Quiet beautiful place for a walk Great park so peaceful! Great place for a walk, but huge money grab for blocking off non pay parking. Not spending nearly as much time there anymore. If you want to enjoy outdoor try Komoka provincial park Was there for our AAA hockey game.  Very clean and spacious.  Good seating and plenty of parking. Nice place for day trip.  Not a good place for a picnic, but lots of nice trails to walk. Some of the paths can also be shared with horses.  

If you don't mind a little walking (10-15 min), you can bring your fishing rod down to the river. Excellent spot to camp or go for hikes Pay parking sucks but the park is great I used to go here all the time, but I refuse to pay for the new parking fee. Don't get me wrong, the trails are ""okay"", but that's it. I have not seen improvements to the park which justify the parking fee. I cant believe they are charging for parking now. I had been going to this park since I was just a young child and always enjoyed the long walks through the woods. You can walk all the way from komoka to deleware or vice versa. Fantastic ... Trails should be better marked, otherwise it's great Really good place to go for a walk Nice park. Prefer the right paths/trails more than the left ones. Saw deer and other little forest creatures here. Downside is that you have to pay for parking, but it is inexpensive. It is a provincial park.  It takes about 2 hours to go to the farthest corner and back. Walkable in winter, but need strap on cleats Pay for parking so you can go outside and walk a trail for exercise?  No wonder people sit on the couch. You can't even go for a nature walk without having to bring a pocket full of change or a Visa anymore. As many others have noted, was a great spot to go for a short hike or walk the dogs before you had to pay $5+ for parking. New parking spot is in a poor spot that doesn't really allow you to have great access to the whole park. Park trails are great, well marked and well kept. Some beautiful views at both park locations. Beautiful place. I have enjoyed many peaceful picnics here. And it's so clean and well kept! Awesome trails to hike around. Feel refreshed after a walk around this trail. I would give this place 5 stars, but the Ontario Government ruined it. $5.25 per/hour to walk around Komoka Trails now. If they can find a way to tax the ... Lovely quiet trail The new parking lot is sizeable. Easy to navigate through the trails. Lots of exploration and scenic views. Very diverse landscape. Coyotes and mountain lion have been spotted here however, keep an eye on smaller animals and children. I used to go hiking every weekend with my dog when it was free. Now you have to pay 5.25 for 2 hours and it's not worth it. Its ridiculous.The place is very nice to hike. I am hiking down the road now at Warbler Woods, it's free. You can go any time. They have put traps around the pond to kill the beaver. They have killed a muskrat. Great place to go for a hike Great place to hike and bring the dogs. Don't like having to pay now though... Nice place for a walk near London ON. Separate walking and biking paths. Washrooms at trailhead. Downside...minimum $5 for 2hrs of parking. $12 daily max. Lots of road noise from surrounding highways.   One of the quiet beauties of London. We regularly go to the Park for a walk, picnic and watch people canoe by.  It is just refreshing. Was a great hiking spot when it was free to park. Now there is a minimum charge of $5 (2 hours), but the amenities don't match that price. There are no picnic areas in the park, no shelters, no BBQs, not many benches. They also haven't ... Beautiful place to hike or fish. Unfortunately the new parking/ entrance charges are a bit much. Surely the high tax rate here in Ontario should be enough to allow us to enjoy our provincial parks. Quiet n clean Very nice location but there is pay parking Well maintained trail system in this ""zero funded"" provincial park. One suggestion is that you map out your route in the park ahead of time. Some trails are poorly marked.

Oxford Street entrance has been permanently closed. Google the park for new parking information prior to your trip. Trails for bikes and horses as well Was great until they made paid parking. It was a nice trail and the woods are beautiful, lots of varied habitats and terrain with some nice views. However... like many of the other reviewers, I agree that the parking fee is kind of extortionate for $5 for 2hrs. If you're going ... Really nice nature preserve outside the city along a high embankment above the river. Really nice trails in the forest. I have enjoying hiking in the park for years,
 but with the up coming expense of parking I see that this will come to an end.   
I do not object to paying for parking, it just that you have put too high of a price on it.  

I am on a ... Overall it's a nice park, but they need to get the trails rationalised and blazed so that they're not as confusing.

It's understandable that things are chaotic, but there is still some work to do before this park gets five stars. Awesome place to hike. Amazing atmosphere, saw few deers. Multiple different look landscapes as well Nice place to go for a walk and enjoy nature to escape the sounds of the city.  Paid parking and washroom available at the main parking lot. Beautiful Not a park it's Teds hugh parcel of land...
Beautyfull I want to purchase it Great place to hike or mountain bike. However, for a parking fee I would expect more trail maintenance, more easily navigable trails, more amenities etc. Awesome place to go hiking, walking, and trail running.
Great, clean trail.

The new parking lot extortion is horrible.  I have never minded dropping a buck or two into provincial park machine.  But $5+ for an hour??   
I'll be going elsewhere - or I will just pull off the road somewhere near an entrance. I feel if you are going to charge for parking then at least improve the trails, otherwise it's still the great hiking spot it's always been  The bridges, crossings and trails are not maintained and poorly marked. A lot of the concrete footings on bridges and staircases are falling apart. Some of the west blue /orange trails were almost abandoned. For a provincial park that charges $5-7 for parking I expected better maintenance, especially mid season. It's pretty and a nice walk, but the fact that they put in a parking meter makes it almost not worth it when there are other places you can go for free. It's a minimum of $5 every time you go. For myself, I found that the trails didn't ... Best place in London area for a hike. Great views. Well maintained. It won't dissapoint. (edit. this place is now pay per use. overpriced. terrible decision. you guys made a big mistake.  I'm changing my 5 star to  a 1 star, and not likely to revisit) Good trails over a variety of terrain - some lovely views of river too.  A great place to go for a walk or a bike ride - particularly early in the morning.
Lots of places to go - lots of paths to explore.
Not too far from the city but you feel as though you are way out in the country. Never went for a hike there but always has people and pets. Very clean area and lots of laughs so must be a good time in the woods. Hopefully going to go for a hike there soon. The parking lot needs to be redone though, some pot holes but avoidable  Great spot, but costs over $5 now for parking  It's a nice place to go for the day or spend a few hours going for a hike. Parking rates are a little rediculous. Love the park, great spot for hiking.  Not happy they put in the pay parking lots.  I don't go here anymore because there are so many free trails in the area. What a fun hike we had ! The leaves were all types of colors. Fantastic time in general  Small, but quite pretty. Good place to walk dogs or go on a short hike. Multitude of atmospheres including open fields, carolinian forest, open red forests, etc. Very good hike in the backyard of London. I enjoyed it thoroughly. However, a hiking trail map might be useful for the location, along with some garbage bins at the entrance for people to be able to throw their trash. Very nice They want you to pay to walk on a path Fantastic place to hike all year long. My go to oasis near the city but I will not pay $175 per year to walk in the woods.  I personally never had a problem parking there and my family enjoyed many short trips to the park. Should include in your summer visit activity list Nature at it's finest. Great trails and hiking. Was fishing there this weekend and caught a couple large mouth bass and decent walleye. Not worth the $5 you pay for parking. If you go then try and find parking on a side road. it gets one star because you have to give it a rating---Ran, hiked, and walked this trail for 2 decades- now its a pay to play park - improvement to park a bathroom and a pay meter. It is has become a park for those who have large amounts of disposable income. MONEY GRAB!! Very nice trails that never end :) to much trash though  Beautiful park but the paid parking is ridiculous. Also large piles of horse manure on some trails.  Great trails and good fishing spots.   Really beautiful!!! Nice place, but I'm not going to pay what they are asking for parking. Fantastic place to get lost! Best nature walk in the London area. Unlike most of the other reviews here, I was not quite as impressed with this place as other visitors were. First of all, there's no maps anywhere along the trail that explain where to go or which trail to follow. It's very easy to walk ... This was a very nice free hiking trail. Now as of Aug. Our province decided to charge to park your car. Iam Not happy about this to say the least. Wonderful trails. Bring water and a snack. This place draws you in for a long walk up and down hills alongside the Thames. Worth it. Peaceful and beautiful trail to walk and enjoy
Full of dense trees
Ear catching sound of wind in the trees Excellent trails and lots of parking. Landscape is beautiful. Nice trails, just watch out for the mountain bikers ripping around and dog poop. Unfortunately, park is not serviced as much as it should be. No garbage cans in parking lots and POA officers not seen too often on trails enforcing laws and regulations. The trees and river valley will make your day! Nice trail. Very good for a short out long walk. Great place for a in the woods casual hike Trails are lovely and well groomed  Great trails!  Good for biking and walking. Our dog loves walking here.  Nice hiking spot on the Thames River.  Longest trail will take an hour or so to complete. Pay the parking fee (if you're a regular you should buy an Ontario Parks Pass at a campground) and wander fields and forest to the river's edge! An okay fishing experience.  Access is via a long wet walk back to the car after slipping into the water :) Great place for a family day Just paying for parking issue It is a great place to go for a hike/walk, but this silly parking situation is definitely a bit annoying. (Used to be free) Awesome trails and some great views! Nice place for long walking.  Just walk and enjoying  Beautiful trails Nice park, but permit fees are excessive.  Hidden gem! This was okay but not that great for a place that makes you pay  Paid parking is unfortunate but still a great escape from the city  Great natural setting My favorite place to hike and bike. A beautiful retreat from the city Beautiful place Paid parking and no improvement Used to be a frequent visitor but changes to parking cost means I will hike in an alternative location. Gorgeous ❤ Awesome hiking Nice  Great trails nice 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌 (Translated by Google) Very good. Autumn leaves are so cool. One thing is not having a rest and no wash basin to wash your hands.

But make sure you get yourself a cheese platter and wine next door before you leave. You won't be sorry. Very beautiful setting ,gorgeous Lake on one side, stunning views on the other. Restaurant is good, plus craft beer. Amazing place. Words cannot describe how beautiful this place is. Plus the way to get there is so pretty. Be sure to stop by and enjoy the view!! A real beauty to see Wonderful place. Lots of great views in the surrounding areas. The view was amazing and its not too far from downtown picton Absolutely perfect. I had the chief’s special. It was lake trout that was caught in the same county. It was perfectly cooked servers with vegetables and basmati rice. I sat on the patio with a great view of the marvelous Lake On The ... It is the second time at this restaurant and it was just as good as the first. Decent prices, great staff in person. Over the phone the girl was rude, but it's a minor thing. The food was pretentious without being anything more than ok.  Old fashioned and boring.  The lakes and mountains however were spectacular. People wonder where is the source of water.
It may be underground spring and winter snowfall and raining collection. For sute the lakes ground is a thick layer of clay. Nice little lake at the top of the mountain, definitely a great spot for a picnic,. but overal felt there was not too much to do. Couple of smaller restaurants and patios nearby. There was also washrooms and a parking lot. A bit busy even on a weekday in summer, but the beautiful view is worth it. You may have to wait for a table at any of the restaurants nearby, so plan accordingly. There's also a microbrewery at the bottom of the hill. Wonderful view, nice Park  interesting history. Nice place. Restaurants are great This place is amazing. The view is absolutely incredible. Be sure to grab a table at the Miller house on the back patio. Very scenic with the view of the lake and the Glenora ferry as it runs across the bay. Cute restaurant and inn located on the mountain. Small lake on the mountain but cute place for a picnic. Beautiful place and would love to go again but the surrounding business' need to pull their finger out.
Nothing around that accommodated pets so I had to wait outside whilst my spouse purchased a meal and ate it just so she could use the ... Neat spot - beautiful views. Great place to visit. I'm certain to return for a stay. Quaint little lake . Not much going on unfortunately. More regrettably it seemed a bit run down. What would have been a superb view of the bay was pretty much blocked by the overgrown shrubbery in front of the fencing. The sunset is magnificent. Panoramic views well worth the drive. Will be back here again sometime for sure. A beautifully unique spot. On one side of the road you have a lake that formed on top of a ""mountain"". Clear, undisturbed, serene with plaques describing its formation. On the other side of the road is a magnificent view out over the Reach where you can watch the ferry take its load from on side to the other. Especially beautiful in the fall. Awesome for a latte, stunning view on an elegant patio overlooking the ferry route far below.  Charcuterie plate was small but high quality.  Also tried a flatbread pizza with gorgonzola, onion which was quite good. Did I mention the stunning view? Perfect place to relax with lake view from mountain!! Beautiful and very scenic, perfect for an individual looking for some quick time, a couple looking to ad some romance or even a family looking at beauties of life. Great view of the bay and a beautiful little lake on the mountain! 2 restaurants. Million dollar vista from the Miller House Brewery pub at the top of the hill. Fine dining at the Miller Inn. A nice view when looking out through the fence but kinda booting up top. There is a nice boardwalk and sitting area to enjoy the view. Parking and picnic tables are available and there is a restaurant that is usually pretty full during the summer close by View is awesome but no facilities for visitor, local public officer should look into it so that visitors dnt get stuck !! We stumbled upon this area. But it's beautiful! We will be back for sure! Fabulous place. Worth a visit if you're in the area. Beautiful view of the Glenora Ferry! Amazing views of two beautiful lakes. There is a small parking lot maintained by Ontario Parks. The best food I have eat in Ontario Beautiful area of Prince Edward county with two fabulous restaurants. Love this place every time I go here. Lovely people, great views, food and drinks. There are mainly two restaurants with patios here close to the lake. Go to the one that is closer to the lake. They are simply better with their drinks, food and service. Interesting point of view....I recommend as a stop look.... Not it's all cracked up to be. windy. lovely park, great view over the county Very unique experience, probably not many places on earth 🌍 that you would see this. If you're in The County and don't pop up and have a look, you're missing out. Totally fantastic place to visit and spend time at One of our favorite places in Ontario Cool stop for a picnic. Breathtaking natural wonder with a fascinating story. A little out of the way but worth the detour, only wish there were more places to eat around there and that there was something open in the winter. Loved the lake and the view but the restaurant on the same side of the street as the lake was over priced and two of us out of the four did not like their meals. Very limited menu. We return here yearly.  Great place to visit in Prune Edward County with a beautiful lake above the water table, intriguing.  Great food! Good view and good food... Beautiful views of the Bay of Quinte. Beautiful place. Amazing reading how it formed and the history around it. A historical site to view Picton Bay and ferry across it. The lake itself is not very exciting. If there were 6 stars to offer for a rating, I would! There is no chance you can stand here and not be overcome by the beauty of the view. Having recently moved to the west coast, we will miss visiting the County ... if you have yet to discover this magical area, I envy you finding it for the first time :) Enjoy!! Nice scenic view of Glencoe bay and ferry. Very cool place to visit Cool little spot to stop for a visit. It seems odd to be standing beside a lake way up on the mountain and then looking way, way down to the water below. super good So pretty It's a lake that happens to be on a mountain near another body of water. If you've seen a lake before, prepare to be disappointed. There are literally hundreds of places in Ontario that I would rank as more impressive than this. Not worth 5 minutes of your time, at most. Very picturesque Beautiful little park.  Lots of history. Lake on the mountain or mystery lake is a body of water on top of a hill (duh). Legend says it might be a altar of god's and nobody seems to know the source of water. My wife and I try to stop in any time we're in the County. Great food, beer, and patio. This place is so beautiful in every season ❌⭕ All the Majesty of the Prince's County. Ferry ride was fun. The restaurant by the lake is nice. Not much to do in this very small town tho. Beautiful place. Interesting place but very confusing.  On one side of the road is a small parking area with restrooms and a few picnic tables overlooking the Bay. Lake on the Mountain is located on the opposite side and is not visible from the road with ... A very picturesque spot with a lake on a mountain. Awesome service and great food Unique and beautiful feature of Prince Edward county. Stopped in for a coffee at Miller's. Great vantage point to see the bay below. Well worth the pit stop on the way back. Nice place for a quick visit, not too much to do unless you are eating at the nearby restaurant. To face one direction you look across a beautiful LAKE.  Do a 180 turn and you watch a ferry cross the river about 100 feet below you.  very scenic! Gorgeous scenery. Found it as a random stop and was blown away. Make sure to take the ferry after Beautiful location,  a must see The County is famous for it''s atmosphere of artisan wineries and fantastic beaches, but there's another ""Lake"" that does not get enough attention. Lake on the Mountain is located not far from, and above the 
Glenora Ferry, and it's ... Beautiful view. Unique, fantastic place. It's worth the visit in any season of the year. Reasonably scenic, with a ferry rides. Nice view here, but there's not much things to do.
They have washroom so don't worry. One of the natures wonder Interesting views.  Could be better with more information.  Bring a sweater or light jacket when going.  It was 28c when we went by lake Ontario, but felt like 10c at lake on a mountain because of the elevation and strong breeze! Good place Beautiful view. Great views! The cool thing is that there's a lake, on a mountain top, with no apparent source feeding it. If you stand at the roadway you can see the elevated lake, and much further below the bay that's at Lake Ontario level. Limited facilities (washrooms seasonal). A perfect place to relax and unwind. Enjoying nature's beauty and mystery. Beautiful spot A great sight seeing area with two seasonal restaurants. Fantastic view and close to a wonderful array of amenities, restaurants, and breweries. Location,Food&Drink...Life is good! Great spot to stop and grab a bite to eat and a drink. Great views, friendly staff. Will be returning! Not as impressive as expected This really great place and definitely stop by when going to or from Kingston. Parking is bit limited but worth visiting and the view of Lake at the bottom and top of hill is amazing.  Lovely Lovely Very interesting geological formation, fascinating in fact...  however the area is a bit run down - could be a whole lot nicer with some attention to maintenance and landscaping. Beautiful place Great views A beautiful spot with lakes on both sides of the road. The lake on the mountain is 30 metres deep and is quite amazing to look at. Great views and a historical site. Also a good place for viewing the stars. Not much to do unless you have a kayak to explore the lake. No walks. Despite this shortcoming it has great views over the Glenorra Ferry and is a nice place (Winter or Summer) to stop and enjoy a picnic. Washrooms available not sure if they are still open during winter months. Beautiful views!! Very unusual place. but totally worth it. Beautiful views. Great food and view Setting was gorgeous, but $17 for a bowl of poutine was somewhat excessive, although good.  Great location, good food, beautiful scenery.  Pretty, but no public trails around the lake. Good foods and services 
. Be careful lineup in high season.  Love this place Beautiful spot. Great if you're in the area and want to see a nice view with very little time. Beautiful views of both the lake and the bay.
..close to the Glendora ferry if you are continuing on east....also a couple of cozy restaurants and private-owned cabins/lodging to rent nearby Beautiful view even in the rain Great view Was slightly disappointed about the size and location of the picnic area. For a provincial park we had expected more of an area to put down a blanket and relax by the water. There are 3 or 4 picnic tables along the short and rocky coast ... Nice place to visit. Strange feeling when you see 2 different levels of lakes from one place. Went there every year camping as a kid. Wonderful memories. Loved the sand dunes nearby. Will take own family again soon. This area has a lot of diversity: the view high above of Lake Ontario where you can see Loyalist Parkway continue via the free ferry that runs from Glenora to the section of road that continues east to Kingston and beyond and a small ... It's a beautiful scenic spot Beautiful place. Interesting phenomenon. Nice little area to enjoy a picnic lunch. The nature and relaxation great for everyone to injoy  A bit small in terms of parking and the boardwalk area, but the scenery is fantastic. Amazing place Love this place Very cool spot. Very interesting. You have to see it. Beautiful place, must-see in the county Very pretty and accessible spot.  Very cool spot, looked like a great area for a swim Adorable spot. Drive up to get to the lake, then look across the road and down on the Glenora ferry. It defies logic, gravity should pull the water down not push it up, how did it get there? We stayed at Lake on the Mountain resort in September, 2014.  We were quoted the wrong rate and upon arrival were told that the cost would be much higher which was very disappointing.  We were not offered a credit of any kind just the ... Interesting site to visit if you're in the area  I was there around 15yrs ago and I felt so much peace. I could also feel calmness from the native spirits. My friend and I just sat on a little bench staring at the lake in silence for about an hour. When we left we were so relaxed . We ... A little known wonder of nature.. Onokenoga... Nice Very calm and beautiful view of the lake!  Great for a coffee or food on the patio... Paradise in Canada Beautiful views here .

You may have to wait for a table at any of the restaurants nearby, so plan accordingly. There's also a microbrewery at the bottom of the hill. Wonderful view, nice Park  interesting history. Nice place. Restaurants are great This place is amazing. The view is absolutely incredible. Be sure to grab a table at the Miller house on the back patio. Very scenic with the view of the lake and the Glenora ferry as it runs across the bay. Cute restaurant and inn located on the mountain. Small lake on the mountain but cute place for a picnic. Beautiful place and would love to go again but the surrounding business' need to pull their finger out.
Nothing around that accommodated pets so I had to wait outside whilst my spouse purchased a meal and ate it just so she could use the ... Neat spot - beautiful views. Great place to visit. I'm certain to return for a stay. Quaint little lake . Not much going on unfortunately. More regrettably it seemed a bit run down. What would have been a superb view of the bay was pretty much blocked by the overgrown shrubbery in front of the fencing. The sunset is magnificent. Panoramic views well worth the drive. Will be back here again sometime for sure. A beautifully unique spot. On one side of the road you have a lake that formed on top of a ""mountain"". Clear, undisturbed, serene with plaques describing its formation. On the other side of the road is a magnificent view out over the Reach where you can watch the ferry take its load from on side to the other. Especially beautiful in the fall. Awesome for a latte, stunning view on an elegant patio overlooking the ferry route far below.  Charcuterie plate was small but high quality.  Also tried a flatbread pizza with gorgonzola, onion which was quite good. Did I mention the stunning view? Perfect place to relax with lake view from mountain!! Beautiful and very scenic, perfect for an individual looking for some quick time, a couple looking to ad some romance or even a family looking at beauties of life. Great view of the bay and a beautiful little lake on the mountain! 2 restaurants. Million dollar vista from the Miller House Brewery pub at the top of the hill. Fine dining at the Miller Inn. A nice view when looking out through the fence but kinda booting up top. There is a nice boardwalk and sitting area to enjoy the view. Parking and picnic tables are available and there is a restaurant that is usually pretty full during the summer close by View is awesome but no facilities for visitor, local public officer should look into it so that visitors dnt get stuck !! We stumbled upon this area. But it's beautiful! We will be back for sure! Fabulous place. Worth a visit if you're in the area. Beautiful view of the Glenora Ferry! Amazing views of two beautiful lakes. There is a small parking lot maintained by Ontario Parks. The best food I have eat in Ontario Beautiful area of Prince Edward county with two fabulous restaurants. Love this place every time I go here. Lovely people, great views, food and drinks. There are mainly two restaurants with patios here close to the lake. Go to the one that is closer to the lake. They are simply better with their drinks, food and service. Interesting point of view....I recommend as a stop look.... Not it's all cracked up to be. windy. lovely park, great view over the county Very unique experience, probably not many places on earth 🌍 that you would see this. If you're in The County and don't pop up and have a look, you're missing out. Totally fantastic place to visit and spend time at One of our favorite places in Ontario Cool stop for a picnic. Breathtaking natural wonder with a fascinating story. A little out of the way but worth the detour, only wish there were more places to eat around there and that there was something open in the winter. Loved the lake and the view but the restaurant on the same side of the street as the lake was over priced and two of us out of the four did not like their meals. Very limited menu. We return here yearly.  Great place to visit in Prune Edward County with a beautiful lake above the water table, intriguing.  Great food! Good view and good food... Beautiful views of the Bay of Quinte. Beautiful place. Amazing reading how it formed and the history around it. A historical site to view Picton Bay and ferry across it. The lake itself is not very exciting. If there were 6 stars to offer for a rating, I would! There is no chance you can stand here and not be overcome by the beauty of the view. Having recently moved to the west coast, we will miss visiting the County ... if you have yet to discover this magical area, I envy you finding it for the first time :) Enjoy!! Nice scenic view of Glencoe bay and ferry. Very cool place to visit Cool little spot to stop for a visit. It seems odd to be standing beside a lake way up on the mountain and then looking way, way down to the water below. super good So pretty It's a lake that happens to be on a mountain near another body of water. If you've seen a lake before, prepare to be disappointed. There are literally hundreds of places in Ontario that I would rank as more impressive than this. Not worth 5 minutes of your time, at most. Very picturesque Beautiful little park.  Lots of history. Lake on the mountain or mystery lake is a body of water on top of a hill (duh). Legend says it might be a altar of god's and nobody seems to know the source of water. My wife and I try to stop in any time we're in the County. Great food, beer, and patio. This place is so beautiful in every season ❌⭕ All the Majesty of the Prince's County. Ferry ride was fun. The restaurant by the lake is nice. Not much to do in this very small town tho. Beautiful place. Interesting place but very confusing.  On one side of the road is a small parking area with restrooms and a few picnic tables overlooking the Bay. Lake on the Mountain is located on the opposite side and is not visible from the road with ... A very picturesque spot with a lake on a mountain. Awesome service and great food Unique and beautiful feature of Prince Edward county. Stopped in for a coffee at Miller's. Great vantage point to see the bay below. Well worth the pit stop on the way back. Nice place for a quick visit, not too much to do unless you are eating at the nearby restaurant. To face one direction you look across a beautiful LAKE.  Do a 180 turn and you watch a ferry cross the river about 100 feet below you.  very scenic! Gorgeous scenery. Found it as a random stop and was blown away. Make sure to take the ferry after Beautiful location,  a must see The County is famous for it''s atmosphere of artisan wineries and fantastic beaches, but there's another ""Lake"" that does not get enough attention. Lake on the Mountain is located not far from, and above the 
Glenora Ferry, and it's ... Beautiful view. Unique, fantastic place. It's worth the visit in any season of the year. Reasonably scenic, with a ferry rides. Nice view here, but there's not much things to do.
They have washroom so don't worry. One of the natures wonder Interesting views.  Could be better with more information.  Bring a sweater or light jacket when going.  It was 28c when we went by lake Ontario, but felt like 10c at lake on a mountain because of the elevation and strong breeze! Good place Beautiful view. Great views! The cool thing is that there's a lake, on a mountain top, with no apparent source feeding it. If you stand at the roadway you can see the elevated lake, and much further below the bay that's at Lake Ontario level. Limited facilities (washrooms seasonal). A perfect place to relax and unwind. Enjoying nature's beauty and mystery. Beautiful spot A great sight seeing area with two seasonal restaurants. Fantastic view and close to a wonderful array of amenities, restaurants, and breweries. Location,Food&Drink...Life is good! Great spot to stop and grab a bite to eat and a drink. Great views, friendly staff. Will be returning! Not as impressive as expected This really great place and definitely stop by when going to or from Kingston. Parking is bit limited but worth visiting and the view of Lake at the bottom and top of hill is amazing.  Lovely Lovely Very interesting geological formation, fascinating in fact...  however the area is a bit run down - could be a whole lot nicer with some attention to maintenance and landscaping. Beautiful place Great views A beautiful spot with lakes on both sides of the road. The lake on the mountain is 30 metres deep and is quite amazing to look at. Great views and a historical site. Also a good place for viewing the stars. Not much to do unless you have a kayak to explore the lake. No walks. Despite this shortcoming it has great views over the Glenorra Ferry and is a nice place (Winter or Summer) to stop and enjoy a picnic. Washrooms available not sure if they are still open during winter months. Beautiful views!! Very unusual place. but totally worth it. Beautiful views. Great food and view Setting was gorgeous, but $17 for a bowl of poutine was somewhat excessive, although good.  Great location, good food, beautiful scenery.  Pretty, but no public trails around the lake. Good foods and services 
. Be careful lineup in high season.  Love this place Beautiful spot. Great if you're in the area and want to see a nice view with very little time. Beautiful views of both the lake and the bay.
..close to the Glendora ferry if you are continuing on east....also a couple of cozy restaurants and private-owned cabins/lodging to rent nearby Beautiful view even in the rain Great view Was slightly disappointed about the size and location of the picnic area. For a provincial park we had expected more of an area to put down a blanket and relax by the water. There are 3 or 4 picnic tables along the short and rocky coast ... Nice place to visit. Strange feeling when you see 2 different levels of lakes from one place. Went there every year camping as a kid. Wonderful memories. Loved the sand dunes nearby. Will take own family again soon. This area has a lot of diversity: the view high above of Lake Ontario where you can see Loyalist Parkway continue via the free ferry that runs from Glenora to the section of road that continues east to Kingston and beyond and a small ... It's a beautiful scenic spot Beautiful place. Interesting phenomenon. Nice little area to enjoy a picnic lunch. The nature and relaxation great for everyone to injoy  A bit small in terms of parking and the boardwalk area, but the scenery is fantastic. Amazing place Love this place Very cool spot. Very interesting. You have to see it. Beautiful place, must-see in the county Very pretty and accessible spot.  Very cool spot, looked like a great area for a swim Adorable spot. Drive up to get to the lake, then look across the road and down on the Glenora ferry. It defies logic, gravity should pull the water down not push it up, how did it get there? We stayed at Lake on the Mountain resort in September, 2014.  We were quoted the wrong rate and upon arrival were told that the cost would be much higher which was very disappointing.  We were not offered a credit of any kind just the ... Interesting site to visit if you're in the area  I was there around 15yrs ago and I felt so much peace. I could also feel calmness from the native spirits. My friend and I just sat on a little bench staring at the lake in silence for about an hour. When we left we were so relaxed . We ... A little known wonder of nature.. Onokenoga... Nice Very calm and beautiful view of the lake!  Great for a coffee or food on the patio... Paradise in Canada Beautiful views here . Pretty spot for a walk n talk. Cool place. Beauty Good view, nice lake, calm. Good food, good service, wonderful location! Great food and Fabulous Patio Beautiful place. Very relaxing view. Beautiful scenery Beautiful lookout Amazing place! Absolutely stunning So cool to see! Spectacular view . Nice place to visit  A lake on a up lift unusual...to see.  Fascination with the concept. Beautiful place to visit It's just a high up lake. Great place to fish  Beautiful place Nice view. how is it that the lake level is higher then all the water around it? Beautiful My Favoriten Place on Prince Edward county Beautiful scenery, quiet Perfect setting A hidden gem in the middle of Prince Edward County. It is literally a lake on a mountain.

Don't count on the water being warm. We went the second week of August and being the true Canadians that we are, it was quite (shall we say) refreshing. Surprisingly beautiful park just hours north of Sault Ste. Marie. The park has a headquarters with bathroom facilities but is mostly primitive. There is some hiking, canoeing, and several from-the-car strolls. No food except up in Wawa. We had a great spot with the lake right in front of us! There was lots to do and see! Showers and bathrooms and laundry facilities. Power hook up was a bit far but we had plenty of cord. The sound of the waves was incredible! A thunder ... I love this place. Definitely want to buy property in this area someday.  I wish my family had not immigrated to Wisconsin! I love Canada! Nice campground. Bit isolated though. An hour to Wawa for shops. Transcanada  can be noisy as it is very close to the park. Lot of tractor trailers going all night. Amazing views of fall colors in the end of September, start of October. Drove past the park in fall. Amazing scenery and twists. The lake and mountain combination on road is mesmerizing. Lake Superior Provincial Park,  Agawa campground is amazing. 
The coastal drive to get there is breathtaking. I tented, but you can easily rent a cabin or lodge along the way. 
The flora and fauna is very different from Southern Ontario. ... I visited the park a few years ago. This park is awesome! Everything is bigger in this region. We had a great time from camping at Gargantua Bay to hiking the Sand River and even bushwhacking to a campsite that was not used in years. 

If it was not so far from Toronto I would visit more often. It's on Lake Superior. It's beautiful. The park offers many trails. Both campgrounds are amazing. All the staff we've dealt with are excellent. I mean it's on Lake Superior...what more do you need !!!! This part of Ontario is gorgeous. The lake is shimmering from the Ontario side. The hike down to the petroglyphs is rugged in places. The cables along the rocks are in need of repair. The government needs to put some money into improving ... This place is beautiful and even if it's hard to get here you should probably go. I cycled through the park which is both properly hilly and amazing.

We took the fall tour and the colors were unbelievable. Highly recommended the trip. Largest fresh water lake!! Very exciting place!

Staff great, park itself is large and very nice. Lot of good hiking trails. Comfort stations are in good shape. Mediocre rating due to overgrown state of agawa bay campground electric sites. Very hard to fit trailers into many sites they ... Beautiful scenery, plenty of trails, lookouts and campsites. Trails we visited were physically demanding. Don't recommend for parents with children under 10. Park is awesome in terms of dense forest and various places to visit as well as different trails and waterfalls. Park facility needs to improve including washroom cleanliness. Nice trails with great views of superior lake itself , great view in the larger campground with clean and new showers butvery old comfort station in the smaller campground Awesome hiking along the north shore. Rent a canoe and go to Miji lakefor a couple of days.
Great camp sites interior, beaches all to yourself. Stayed there 2 nights. I remember camping there back in the 60's with family and climbing the rocks and swimming in the Cold Lake. Great place to be on the beach at sunset. It took me about 14 hours to even reach here but it was worth every single second. What a well preserved place. With clean facilities and friendly staff, it is an absolute must-see bucket list worthy experience. The lake itself... Stunning. This park was very splendid and the scenery was bewitching. Beautiful park! Old woman bay is beautiful. Nokomis trail is very steep with challenging rocks but worth it. The Agawa Pictographs area must! But be careful because it can be very slippery. Awesome Fall Foliage!  The Agawa Rock Petroglyph is part of the Lake Superior Provincial Park The park is great, beautiful and the park office manger Bob Elliott is very informative. Love the park. This is a really beautiful trip but there is no place to stop and take photos or even slow down. It is very well maintained park and also one of the largest clear water lake. Staff is very helpful. Nice views from hiking trail lookouts, Agawa Bay campground gives a pebble/sand beach experience. Nature at its finest. Backcountry galore to visit, friendly staff at the office. This isn't Disney Land folks it is the real deal, bring hiking boots, a kayak and a sense of adventure, and don't forget the bear bag, they don't need your food. Beautiful part of the country,  breathtaking views and the sunset over lake superior is incredible. Very little privacy and electrical connections can be very far, still a beautiful place.

Best place to hike and swim.. alot of black flies though... Great view but compares to other Ontario park I have been, not the most friendly one. Decide to cut my trip short.

We could book our site, as it was after Labour Day, so when we arrived around 5:30pm, we had to do some searching for a ... Stunning views. This drive should be on everyone's bucket list. Agawa Bay is my favourite beach in Ontario, even though it is rock covered. The many hiking trails and pristine waters are worth revisiting year after year. The campground is clean, and well maintained. This park is worth the long drive from the GTA. Beautiful views!  We were somewhat disappointed as many of the picnic parks do not easily accomodate big rigs? Very special place. Stunning Great hiking trails A favourite Ontario Provincial Park. great cMping spot Sky or lake? 2 become one...so cool! Loved it.. was here back in the 70's and brought my kids and fell in love with canada.. Arrived just before dusk at Rabbit Blanket Lake.  Ugh... facilities were like stepping waaay.... back in time. Bathroom was a brown painted box with a hole in the ground. Not a fan of non-flush out houses. 

Cold, brown high iron water ... The most beautiful place! super friendly, very helpful Should be rated one of the best Good fishing or picnic area Best park ever. AMAZING park! Some of the most beautiful and rugged landscape you can find. Very hilly, great hiking, and beautiful views of Lake Superior and several waterfalls.

However be careful of being too loud. Old farts will report you if you have any fun. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. But I really wish that our bag of firewood had not been stolen while we were away from our camp site at Rabbit Blanket.  Stunning scenery. Awesome place to wind-up Wow, it's amazing view is breathtaking!! Go there if you ever get a chance!! Hiking, canoeing, and kayaking the Algoma high lands and the shores of Lake Superior.

Plenty of activities. Breath taking. Would go back in a heartbeat. The drive is long, but so worth it. If you haven't been to the this part of Ontario, you are missing out. Don't count on the water being warm. We went the second week of August and being the true Canadians that we are, it was quite (shall we say) refreshing. Surprisingly beautiful park just hours north of Sault Ste. Marie. The park has a headquarters with bathroom facilities but is mostly primitive. There is some hiking, canoeing, and several from-the-car strolls. No food except up in Wawa. We had a great spot with the lake right in front of us! There was lots to do and see! Showers and bathrooms and laundry facilities. Power hook up was a bit far but we had plenty of cord. The sound of the waves was incredible! A thunder ... I love this place. Definitely want to buy property in this area someday.  I wish my family had not immigrated to Wisconsin! I love Canada! Nice campground. Bit isolated though. An hour to Wawa for shops.

Drove past the park in fall. Amazing scenery and twists. The lake and mountain combination on road is mesmerizing. Lake Superior Provincial Park,  Agawa campground is amazing. 
The coastal drive to get there is breathtaking. I tented, but you can easily rent a cabin or lodge along the way. 
The flora and fauna is very different from Southern Ontario. ... I visited the park a few years ago. This park is awesome! Everything is bigger in this region. We had a great time from camping at Gargantua Bay to hiking the Sand River and even bushwhacking to a campsite that was not used in years. 

If it was not so far from Toronto I would visit more often. It's on Lake Superior. It's beautiful. The park offers many trails. Both campgrounds are amazing. All the staff we've dealt with are excellent. I mean it's on Lake Superior...what more do you need !!!! This part of Ontario is gorgeous. The lake is shimmering from the Ontario side.

Very hard to fit trailers into many sites they ... Beautiful scenery, plenty of trails, lookouts and campsites. Trails we visited were physically demanding.

Park facility needs to improve including washroom cleanliness. Nice trails with great views of superior lake itself , great view in the larger campground with clean and new showers butvery old comfort station in the smaller campground Awesome hiking along the north shore. Rent a canoe and go to Miji lakefor a couple of days.
Great camp sites interior, beaches all to yourself. Stayed there 2 nights. I remember camping there back in the 60's with family and climbing the rocks and swimming in the Cold Lake. Great place to be on the beach at sunset. It took me about 14 hours to even reach here but it was worth every single second. What a well preserved place. With clean facilities and friendly staff, it is an absolute must-see bucket list worthy experience. The lake itself... Stunning. This park was very splendid and the scenery was bewitching. Beautiful park! Old woman bay is beautiful. Nokomis trail is very steep with challenging rocks but worth it. The Agawa Pictographs area must! But be careful because it can be very slippery.

Nice views from hiking trail lookouts, Agawa Bay campground gives a pebble/sand beach experience. Nature at its finest. Backcountry galore to visit, friendly staff at the office.

Beautiful part of the country,  breathtaking views and the sunset over lake superior is incredible. Very little privacy and electrical connections can be very far, still a beautiful place.

Best place to hike and swim.. alot of black flies though... Great view but compares to other Ontario park I have been, not the most friendly one. Decide to cut my trip short. Hands down the most beautiful Provincial Park I ever camped at and one of the most beautiful sites in all of Ontario that I've experienced. Just stunning. Had an incredible camp site close to the lake - and the stars at night were ... Nice campground with spots on the beach but also some that back onto the highway (can be noisy) Beautiful park.

We could book our site, as it was after Labour Day, so when we arrived around 5:30pm, we had to do some searching for a ... Stunning views. This drive should be on everyone's bucket list. Agawa Bay is my favourite beach in Ontario, even though it is rock covered. The many hiking trails and pristine waters are worth revisiting year after year. The campground is clean, and well maintained. This park is worth the long drive from the GTA. Beautiful views!  We were somewhat disappointed as many of the picnic parks do not easily accomodate big rigs? Very special place. Stunning Great hiking trails A favourite Ontario Provincial Park. great cMping spot Sky or lake? 2 become one...so cool! Loved it.. was here back in the 70's and brought my kids and fell in love with canada.. Arrived just before dusk at Rabbit Blanket Lake.  Ugh... facilities were like stepping waaay.... back in time.

Cold, brown high iron water ... The most beautiful place! super friendly, very helpful Should be rated one of the best Good fishing or picnic area Best park ever. AMAZING park! Some of the most beautiful and rugged landscape you can find. Very hilly, great hiking, and beautiful views of Lake Superior and several waterfalls.

Love it. Beautiful! Sucked that there was no cell service way out there but it was still a lovely beach none the less! And they had a side for the dogs too which was great! My pup absolutely loved his big swim there last summer! My husband and I love taking our 3 children to Long Point.  It's so beautiful!!!!!

Thanks Lord for aloud us to enjoy your own creation 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Long point has a nice Long Beach, easy to get your own spot away from other people. Beach water temperature is warm. It’s all sands. No rocks .Perfect for smaller kids and dogs. Campsites are great especially the ones close to the beach. ... I particularly want to review the ""Dogs Allowed"" section of Long Point Provincial Park.   We've often been to the ""normal"" beach, but after acquiring a couple of dogs in the last two years, we wanted to include them in our annual ""Beach ... Went to the beach for the day. I couldn't find pricing information ahead of time, but for two adults, it was $14.50 which wasn't too bad. There were people parking outside of the park along the main street and entering the beach via ... Went in July 2018 and the water had too much debris for my liking. It took forever to find parking and then the beach itself had way too many people. Would not go back here. Like any provincial park, well maintained with friendly staff.  Rates are, however, getting a little high for camping. 

We stayed at the Monarch and Firefly area.  Amazing site if you have kids.  Very close walk to the gorgeous beach, ... Almost the perfect beach.  Decent fine sand and shallows forever.  Nice and warm water, great for the kids. The only problem is the bugs. The side of the point facing inland is a marsh, which means huge breeding ground. It's hard to ... The beach is fantastic! Tons of sand and great for the kids since it's shallow for quite a distance.  Unfortunately the mosquitoes were terrible when we went in mod July.  Luckily we found a device in Port Rowan to help with the mosquitoes at night so we could still enjoy our campfires!  We will definitely go back again! Long, clean, sandy beaches great for families. We were there on a Monday and it was so VERY much nicer than Port Dover where the party crowd had taken over with loud music, booze and smoking YUK!  Had a peaceful day of fun and sun, water was beautiful.  Worth the entrance fee. Great experience and historical place. So much I didn't know until you visit and read. And by far the best beach in South Western Ontario. Here's a little hint don't climb up the 50 foot sand dunes there are Pathways that get you to the beach LOL Nice beach all sand and miles of space to spread out dor your own peace of sunshine. Park is clean and well looked after. Worth the day trip and picnic with the family. Dog beach also here and the sand is easy on your pups tender feet. This was a amazing place to camp. Washrooms and showers were free and clean. The lake is a bit cold but the waves were fun. Lots of sites have paths straight to the beach, Lake Erie. Overall awesome place to camp, I would definitely recommend this park for future campers! Awesome beach and quiet long.  Early you go, you get better parking.  Get your own food, water was warm enough on a day like 35°C. Your own tent, beach umbrella or canopy would be very helpful.  Lots of cottages and RV park.  About 2 hrs driving from Toronto. Multiple route options before you hit hwy 6. What a wonderful beach! Must be the best in Ontario. Sand is nice and soft and no smell... also very quiet and always a nice breeze. Great beaches close to the campsite. Sites are a little smaller - however are well maintained and the access to the beach is worth it! Very popular campground for families. was a great holiday. love to go back with a trailer. and my lovely family Lots of fun. Well organized camp sites with comfort stations providing showers,laundry, washrooms. Very clean. Quick beach access points. Beach is very clean. Does have a dog beach as well. Want a Californian beach vacation in Ontario? Come camp on the beach dunes at Long Point. This is a quiet family type provincial park, not a lot of noisy parties, except maybe on Friday 13th (45 min from Port Dover).
The weather here ... Visit the park in early August. Beach is long and sandy, but you need to step out far before overcoming the shallow water to swim. It is like giant wading pool for kids to enjoy. There are lots of green beach mosquito ready to stink your ... Very beautiful in the morning at sunrise, picnic benches for meals, and nice refreshing water. The best waters - wide and long beaches, plenty  room for all. Designated Dog beach @ P2. If you need a Park bench go early. Avoid Grass n grown areas for ticks, Propane BBQ allowed.- Travel light, Wheeled trolleys wont spin u will end ... Great long stretch of sandy Beach.  Plenty of space and parking.  Washrooms and water to clean off with.  Best to come on a weekday as it can get packed with people.  Bring an umbrella or tent as it will get hot.  Water is Sandy and shallow. We come here every year.  The beach is amazing!  Kids love playing in the sand and swimming in the water.  Washrooms are close by.  They can get busy and super dirty at times...this year they were very clean - quite impressed!
Water can ... Beautiful park and many sites are in sand dunes. Well kept and friendly staff. Sites are not private and quiet but the beautiful beach and distant to make up for it The beach is very nice, it's similar to Sandbanks - fine grains and dunes albeit smaller. Decent campsites. Overall great park. Went there expecting an isolated area with trails, lots of trees and your basic camping experience. But it is home to hundreds of locals, people with cottages, etc. Not very private, not much to do besides go to the beach. Our campground was all sand too, so that was fun. Great place for camping and swiming one of the best places to go for swimming and camping in the sandy areas Great park. I'd definitely recommend Monarch or Turtle Dunes sites over Firefly as Firefly looked to be like a parking lot. The showers between Monarch and Firefly can also get quite busy. The beach is wonderful and the dog beach portion is a good size. Our favourite Southern Ontario Beach. The park has such a huge beach and you can walk so kilometres. Last year the water was extremely high up so there was less sand so less space but that was still ok. The water is always warm and clear on sunny warm days. The sunsets are beautiful 😊 Amazing beach. Some campsites are really sandy. Most have good privacy. Good family camping spot. Beach is beautiful! Can't say it enough.  But lack of garbage drop points make it easy for ""some people"" to leave their garbage behind. (So annoying)  Lots of parking! ...and lots of bugs at night. Great place for a family trip, go to the beach, park, or even put the boat out on the water. Amazing place! So disappointed. I have difficulty walking an not being able to get to the beach with it climbing and dunes was very disappointing. Spent many childhood memories in Long Point. Coming into the point is now a private beach.. Really.. The only flat spot to get to water.. Sorry.. Won't be back 😕😕 Went camping and went to the beach. Good prices and nicely put together. Not sure if this was just from the hot sun or if it’s always like this but the sand was super hot and felt like my feet were burning. Sites are a bit small and not very private but the gorgeous beach makes up for that. Well worth a weekend visit. Excellent park, first time visiting. Very clean sandy beaches. Shallow water great for kids. I'll be sure to visit this beach a few times this summer. The kids loved it. One of my favourite beaches! Very good for swimming! Me and my kids love it there! Stunning beach. Soft sand no rocks /pebble. Very clean and family oriented. Loved itt Location is great, summer staff are superb.  However the off season staff are rude, bossy and tell off people who are birding or photographing the region. Awesome I love this beach lonngggg and very windy most days. What an amazing day at the beach. If you did not know where you were. You'd feel like your at the ocean. Going off season on a weekday is awesome, there could not have been more than 50 people the whole stretch of beach!  There was quite a bit of debris from the winter they had not cleared yet but for the most part the beach was clear.  Saw one brave soul in the water, way too cold for a dip for me... I really enjoyed my stay
We were quite concerned because so many mentioned the tick presence... there are also tons of signs everywhere. We decided to be very attentive, avoided all grass and greens. Maybe we were excessive, but then we ... Nice provincial park.  They have a dog section.  Gets busy in the summer so come early if you eant a nice spot to camp for the day.  The cost to enter is 14.00 I love it here, always feel like I’m in another part of the world with the white sandy beaches. Only Downside is the ticks were bad this year so be careful with your pets. Nice beach, shame about the mosquitoes! The absolute worst mosquitoes I’ve ever experienced. So bad that you cannot be out after dark. You can shower in bug spray, burn the candles, it doesn’t matter, you’ll be swarmed by mosquitoes. Bug ... Very quiet in the fall. The beach is as beautiful as ever! My favorite Prov. Park. We have been come here with my BFs since we were 10 years old. Over 40 years and we try to come back every year.  Best Beach! Hot water shower with dog beach and fishing point outside of the park. The food inside the park is cheaper than freshco A glamping experience that is sure to be rewarding for the whole family. Ample sites spaced far apart. Tennants are generally courteous with most noisy sites completely quiet by 11:00.

Convenience stations are well situated, clean, and ... Had a great time there. Beach was awesome. Bugs were a little much at points at campground. But overall great time. Would be back for sure. Nice sandy campsite steps away from the beach. Pretty calm quiet, waves were strong and water pretty shallow until you get out far. Site is very sandy so be prepared to get sand in everything. We went in late August had bug spray didnt ... I did not like this place, swim area at 350 Erie Blvd, one of the poorly managed provincial park. Tons of mosquitos, water quality not that good. The worst thing of this place is the parking. They took cad14.5 as parking fee, paid cash ... Great quite beach.   Beutifull sand.  Family frendly.  It is not crammed with touristy shops.  Beutiful view We loved camping long point. We have camped there few times. The beach is long and it's great for walking. A Beautiful place to camp. The beach is amazing and the point main strip has everything you need for a great summer vacation Nice clean park.  Lots of poison ivy and be careful of ticks. They charge 14 dollars entrance fee but do not provide lifeguard on the beaches. Why would you drive hours to a paid beach with no lifeguards if Toronto has such a beautiful beach as Woodbine beach.. Had a washroom, long beach and good water.  No shade though Popular summer spot in the Norfolk and Oxford county area. Generations have visited the shores of Lake Erie here each summer. The name is very appropriate. It's a very long beach. Beautiful scenery. Hidden gem of a beach, not crowded the water is clean, beautiful sand and relaxing atmosphere. No food places close to the area so drinks and picnic food is necessary. The best kept secret! This park feels like you're in Florida or some cute cottage village! This is a nice beautiful sandy each very good for family's with kids. WARNING: AVOID THIS PROVINCIAL PARK AT ALL COSTS. It is a beautiful park, but do yourself a major favour: Go to the public beach access points instead. Very poorly managed provincial park, and the ostensibly nepotistic staff have proven ... Beautiful area but the ticks are unbelievable.. Found a few on the dog, husband, myself and many around the campsite..Got home and found another one embedded in my husbands chest and we were all covered in deet all weekend as well. Unfortunately it's enough to keep us away! Park is nice and beautiful 
Nice place for family picnic 
Huge kids playground...kids will have great fun 
Water in the lake is not clean tho.. -2 stars because of it small park, a long Beach, not ideal for kayaking or canoe as there are too many moter boat... Good for fishing and saw many people are cleaning fish near the boat launch area Wonderful place for kayaking, and beach is delightful. I been in many  places  but long point  is really  nice   place     I would   go   every time  I have the chance Beautiful area in general. Absolutely love it. Especially the beach! Great park and beach. Probably going to try a few days camping there. Fantastic grounds and facilities! Enjoy the beach and camping within driving distance from local eateries and stores. Best park !!! We camped there for Aug long weekend, water was warm and beaches are clean Beautiful scene.  Sandy beach. Family (kids and dogs) loved it. The best park in Ontario, wish I could give it 10 stars Love the place. Glad we were able to bring our dog Decent beach. Sand is more of a black or darker sand so it gets very hot on a sunny day. Usually not overly crowded. Excellent beach natural surroundings with a nice camp ground but close enough for a day trip for those living in southern Ontario We have been many times. I do enjoy all long point has to offer. FYI campsites on sand which takes getting use to. Love this beach.  Clean.  Needs a few more picnic tables Long Point Provincial Park is favourite spot for myself and many of my friends. Camping here was a great experience. The beach is long and some sites are so close to the beach it makes for a very carefree and enjoyable time. The comfort ... Gorgeous beaxh, however waves can be gigantic. Not kid friendly Nice and clean water. Not too deep. But no lifeguards Do not come here and save your money. It’s 14! Dollars just to get in to be eaten by black flys and worry about ticks not only is there massive sand dunes it’s quite a walk just to get to the beach so it’s not disablilty friendly either, ... Amazing place to go camping! Loved camping right beside the beach. Would have liked a bit more space between campsites though, you're basically camping with the people beside you. Long Point can be seen from space and is worth visiting on Earth Great time every time I visit Nice park and beach to enjoy spend a day you can have BBQ there and beach is nice A must go to place. Cleanliness  alone makes it a 5 star location. A very good area for swimming and picnic Busy when the weather is nice! Come early if you want to find a parking and the shade. I've only experience the boat launch that is less than a kilo from the front gate... could be cheaper for those of us just using the boat launch and not the rest of the park.. My favourite beach in Ontario. Very clean and there is tons of space even when it is busy. The beach is good but there is no park or BBQ area for family picnic. Amazing long sandy shallow beach! Came at peak timenonba major holiday and still found parking not too far away from the beach. The dog didnt like the water much but thats his issue not the beach and i loved it! Be aware that ticks are a thing down that way so chickity check yo self bruv! Unique park, great for kids and beach fun and bird watching Actually went to the beach, the beach is lovely, a nice place to walk and spend a sunny afternoon. Awesome time. $14.50 per car for the day A bunch of mosquitoes and tiny camping lots. I don't recommend camping here Beautiful beach, quaint snack bar and store. Camping at Long Point has become an annual tradition for us. We always enjoy our stay, park and facilities are clean and staff is friendly. Great place to swim or just hang out on the beach Long Point is a great place to get away from daily life.  Once you drive onto the causeway the sights and sounds of wildlife, the waves hitting the beach and the quietness of this world biosphere makes you feel like you have travelled to a remote place.  If you have been there you will understand! Full of mosquitoes, I mean literally. It is an extremely beautiful place with a long sandy beach however flies and mosquitoes make it impossible to enjoy this place. Great beach & family friendly camp ground Book your day in advance. Gets busy Lovely beach nice place to go to! Love absolutely everything but the poison ivy. After 1.5 hour drive, followed by a 1 hour line up for entrance... we were turned away as the park was full.  

I heard of similar years ago.  Thought we'd try it with our family all the same.  Mistake. Very clean park and the staff very helpful and friendly This place had been on my radar for quite some time. There's so much to do in the area, from boat tours to camping, to tree top canopy tours and zip lining. The whole coast is intriguing, but I really appreciate the provincial park, the ... Great yellow sanded beach.  Feels like a Carribean beach.  Dog friendly areas.  Cottages to rent.  Peaceful and not overbuilt like Wasaga or Sable beaches. Always good to hit the beach clean and dog friendly One of my favourite places to car camp. Friendly staff, nice clean sites in both Cottonwood (old park) and the other sites. Sites closer to the beach are in sand, a nice change from the rock and dirt. Be aware  that the closer you get to ... Love the beach here. We love Long Point Provincial Park! We discovered this beach a few years ago and have come several times a year since. The beach is nice and the water is usually clear. It doesn't get overly busy like some other provincial parks and the ... Its worth it if you love the beach but there are no trails to explore..but the huge sandy dune hills are neat to see! And the wetlands which are a natural biosphere.. If your into bird watching I'd say this is a great place for that. Went on long weekend ... 1-1/2 hours to travel the 8 km to the gate only to find that it could be another 30 mins to park and a 2 km walk to the beach ... We turned around and left ... It took 7 mins to exit and there was an 8 km long ... Nice walking place First time here and loved it. Will have to come back here to try out the camp grounds. Beach is sandy, clean and shallow for a long stretch which was great for the kids. There was even an area where the water was ""trapped"" in so the ... Water is very nice and and the beach is nice and long and shallow Great place to get away from the daily GTA commotion. Very good sand, no small stones which is anoing. Great beach, very family friendly, and very helpful staff. Add that to the natural beauty and it was a great day trip. If you arrive after 11AM on the weekend parking can get full and the park rangers will open an overflow area that is a long walk from the beach. Great time overall. We camped in the turtle dunes section right near the washroom. Mosquitoes were awful!!! Plus constant traffic to the washroom. I was shocked at how many people drove to washrooms/showers and it never ends all day! ... Beautiful park been going several years...just a bad experience this year....staff very helpful...got a refund for nights not staying... Nice  location with long beautiful beaches and a extensive Wetland to canoe and kayak around. Lots of fishing available. Went down for camping last weekend and can't believe I haven't visited long point sooner. The beaches were awesome and the night sky was unreal! The dog beach we visited was actually really nice and the water is quite shallow there which ... The water is so amazing, warm and clean Beautiful at day time but mosquitoes are savage at night time. Terrible place. Tonns of ins insects and no shade. Nice place to visit in summer.....the road to this place is also nice Great place to visit in the summer.. Hot Sand but nice Beach Amazing. Great swimming! The best beach in southern Ontario Water level up very high. Alot of trees down in the water Beautiful beach and great for camping. Best place to spend time on Lake. Great place for cottage or camp. Beach is nice  and clean. Great Sandy Beach.

It was a good cam out really enjoyed being out there I'm going to miss it cuz I'm probably going to need to go back out this year coming A quaint area with many cottages on thin peninsula extending south into Lake Erie in southern Ontario. There are several  boat launches on the eastern side of the point ( the inner bay) . On the west side of the point  the beach ... This is the second time our family has camped here and we absolutley loved it. One of the greatest beaches. Campsites close to the water are also private and sandy. Overall a great experience.

Very beautiful place!  the beach is gorgeous and the send is very nice to play with. 
The campsite is with sand which make it comfortable to put a tent on. Beach campsite have enough space for two cars and three big tents.
the cons about ... A very nice place to visit. By far my favourite dog park Save your money & don’t go there. It needs a lot of improvements Great gateway to relaxation Amazing place with great swimming The best beach in Ontario Wounderful place to visit Great beach. Good swimming. And dogs are welcome on the beach. Hard to find convenient parking so go early or just be patient. A spot will come up. Not happy a storm was coming in the next morning and they never gave us on a heads up that all the front campsites are going to flood so we woke up to 4 inches water on the whole campsite worst campsites ever and when I compliant they didn't care what's so ever worst provincial park ever and I been to alot Beautiful beach and well maintained. Service stations are clean. Family friendly and plenty of sand to do a picnic. Check check check all your stuff when you get home for TICKS!! we found 3 one on my wife and 2 crawling on our stuff we packed with us... Maybe a little early in the season.. To cold to have a shower..doors let cold air in, in the shower cubes. May 24 to iffy. Had a blast here. Great sites and a nice beach area to run the dogs off leash. There is a little store in case you forget anything and everyone seems very kind. Annual go to place... tried cotton wood and turtle dunes both awesome. Turtle dunes is NOT radio free... heard some music over the weekend, nothing out of place, still respect full Great place for everyone. Visited with my family for the day.

Tight roads and some spots poorly laid out for larger RVs but the beach and vibe make up for it! The dog beach is the best around! We stayed in the new campground. Comfort stations and showers were clean. Definitely going again! As far as I know, not many people know about the Long point provincial park or it's beaches. Which is why, I think, this place is still so natural and beautiful.

We went there on a Saturday afternoon just out of curiosity and found the ... One of the best beaches in Ontario like it, good place for camping. I had so much fun swimming here!! Great camping spot as well. Could use some asphalt fixing to fix the rough roads Great beach! The sand bars keep the water from getting too deep and cold and create the best waves for playing in!

An amazing park with some of the best beach in the country. We love longpoint. We just went last weekend. The only negative thing this time was the insane amount of mosquitos. They need to bring some bats in or something. I was blown away by the amount. From 6:30 in the morning till about 9:30/10 at night they are crazy.  Nice beach , easy access, ample ,clean Great provincial park.. Could be better if bathrooms were cleaner and or deodorized One of the best places to camp. Period.

Although the water may be absolutely freezing, it is ... Nice Beaches and warm water Great time Always good. Best beach in Ontario. Southern exposure I love going to the beach there! There's a lot of parking, the sand is super clean. The dog beach has a lot of cute doggies playing fetch and seeing in the water. The water is not super warm but it's Ontario and the sand dunes make you feel safer. Amazing beach I usually go early may and beat all the bugs but great place for bird watching and lots of near by towns to explore.  Great beach 👌 Relaxing Amazing soft sand beaches. Seems like Long Point is a really well kept secret Beautiful, peaceful beach. Best beach in Ontario The road trip going there was nice, however when getting there first thing realized is way too many flies. Way too many, seriously. I think it has something to do with the weed that grows all over the place.  Camping in the dunes can mean mosquitos are brutal if it rains. Main washrooms are great, lots of showers too. Privys are a seat with a hole, not the step on flush kind. Beach is wide, park was at capacity and still room on the beach. ... My family (wife plus 9&6 year old boys) just spent a night here. We had a pretty good site that was near the beach and was spacious. Privacy in all the sites is not great from what I could see. Bathrooms were clean. Not enough garbage ... Beautiful place to camp overall beach is fine, but the beach was full of debris.  Paid 14.50 to get in should at least have the beach cleaned.  It was full of broken sticks and  some kids got hurt running around. Beautiful sandy beach by the lake, perfect place to day picnic and camping. Only two hours drive from Toronto.  Awesome place to have a family BBQ.Then go take a swim.. if you are the overnight camping type you can do that too..  So close to the beach which was lovely and clean but the sites are smallish and it was a little noisier than what we like but not bad.  The is our favourite place to swim and camp. Lake Erie has crystal clear waters and Long Point has white sandy beaches that stretch for miles.  Beautiful location. We didn't choose the best site (306 monarch with no shade) but for myself, my 3yr old and pregnant wife it was a wonderful time. 
No issues with ticks although mosquitos were bad at dusk for an hour or so. Short walk to the beach and facilities were very clean and close by. Best beach in my area live it good waves Clea.

On top of that, the sand was too dirty, hence, so was the water. So worth the drive to enjoy lovely water and beach Nice beach to spend hot summer days! Beautiful beaches and natural, unspoiled scenery. Inhabited part of the island can get pretty touristy during the summer and holidays, but still lots of fun. Hopefully these good people who live there will never ""sell out"". sand is smooth, long stretched beach, the view was great. the weather was cold though Excellent park Awesome beach The beach! The peace! The great family times !  Great very good summer vacation desitation Great beach! Longest beach on Lake Erie. Camping within walking distance from the beach. Great area to be Beach area was gorgeous and the waves were fun! The only thing was the tide creeped up slowly over time and we had to move our station halfway through the day. They had clean changing stations and washrooms and was such a unique and scenic drive to the beach too!  A Great place to fish Beautiful beach with lots of good restaurants nearby Great place for kayaking and nature watching Needles in the sand One of the best beaches in southern Ontario. Pro - very clean nice fresh breeze.  Con - keep your kids close while swimming there is potential for strong undertows  Nice park, very nice beach, the facilities (washrooms)are older.

Not over crowded  One of the very best beaches in the area!  Warm water, gradual beach, shallow water nearby eats and snacks We go here for the beaches which tend to be less crowded, cleaner and better groomed. The water entry is also shallow for a long while which some people appreciate. Sand is too hot can't walk without sandles. Lots of area to setup tents. Nice parking space. But too many mosquitoes. Beach, camping, hiking, this place is a well maintained area 2 hours drive from Toronto. The beach was clean and has a pretty long shoreline.  Fantastic campground book well in advance though Great beaches and super areas on the beach for dogs. Wildlife area is special too.

Some of the worst mosquitoes I've encountered and tick central  Port Rowan is a great place to go when you are in Long Point. Nice beaches Not the best facilities, lots of black flies on the beach and whiney campers complaining about everything. The drive is just about 2 hours from West GTA  ,  but the countryside  drive makes you feel like an actual getaway.  Don't miss Ice Cream  at Twins  Great family place! Beautiful and well kept. Having a waterfowl hunting area so close is unsettling though My family have been going camping at longpoint for years its the best place in norfolk for privacy and quiet family camping.

No way to swim! long point is my favorite southern Ontario beach. big area not crowded One of the best beaches in Ontario Horrible staff, one washroom for the whole campground. They say that you can't wash your dishes anywhere so what do they expect us to do? In Europe they have dishwashing stations in the campground. Also our site was missing a picnic table and it took forever to get a new one. Also it is a lime disease endemic spot.  Great beach. Great off-leash section for dogs too! site #359, family of 4 (kids are 5 & 3)

Located within a designated World Biosphere ReserveAmazing beach. You would honestly forget that you were in Ontario. White sands and crystal clear, warm and shallow waters.

Love it. Beautiful! Sucked that there was no cell service way out there but it was still a lovely beach none the less! And they had a side for the dogs too which was great! My pup absolutely loved his big swim there last summer! My husband and I love taking our 3 children to Long Point.  It's so beautiful!!!!! They have a dog beach if you love bringing your furry loved one along !! It's so peaceful and clean ! Amazing family time connecting with GOD our CREATOR... Thanks Lord for aloud us to enjoy your own creation 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Long point has a nice Long Beach, easy to get your own spot away from other people. Beach water temperature is warm. It’s all sands. No rocks .Perfect for smaller kids and dogs. Campsites are great especially the ones close to the beach. ... I particularly want to review the ""Dogs Allowed"" section of Long Point Provincial Park.   We've often been to the ""normal"" beach, but after acquiring a couple of dogs in the last two years, we wanted to include them in our annual ""Beach ... Went to the beach for the day. I couldn't find pricing information ahead of time, but for two adults, it was $14.50 which wasn't too bad. There were people parking outside of the park along the main street and entering the beach via ... Went in July 2018 and the water had too much debris for my liking. It took forever to find parking and then the beach itself had way too many people. Would not go back here. Like any provincial park, well maintained with friendly staff.  Rates are, however, getting a little high for camping. 

We stayed at the Monarch and Firefly area.  Amazing site if you have kids.  Very close walk to the gorgeous beach, ... Almost the perfect beach.  Decent fine sand and shallows forever.  Nice and warm water, great for the kids. The only problem is the bugs. The side of the point facing inland is a marsh, which means huge breeding ground. It's hard to ... The beach is fantastic! Tons of sand and great for the kids since it's shallow for quite a distance.  Unfortunately the mosquitoes were terrible when we went in mod July.  Luckily we found a device in Port Rowan to help with the mosquitoes at night so we could still enjoy our campfires!  We will definitely go back again! Long, clean, sandy beaches great for families. We were there on a Monday and it was so VERY much nicer than Port Dover where the party crowd had taken over with loud music, booze and smoking YUK!  Had a peaceful day of fun and sun, water was beautiful.  Worth the entrance fee. Great experience and historical place. So much I didn't know until you visit and read. And by far the best beach in South Western Ontario. Here's a little hint don't climb up the 50 foot sand dunes there are Pathways that get you to the beach LOL Nice beach all sand and miles of space to spread out dor your own peace of sunshine. Park is clean and well looked after. Worth the day trip and picnic with the family. Dog beach also here and the sand is easy on your pups tender feet. This was a amazing place to camp. Washrooms and showers were free and clean. The lake is a bit cold but the waves were fun. Lots of sites have paths straight to the beach, Lake Erie. Overall awesome place to camp, I would definitely recommend this park for future campers! Awesome beach and quiet long.  Early you go, you get better parking.  Get your own food, water was warm enough on a day like 35°C. Your own tent, beach umbrella or canopy would be very helpful.  Lots of cottages and RV park.  About 2 hrs driving from Toronto. Multiple route options before you hit hwy 6. What a wonderful beach! Must be the best in Ontario. Sand is nice and soft and no smell... also very quiet and always a nice breeze. Great beaches close to the campsite. Sites are a little smaller - however are well maintained and the access to the beach is worth it! Very popular campground for families. was a great holiday. love to go back with a trailer. and my lovely family Lots of fun. Well organized camp sites with comfort stations providing showers,laundry, washrooms. Very clean. Quick beach access points. Beach is very clean. Does have a dog beach as well. Want a Californian beach vacation in Ontario? Come camp on the beach dunes at Long Point. This is a quiet family type provincial park, not a lot of noisy parties, except maybe on Friday 13th (45 min from Port Dover).
The weather here ... Visit the park in early August. Beach is long and sandy, but you need to step out far before overcoming the shallow water to swim. It is like giant wading pool for kids to enjoy. There are lots of green beach mosquito ready to stink your ... Very beautiful in the morning at sunrise, picnic benches for meals, and nice refreshing water. The best waters - wide and long beaches, plenty  room for all. Designated Dog beach @ P2. If you need a Park bench go early. Avoid Grass n grown areas for ticks, Propane BBQ allowed.- Travel light, Wheeled trolleys wont spin u will end ... Great long stretch of sandy Beach.  Plenty of space and parking.  Washrooms and water to clean off with.  Best to come on a weekday as it can get packed with people.  Bring an umbrella or tent as it will get hot.  Water is Sandy and shallow. We come here every year.  The beach is amazing!  Kids love playing in the sand and swimming in the water.  Washrooms are close by.  They can get busy and super dirty at times...this year they were very clean - quite impressed!
Water can ... Beautiful park and many sites are in sand dunes. Well kept and friendly staff. Sites are not private and quiet but the beautiful beach and distant to make up for it The beach is very nice, it's similar to Sandbanks - fine grains and dunes albeit smaller. Decent campsites. Overall great park. Went there expecting an isolated area with trails, lots of trees and your basic camping experience. But it is home to hundreds of locals, people with cottages, etc. Not very private, not much to do besides go to the beach. Our campground was all sand too, so that was fun. Great place for camping and swiming one of the best places to go for swimming and camping in the sandy areas Great park. I'd definitely recommend Monarch or Turtle Dunes sites over Firefly as Firefly looked to be like a parking lot. The showers between Monarch and Firefly can also get quite busy. The beach is wonderful and the dog beach portion is a good size. Our favourite Southern Ontario Beach. The park has such a huge beach and you can walk so kilometres. Last year the water was extremely high up so there was less sand so less space but that was still ok. The water is always warm and clear on sunny warm days. The sunsets are beautiful 😊 Amazing beach. Some campsites are really sandy. Most have good privacy. Good family camping spot. Beach is beautiful! Can't say it enough.  But lack of garbage drop points make it easy for ""some people"" to leave their garbage behind. (So annoying)  Lots of parking! ...and lots of bugs at night. Great place for a family trip, go to the beach, park, or even put the boat out on the water. Amazing place! So disappointed. I have difficulty walking an not being able to get to the beach with it climbing and dunes was very disappointing. Spent many childhood memories in Long Point. Coming into the point is now a private beach.. Really.. The only flat spot to get to water.. Sorry.. Won't be back 😕😕 Went camping and went to the beach. Good prices and nicely put together. Not sure if this was just from the hot sun or if it’s always like this but the sand was super hot and felt like my feet were burning. Sites are a bit small and not very private but the gorgeous beach makes up for that. Well worth a weekend visit. Excellent park, first time visiting. Very clean sandy beaches. Shallow water great for kids. I'll be sure to visit this beach a few times this summer. The kids loved it. One of my favourite beaches! Very good for swimming! Me and my kids love it there! Stunning beach. Soft sand no rocks /pebble. Very clean and family oriented. Loved itt Location is great, summer staff are superb.  However the off season staff are rude, bossy and tell off people who are birding or photographing the region. Awesome I love this beach lonngggg and very windy most days. What an amazing day at the beach. If you did not know where you were. You'd feel like your at the ocean. Going off season on a weekday is awesome, there could not have been more than 50 people the whole stretch of beach!  There was quite a bit of debris from the winter they had not cleared yet but for the most part the beach was clear.  Saw one brave soul in the water, way too cold for a dip for me... I really enjoyed my stay
We were quite concerned because so many mentioned the tick presence... there are also tons of signs everywhere. We decided to be very attentive, avoided all grass and greens. Maybe we were excessive, but then we ... Nice provincial park.  They have a dog section.  Gets busy in the summer so come early if you eant a nice spot to camp for the day.  The cost to enter is 14.00 I love it here, always feel like I’m in another part of the world with the white sandy beaches. Only Downside is the ticks were bad this year so be careful with your pets. Nice beach, shame about the mosquitoes! The absolute worst mosquitoes I’ve ever experienced. So bad that you cannot be out after dark. You can shower in bug spray, burn the candles, it doesn’t matter, you’ll be swarmed by mosquitoes. Bug ... Very quiet in the fall. The beach is as beautiful as ever! My favorite Prov. Park. We have been come here with my BFs since we were 10 years old. Over 40 years and we try to come back every year.  Best Beach! Hot water shower with dog beach and fishing point outside of the park. The food inside the park is cheaper than freshco A glamping experience that is sure to be rewarding for the whole family. Ample sites spaced far apart. Tennants are generally courteous with most noisy sites completely quiet by 11:00.

Convenience stations are well situated, clean, and ... Had a great time there. Beach was awesome. Bugs were a little much at points at campground. But overall great time. Would be back for sure. Nice sandy campsite steps away from the beach. Pretty calm quiet, waves were strong and water pretty shallow until you get out far. Site is very sandy so be prepared to get sand in everything. We went in late August had bug spray didnt ... I did not like this place, swim area at 350 Erie Blvd, one of the poorly managed provincial park. Tons of mosquitos, water quality not that good. The worst thing of this place is the parking. They took cad14.5 as parking fee, paid cash ... Great quite beach.   Beutifull sand.  Family frendly.  It is not crammed with touristy shops.  Beutiful view We loved camping long point. We have camped there few times. The beach is long and it's great for walking. A Beautiful place to camp. The beach is amazing and the point main strip has everything you need for a great summer vacation Nice clean park.  Lots of poison ivy and be careful of ticks. They charge 14 dollars entrance fee but do not provide lifeguard on the beaches. Why would you drive hours to a paid beach with no lifeguards if Toronto has such a beautiful beach as Woodbine beach.. Had a washroom, long beach and good water.  No shade though Popular summer spot in the Norfolk and Oxford county area. Generations have visited the shores of Lake Erie here each summer. The name is very appropriate. It's a very long beach. Beautiful scenery. Hidden gem of a beach, not crowded the water is clean, beautiful sand and relaxing atmosphere. No food places close to the area so drinks and picnic food is necessary. The best kept secret! This park feels like you're in Florida or some cute cottage village! This is a nice beautiful sandy each very good for family's with kids. WARNING: AVOID THIS PROVINCIAL PARK AT ALL COSTS. It is a beautiful park, but do yourself a major favour: Go to the public beach access points instead. Very poorly managed provincial park, and the ostensibly nepotistic staff have proven ... Beautiful area but the ticks are unbelievable.. Found a few on the dog, husband, myself and many around the campsite..Got home and found another one embedded in my husbands chest and we were all covered in deet all weekend as well. Unfortunately it's enough to keep us away! Park is nice and beautiful 
Nice place for family picnic 
Huge kids playground...kids will have great fun 
Water in the lake is not clean tho.. -2 stars because of it small park, a long Beach, not ideal for kayaking or canoe as there are too many moter boat... Good for fishing and saw many people are cleaning fish near the boat launch area Wonderful place for kayaking, and beach is delightful. I been in many  places  but long point  is really  nice   place     I would   go   every time  I have the chance Beautiful area in general. Absolutely love it. Especially the beach! Great park and beach. Probably going to try a few days camping there. Fantastic grounds and facilities! Enjoy the beach and camping within driving distance from local eateries and stores. Best park !!! We camped there for Aug long weekend, water was warm and beaches are clean Beautiful scene.  Sandy beach. Family (kids and dogs) loved it. The best park in Ontario, wish I could give it 10 stars Love the place. Glad we were able to bring our dog Decent beach. Sand is more of a black or darker sand so it gets very hot on a sunny day. Usually not overly crowded. Excellent beach natural surroundings with a nice camp ground but close enough for a day trip for those living in southern Ontario We have been many times. I do enjoy all long point has to offer. FYI campsites on sand which takes getting use to. Love this beach.  Clean.  Needs a few more picnic tables Long Point Provincial Park is favourite spot for myself and many of my friends. Camping here was a great experience. The beach is long and some sites are so close to the beach it makes for a very carefree and enjoyable time. The comfort ... Gorgeous beaxh, however waves can be gigantic. Not kid friendly Nice and clean water. Not too deep. But no lifeguards Do not come here and save your money. It’s 14! Dollars just to get in to be eaten by black flys and worry about ticks not only is there massive sand dunes it’s quite a walk just to get to the beach so it’s not disablilty friendly either, ... Amazing place to go camping! Loved camping right beside the beach. Would have liked a bit more space between campsites though, you're basically camping with the people beside you. Long Point can be seen from space and is worth visiting on Earth Great time every time I visit Nice park and beach to enjoy spend a day you can have BBQ there and beach is nice A must go to place. Cleanliness  alone makes it a 5 star location. A very good area for swimming and picnic Busy when the weather is nice! Come early if you want to find a parking and the shade. I've only experience the boat launch that is less than a kilo from the front gate... could be cheaper for those of us just using the boat launch and not the rest of the park.. My favourite beach in Ontario. Very clean and there is tons of space even when it is busy. The beach is good but there is no park or BBQ area for family picnic. Amazing long sandy shallow beach! Came at peak timenonba major holiday and still found parking not too far away from the beach. The dog didnt like the water much but thats his issue not the beach and i loved it! Be aware that ticks are a thing down that way so chickity check yo self bruv! Unique park, great for kids and beach fun and bird watching Actually went to the beach, the beach is lovely, a nice place to walk and spend a sunny afternoon. Awesome time. $14.50 per car for the day A bunch of mosquitoes and tiny camping lots. I don't recommend camping here Beautiful beach, quaint snack bar and store. Camping at Long Point has become an annual tradition for us. We always enjoy our stay, park and facilities are clean and staff is friendly. Great place to swim or just hang out on the beach Long Point is a great place to get away from daily life.  Once you drive onto the causeway the sights and sounds of wildlife, the waves hitting the beach and the quietness of this world biosphere makes you feel like you have travelled to a remote place.  If you have been there you will understand! Full of mosquitoes, I mean literally. It is an extremely beautiful place with a long sandy beach however flies and mosquitoes make it impossible to enjoy this place. Great beach & family friendly camp ground Book your day in advance. Gets busy Lovely beach nice place to go to! Love absolutely everything but the poison ivy. After 1.5 hour drive, followed by a 1 hour line up for entrance... we were turned away as the park was full.  

I heard of similar years ago.  Thought we'd try it with our family all the same.  Mistake. Very clean park and the staff very helpful and friendly This place had been on my radar for quite some time. There's so much to do in the area, from boat tours to camping, to tree top canopy tours and zip lining. The whole coast is intriguing, but I really appreciate the provincial park, the ... Great yellow sanded beach.  Feels like a Carribean beach.  Dog friendly areas.  Cottages to rent.  Peaceful and not overbuilt like Wasaga or Sable beaches. Always good to hit the beach clean and dog friendly One of my favourite places to car camp. Friendly staff, nice clean sites in both Cottonwood (old park) and the other sites. Sites closer to the beach are in sand, a nice change from the rock and dirt. Be aware  that the closer you get to ... Love the beach here. We love Long Point Provincial Park! We discovered this beach a few years ago and have come several times a year since. The beach is nice and the water is usually clear. It doesn't get overly busy like some other provincial parks and the ... Its worth it if you love the beach but there are no trails to explore..but the huge sandy dune hills are neat to see! And the wetlands which are a natural biosphere.. If your into bird watching I'd say this is a great place for that. Went on long weekend ... 1-1/2 hours to travel the 8 km to the gate only to find that it could be another 30 mins to park and a 2 km walk to the beach ... We turned around and left ... It took 7 mins to exit and there was an 8 km long ... Nice walking place First time here and loved it. Will have to come back here to try out the camp grounds. Beach is sandy, clean and shallow for a long stretch which was great for the kids. There was even an area where the water was ""trapped"" in so the ... Water is very nice and and the beach is nice and long and shallow Great place to get away from the daily GTA commotion. Very good sand, no small stones which is anoing. Great beach, very family friendly, and very helpful staff. Add that to the natural beauty and it was a great day trip. If you arrive after 11AM on the weekend parking can get full and the park rangers will open an overflow area that is a long walk from the beach. Great time overall. We camped in the turtle dunes section right near the washroom. Mosquitoes were awful!!! Plus constant traffic to the washroom. I was shocked at how many people drove to washrooms/showers and it never ends all day! ... Beautiful park been going several years...just a bad experience this year....staff very helpful...got a refund for nights not staying... Nice  location with long beautiful beaches and a extensive Wetland to canoe and kayak around. Lots of fishing available.

The dog beach we visited was actually really nice and the water is quite shallow there which ... The water is so amazing, warm and clean Beautiful at day time but mosquitoes are savage at night time.

It was a good cam out really enjoyed being out there I'm going to miss it cuz I'm probably going to need to go back out this year coming A quaint area with many cottages on thin peninsula extending south into Lake Erie in southern Ontario. There are several  boat launches on the eastern side of the point ( the inner bay) . On the west side of the point  the beach ... This is the second time our family has camped here and we absolutley loved it. One of the greatest beaches. Campsites close to the water are also private and sandy. Overall a great experience.

It needs a lot of improvements Great gateway to relaxation Amazing place with great swimming The best beach in Ontario Wounderful place to visit Great beach. Good swimming. And dogs are welcome on the beach. Hard to find convenient parking so go early or just be patient. A spot will come up. Not happy a storm was coming in the next morning and they never gave us on a heads up that all the front campsites are going to flood so we woke up to 4 inches water on the whole campsite worst campsites ever and when I compliant they didn't care what's so ever worst provincial park ever and I been to alot Beautiful beach and well maintained. Service stations are clean. Family friendly and plenty of sand to do a picnic. Check check check all your stuff when you get home for TICKS!! we found 3 one on my wife and 2 crawling on our stuff we packed with us... Maybe a little early in the season.. To cold to have a shower..doors let cold air in, in the shower cubes. May 24 to iffy. Had a blast here. Great sites and a nice beach area to run the dogs off leash. There is a little store in case you forget anything and everyone seems very kind. Annual go to place... tried cotton wood and turtle dunes both awesome.

Comfort stations and showers were clean. Definitely going again! As far as I know, not many people know about the Long point provincial park or it's beaches. Which is why, I think, this place is still so natural and beautiful.

We went there on a Saturday afternoon just out of curiosity and found the ... One of the best beaches in Ontario like it, good place for camping. I had so much fun swimming here!!

An amazing park with some of the best beach in the country. We love longpoint. We just went last weekend. The only negative thing this time was the insane amount of mosquitos. They need to bring some bats in or something. I was blown away by the amount. From 6:30 in the morning till about 9:30/10 at night they are crazy.  Nice beach , easy access, ample ,clean Great provincial park.. Could be better if bathrooms were cleaner and or deodorized One of the best places to camp. Period.

Although the water may be absolutely freezing, it is ... Nice Beaches and warm water Great time Always good. Best beach in Ontario. Southern exposure I love going to the beach there! There's a lot of parking, the sand is super clean. The dog beach has a lot of cute doggies playing fetch and seeing in the water. The water is not super warm but it's Ontario and the sand dunes make you feel safer. Amazing beach I usually go early may and beat all the bugs but great place for bird watching and lots of near by towns to explore.  Great beach 👌 Relaxing Amazing soft sand beaches. Seems like Long Point is a really well kept secret Beautiful, peaceful beach. Best beach in Ontario The road trip going there was nice, however when getting there first thing realized is way too many flies. Way too many, seriously. I think it has something to do with the weed that grows all over the place.  Camping in the dunes can mean mosquitos are brutal if it rains. Main washrooms are great, lots of showers too. Privys are a seat with a hole, not the step on flush kind. Beach is wide, park was at capacity and still room on the beach. ... My family (wife plus 9&6 year old boys) just spent a night here. We had a pretty good site that was near the beach and was spacious. Privacy in all the sites is not great from what I could see. Bathrooms were clean. Not enough garbage ... Beautiful place to camp overall beach is fine, but the beach was full of debris.  Paid 14.50 to get in should at least have the beach cleaned.  It was full of broken sticks and  some kids got hurt running around. Beautiful sandy beach by the lake, perfect place to day picnic and camping. Only two hours drive from Toronto.  Awesome place to have a family BBQ.Then go take a swim.. if you are the overnight camping type you can do that too..  So close to the beach which was lovely and clean but the sites are smallish and it was a little noisier than what we like but not bad.  The is our favourite place to swim and camp. Lake Erie has crystal clear waters and Long Point has white sandy beaches that stretch for miles.  Beautiful location. We didn't choose the best site (306 monarch with no shade) but for myself, my 3yr old and pregnant wife it was a wonderful time. 
No issues with ticks although mosquitos were bad at dusk for an hour or so. Short walk to the beach and facilities were very clean and close by. Best beach in my area live it good waves Clea. Water Great day out with the family and friends like to go to this beach because hardly anyone there and sceneries beautiful can't beat it Great beach, large campsites, and have activities for children to discover and explore the nature around them.

Beautiful fine sand beach, convenient facility, but beware of lot of mosquito from the bush around. Great beach!  Camping area beaches are not very crowded. The day use area is very crowded. Nice Sandy beach. Water is warm because it us so shallow. Not many jets is either which is nice. Some of the camping areas are cramped for space ... The sand is clean and fine, the water slowly becomes deeper. There is ice cream nearby.  Parking, washroom, wild and beautiful This place sucks hope nobody else discovers it ;) The beach was not crowded, beautiful white sand and ample space. Beautiful beach with camping within a few meters. Will be back soon! Small to medium crowds, family friendly and shallow water for the first 100 or more feet One of the best beaches in GTA... white sand beach with no rocks... and do try to park in the paid area since you will find a good family crowd there.. loved it.. Clean water and really long beach! Nice little town to visit as well.  So far my favorite beach in Ontario.  Long Point naturally is a beautiful,  the beach was clean, peaceful and tons of fun.

On top of that, the sand was too dirty, hence, so was the water. So worth the drive to enjoy lovely water and beach Nice beach to spend hot summer days! Beautiful beaches and natural, unspoiled scenery. Inhabited part of the island can get pretty touristy during the summer and holidays, but still lots of fun. Hopefully these good people who live there will never ""sell out"". sand is smooth, long stretched beach, the view was great. the weather was cold though Excellent park Awesome beach The beach! The peace! The great family times !  Great very good summer vacation desitation Great beach! Longest beach on Lake Erie. Camping within walking distance from the beach. Great area to be Beach area was gorgeous and the waves were fun! The only thing was the tide creeped up slowly over time and we had to move our station halfway through the day. They had clean changing stations and washrooms and was such a unique and scenic drive to the beach too!  A Great place to fish Beautiful beach with lots of good restaurants nearby Great place for kayaking and nature watching Needles in the sand One of the best beaches in southern Ontario. Pro - very clean nice fresh breeze.  Con - keep your kids close while swimming there is potential for strong undertows  Nice park, very nice beach, the facilities (washrooms)are older.

Awesome beach cool sites awesome coffee Love the beach and warm lake Erie waters in summer Wow. Clean. Quiet. Amazing beach A must go. Water is warm and clean. Not over crowded  One of the very best beaches in the area!  Warm water, gradual beach, shallow water nearby eats and snacks We go here for the beaches which tend to be less crowded, cleaner and better groomed. The water entry is also shallow for a long while which some people appreciate. Sand is too hot can't walk without sandles. Lots of area to setup tents. Nice parking space. But too many mosquitoes. Beach, camping, hiking, this place is a well maintained area 2 hours drive from Toronto. The beach was clean and has a pretty long shoreline.  Fantastic campground book well in advance though Great beaches and super areas on the beach for dogs. Wildlife area is special too. Local area has some interesting little restaurants and Port Burwell has an Oberon class submarine on display with guided tours Great view Awesome place to visit for the day with a spouse or family. Really enjoyed getting it up this past summer. Will def go again next year.  Beach is breath taking. Wonderful sand dunes. Wildlife around area is beautiful. Overall a great family outting. Fun and sun... enough said Nice view. Perfect Beach. Terrible fly will drink water from your skin and blood. Pros - Beautiful sandy beachs, nice warm water.
Cons - Tics and other bugs a plenty, hot as hell in the summer and occasional lake Erie Algae. Incredible. So much to this province.  Beautiful beach. One of many. Get out a d explore  nice sandy beach at a couple of hour drive from GTA...just loved it Nice beach but it was super windy and cold the day we went (end of June). Amazing beaches and kiddy friendly grounds  Fun Great place to go for a day. Nice scenery Found an awesome quiet spot in the park only to be almost kicked out cause it is only of campers with reservations which was a shame Been coming for years, really nice Beach! Excelent beach  , great access, good parking, good amenities Great beach / view / clear water Long Point is the relatively unknown beach and bay vacation spot in Ontario Nice place I love the banding station the beach is beautiful and it's not that busy. Love it Clean beaches, close to a small town if needed. A mini vacation get away. Amazing experience. Very nice beach, great for family. My favorite provincial park.  Camp sites are smelly and dirty with dog poop. Wash rooms are too busy as there are not enough around. The beach is beautiful and coming here is worth a trip. Come early as it is quite difficult to find parking.  A lot of mosquitoes Nice clean n warm water Beautiful! But bring LOTS of bug spray containing Deet. Some of the worst mosquitoes I've encountered and tick central  Port Rowan is a great place to go when you are in Long Point. Nice beaches Not the best facilities, lots of black flies on the beach and whiney campers complaining about everything. The drive is just about 2 hours from West GTA  ,  but the countryside  drive makes you feel like an actual getaway.  Don't miss Ice Cream  at Twins  Great family place! Beautiful and well kept. Having a waterfowl hunting area so close is unsettling though My family have been going camping at longpoint for years its the best place in norfolk for privacy and quiet family camping. The best is the private sites near the beach and the beach is always clean. Would recommend it to anyone  Beautiful sandy beach stretching as far as they eye can see, Clean sandy campsite close to the lake, Well maintained and patrolled park. Only wish there were free Wi-Fi.  Our family beach Love this place Excellent beach and clean water Favorite family vacation spot!

Worth driving down. Very dirty water.
Dirty beach I've been skimboarding here for the young years of my life and it's the nicest beach in southern ontairo. Water is clean, people are nice and the sand is warm. Didn't expect yellow water. No way to swim! long point is my favorite southern Ontario beach. big area not crowded One of the best beaches in Ontario Horrible staff, one washroom for the whole campground. They say that you can't wash your dishes anywhere so what do they expect us to do? In Europe they have dishwashing stations in the campground. Also our site was missing a picnic table and it took forever to get a new one. Also it is a lime disease endemic spot.  Great beach. Great off-leash section for dogs too! site #359, family of 4 (kids are 5 & 3)

Pros; close to beach, close to bathroom, close to water tap, sand hills are fun for kids, beach is rock free, sandy and clean.  

Cons; garbage bins are centralized and require a drive to and ... Took my five year old son here for his very first camping experience. Had a great time, the beach area is gorgeous.

Our site had a lit of privacy. The washroom were clean and not busy. The trails were well groomed. The beach and playground were fun for the kids. The only down side was the poison ivy. There is a lot at the campground and trails. A very large, clean and well kept park. The main activity is definitely biking and I wouldn't camp here without bringing a bike. Beaches are so so.  When they list camping sites as without shade they absolutely mean it. Bring a tarp and some tarp supports for a much more comfortable stay. A wonderful provincial park with many large, fairly private and quiet campsites, some with electricity.
I love the beaches and the bike trail through the park. There is also a good camp store and a visitor's centre. Showers and laundry ... It's our favorite park and we try to go every year. Awesome bike trails for the whole family and you can ride to park store riding on dedicated trail. Nice Sandy Beach and I love the camp sites with many trees. Had a wonderful time with my family.

Amazing staff! Beautiful space! Great trails! And all the dogs were just an added bonus We visited MacGregor last week. We had a fantastic non reservable site on Algonquin,  and were very happy with it and the rest of the park. However I found the comfort station for about 50 sites to be in need of updating.

Was there just before the winter camping season started. Watched the winter campers set up their homes for the next 5 months. Was a great learning experience and fun to see the many different styles and ways to protect their trailers and enjoy the season. Walked where the skating path was going to be. Great place to go to We love MacGregor Point for its hiking and biking opportunities and for the absence of motor boats.

Come here often and it never gets old 2017 and before I Absolutely love camping here.Lots of shade and privacy. Awesome biking trails. I'm not sure what the 2018 summer will bring. With thousands of trees removed Nipppising and Huron campgrounds don't offer the same privacy ... Our favorite campsite in the world. Keeps us coming back. Looking to add more friends and family to the fun. On the east coast of lake Huron, MacGregor has a vast store of trails and beaches.  The waters of the lake are clear and crisp. Campsite was small in view of many other camp sites around. The beach was rocky and slimey and not great for swimming. There were fleas around our campsite and they came home with us so now we have to deal with that mess. 
But the ... Great place to take your family, swim, or play at the sand beach, ride bike, walk, or just relax. Great park. Very nice staff Did some winter camping here in their yurts.

The wood they sell isn't dry enough, so the ... Beautiful camping area can't wait to go back Awesome provincial park. Lots of separation and privacy on sites. Southhampton has everything if you forget something. Beautiful water and outdoor fun. 5 hours will go by way too fast. The campsites are smaller than other park. Hard to fit 2 cars side by side or even 2 medium tents. However, beautiful trail walk, dog beach and many outlook point (see the photos below). Washroom has good quality toilet paper and even electric plug if you need to dry your hair. Overall 5 stars! The place is nice and private at the camp ground beaches. There wasn't a lot of people when we went. Beach parking is a bit far. It's not right beside it. I truly enjoyed the mature trees and vegetation all around. Some of the paths are gravel instead of pavement which is really nice for walks!  Jul 1 - 3 17 Algonquin Campground Cedar Lane Campsites 120

Cons: 
1) the sites are smaller than what I'm use to (avid camper since ... Nice campground. Washrooms well maintained. Decent trails to hike. Relatively quiet in the evening when we were there. 

Suprisingly no signage to the washrooms or outhouse, so it's quite easy to get lost to and from. Why they don't have signs is beyond me. Every time I've gone I've loved it. Have always stayed in the Huron section of the camp. Sometimes there are partyers on the Friday night but by Saturday night they're all exhausted. As a nice treat, it's a fun bike ride to the camp shop ... Nice and clean park. Lots of trails. Good spot quite not to far of a drive Fabulous hike! This is an amazing park.

If you want a sandy beach, Port Elgin is just a few kms away. Took a guided tour with the park ranger and really enjoyed it. One of our favourite parks. Great park with full service town of Port Elgin nearby A place of serenity for soul searchers or a fun place for family and friends. Booked 2 nights in a yurt.

The final insult ... Good privacy. Nice sites. Amazing sunsets. Would visit again in a heartbeat. Great place for winter camping. They have a winter program for parking your trailer, cross country skiing and a 1 km lighted skating trail.

The camps are too close and small but it's the norm overall. The 4 Star is because the park rangers haven't been called on or noise yet, we technically have 8 minutes but my compatriots are... Loud.

When they list camping sites as without shade they absolutely mean it. Bring a tarp and some tarp supports for a much more comfortable stay. A wonderful provincial park with many large, fairly private and quiet campsites, some with electricity.
I love the beaches and the bike trail through the park. There is also a good camp store and a visitor's centre. Showers and laundry ... It's our favorite park and we try to go every year.

Looking to add more friends and family to the fun. On the east coast of lake Huron, MacGregor has a vast store of trails and beaches.  The waters of the lake are clear and crisp.

Have medium size picnic areas. Some spots can be muddy. Good showers and washroom. Found this spot after doing a google search knowing I would be in the Orillia area. It’s a great spot if you are just looking for a nice quiet beach, some hiking trails or a campground.  There is ample parking. The beach itself is large ... I stayed at Mara Provincial Park last weekend. We were at a campsite near the end of the park that does a loop. We had 2 secluded campsites for 8 people. Park Wardens were friendly. The beach is huge and busy during the weekends. Would recommend  10/10. Had a fantastic day at the beach. Loved everything about it. The temp was like 30° but didn't even feel it because of the trees n shade around. Small park with approximately 100 sites. Our site wasn't very private but during the week it wasn't too busy. Beautiful beach within walking distance. Loved it. But I wish they had a sign on how much entrance cost.like q small sign maybe put the cost up front it was 14 dollars and to pay in cash after a certain time for a day pass. But otherwise well worth the price for sure loved it hope they maintain it this way.. Very nice por children's can play it's clean. Cute park, sites aren't very private Wonderful little gem of a park!  We used it as an introduction to camping spot for our young kids since it wasn't that far from home.

It was nice but had expected better - perhaps the timing wasn't right. Enough parking spots and short pleasant hike. Beautiful wide trails. Great area! Great little spot to hike. Not the biggest fan of how expensive parking is. Honestly a lot of the time I don't bother paying. $15 for a 30 min walk doesn't make sense when all the other parks and trails are free! Beautiful park for a short walk. I really enjoyed walking through the long trail. I took my time and and struggled to make it last longer than an hour while I waited for my car to be serviced across the street. Close to highway so there a bit of road noise in the picnic area but otherwise a good spot for that. Beautiful place to stop and rest on the drive from Ottawa to Toronto. After a walk or a 15 min snooze ready to hit the road for the rest of the drive. Recently new washrooms but you now have to pay to park. 😞 Amazing place to take the family for a walk.. We find more wildlife there than at jacksons park. Love walking through here. Parking is expensive, worth it if plan on being there all day. $11.50 for parking a little much I'd say. Short but beautiful trail. Good for a half hour walk or so. It's a lovely little patch of woodland trail. Nice tall trees and some speckled woods. Icy but beautiful Very nice here Nice place to go for a walk. Beautiful. $11.25 for parking is expensive for a 20min walk Very good park too walk your dog clean but closed over the winter. Great for a short hike in town. Nice little park. Been going for short walks there for over ten years. The new electronic day use fee machine costs $11.25, seems a little steep for a park you can walk entirely in 45 minutes. I understand it needs money to be maintained, maybe at a reduced park fee. Won't be visiting anymore. Great quick dog walk spot. Nice place for walking A very nice, short walk. Expensive parking though. One of my favourite places; I've been coming here for over 20 years and watched the forest change. Well maintained trails good parking and picnic area. Small but lovely. Nice trails; went later in the day so only did the short trail , bout a 10 minute walk with kids. A short, easy trail through the woods. Parking is not free. Lovely spot to walk around and enjoy. Nice little day-use Provincial Park, with picnic area, and a pretty, relaxing interpretive trail.  Love the walk through the woods:) so do our dogs lol Historic preservation area. Good hiking. It is so beautiful in Fall! Beautiful small park with a couple of trails. Great for a picnic lunch or short family hike. I used to cross country ski here. My Daughter and I love this park.

Great fall coloursWent for a fall hike. It was nice but had expected better - perhaps the timing wasn't right. Enough parking spots and short pleasant hike. Beautiful wide trails. Great area! Great little spot to hike. Not the biggest fan of how expensive parking is. Honestly a lot of the time I don't bother paying. $15 for a 30 min walk doesn't make sense when all the other parks and trails are free! Beautiful park for a short walk. I really enjoyed walking through the long trail. I took my time and and struggled to make it last longer than an hour while I waited for my car to be serviced across the street. Close to highway so there a bit of road noise in the picnic area but otherwise a good spot for that. Beautiful place to stop and rest on the drive from Ottawa to Toronto. After a walk or a 15 min snooze ready to hit the road for the rest of the drive. Recently new washrooms but you now have to pay to park. 😞 Amazing place to take the family for a walk.. We find more wildlife there than at jacksons park. Love walking through here. Parking is expensive, worth it if plan on being there all day. $11.50 for parking a little much I'd say. Short but beautiful trail. Good for a half hour walk or so. It's a lovely little patch of woodland trail. Nice tall trees and some speckled woods. Icy but beautiful Very nice here Nice place to go for a walk. Beautiful. $11.25 for parking is expensive for a 20min walk Very good park too walk your dog clean but closed over the winter. Great for a short hike in town. Nice little park. Been going for short walks there for over ten years. The new electronic day use fee machine costs $11.25, seems a little steep for a park you can walk entirely in 45 minutes. I understand it needs money to be maintained, maybe at a reduced park fee. Won't be visiting anymore. Great quick dog walk spot. Nice place for walking A very nice, short walk. Expensive parking though. One of my favourite places; I've been coming here for over 20 years and watched the forest change. Well maintained trails good parking and picnic area. Small but lovely. Nice trails; went later in the day so only did the short trail , bout a 10 minute walk with kids. A short, easy trail through the woods. Parking is not free. Lovely spot to walk around and enjoy. Nice little day-use Provincial Park, with picnic area, and a pretty, relaxing interpretive trail.  Love the walk through the woods:) so do our dogs lol Historic preservation area. Good hiking. It is so beautiful in Fall! Beautiful small park with a couple of trails. Great for a picnic lunch or short family hike. I used to cross country ski here. My Daughter and I love this park. Great walking trails, a big Picnic area. this is mostly a walking trail park. There are 2 main trails, a short trail about 15-20 mins and a medium trail about 30-40 mins. The longer trail does have a ... Great place for a walk It's a small park, relatively speaking, but the trails offer a nice afternoon walk. Easily done with small children.  Walking paradise A really nice place for a walk. 🙂 Very nice little park for hiking just outside Peterborough. Great variety of walking trails. Summer is better Nice trails Feels like I time travelled back 200 years Beautiful forest $3 to park? (Translated by Google) Paid parking $ 3 for 2 hours. short hiking trail made in 30 minutes.

The lake water is always warm, clear and the little minnows are friendly. Staff keeps these grounds clean and safe Really nice park.

Not too much of a deep forest and close to a major town. Well worth it for families and kids. Beach Is great. One of the most perfect camp grounds ever. Nice and big with grass.

Comfort areas are very clean.
This our second visit here. We will be back again and again. Great beach, large sites with shade. Beach is all sand and shallow for a long way out; perfect for kids.

Will definitely be back! Best family time yet Nice beach and park Brings lots of insect repellent! Nice park with a beach. Kind of crowded in summer. Water is clear and very shallow which is good for kids. 150m down and still water is just 5ft deep. The beach front is quiet small. Lots of bird feature in grassy area.  Nice, clean and quiet park. Water is drinkable and sites are decent. Not all have privacy though. North side has zero privacy. Would still go back though.  Perfect place to go with the family, safe for kids since the water is not deep. You can't park anywhere on the park property and go for a walk without paying a parking fee. (daily fee). It's ridiculous! !!!!!!! What a great place for camping swimming, boating, relaxing and biking. I'll be back! The park does not seem to be maintained very well. Garbage was all around the campsite attracting racoons the entire stay. I ended up leaving a day early.

Beach strip is very small, be wary of potentially busy days.

Park seems more of one for fishing and boating rather than camping. One of the best camp grounds in Ontario. Clean, friendly and very safe. During the night there are patrols to ensure safety of all campers and reduce any noise or misbehavior. In terms of facilities, they have access to electric sites, ... Nice place for a casual day trip. Bring bug spray! Not bad It's a great clean and quiet Park

Not that great. Tons of geese and loons on beach. Full of poop everywhere. Go to Maya Park which is much nicer.  Visited with family as a Day User on May 31, 2014. Liked the overall experience.

Cons:
Too many mosquitoes, (Also no life guards). Good low budget park. Very good park, it's to be there with kids as the is very shallow far out at the beach. The site was spacious and well kept and the sanitary facilities clean. Beautiful views and great wildlife Sites are a nice size but there is barely any privacy in most of them Worst park.

Perfect place to go with the family, safe for kids since the water is not deep. You can't park anywhere on the park property and go for a walk without paying a parking fee. (daily fee). It's ridiculous! !!!!!!! What a great place for camping swimming, boating, relaxing and biking. I'll be back! The park does not seem to be maintained very well. Garbage was all around the campsite attracting racoons the entire stay. I ended up leaving a day early.

Beach strip is very small, be wary of potentially busy days.

Park seems more of one for fishing and boating rather than camping. One of the best camp grounds in Ontario. Clean, friendly and very safe. During the night there are patrols to ensure safety of all campers and reduce any noise or misbehavior. In terms of facilities, they have access to electric sites, ... Nice place for a casual day trip. Bring bug spray! Not bad It's a great clean and quiet Park 
Fishing swimming bring your boat or canoe we were there 6 days and always had something to do 
It was the first time there but I'll go back many more times the sites are also huge there so big that's what gives you your privacy Nice beach Beautiful beach, crystal clear water, nice facilities Great place to spend a quiet day. Not that great. Tons of geese and loons on beach. Full of poop everywhere. Go to Maya Park which is much nicer.  Visited with family as a Day User on May 31, 2014. Liked the overall experience.

Pros:
Beach, Opportunity of swimming in lake, children swings and volleyball/badminton (bring your ball/racket), BBQ.

Cons:
Too many mosquitoes, (Also no life guards). Good low budget park. Very good park, it's to be there with kids as the is very shallow far out at the beach. The site was spacious and well kept and the sanitary facilities clean. Beautiful views and great wildlife Sites are a nice size but there is barely any privacy in most of them Worst park. Nothing but s party park. Rules being broken, people yelling and loud music. Not a place for family. very clean. it is a execellent park nice beach Relatively  clean with the grass and trees extending almost all the way to the beach Nice area and good for camping  Was a good weekend with the kids and friends... The beach is dirty and there is poop all over the beach this will be my first and last visit Very good for camping I have been going there for 50 years! Nice provincial park Good place for camping Good park nice and clean and on simcoe Great park! Too many mosquitoes??  You do realize that you're outside right?

Tours of the mine and other regular interpretive programs from end of June to Labour Day and fall weekends
Hiking trails groomed in the winter for skiing
Car and RV camping, group camping, backcountry camping (boat-in sites on the Rideau)
Great mix of wildlife habitat: forest, wetland, old fields and three lakesExcellent campground. Stayed here in a Tent on May long weekend. Good space between sites, good beach and hiking trails. It is also interesting historical area with an old settlement that you can see on a hike. There are also canoe in sites that we will likely try next time. Store was small, but decently stocked We spent the weekend here and the camping area and beach are wonderful.

Our only issue was the wardens, in 2 night we had 2 complaint about noise. One of the nights was around 10pm, there was 4 of us talking with no music. We were told … We car camped over the long weekend in Sept here and really enjoyed it although I don't think we fully got to see the whole park. Our site was pretty private but it was a little loud due to a big group staying on the neighbouring sites. … Beach is really nice, canoes are available on site.

My particular camp spot was.. Odd. It was not well distinguished from the one adjacent.

The other one wasn't in use, but if it had been it would have been awkward. Right on top of … Always a blast going here.  Nice clean beach with clear water.  Not a very busy beach every time I’ve visited.  Haven’t camped here but driving through the sites look like a good size. Ive been coming here since I was a baby. Its one of my favourite lakes or parks in all of Ontario. The campers beach is a favourite spot and we go back year after year. Awesome park, with lots to see and do with such helpful and lovely staff, especially The guys in the well stocked and fairly priced park store. Will be coming back! LOVE MY NEW TSHIRT!! a wonderful park! remote and wild. lots of activities at this one compared others. needs more shoreline sites for my taste Great little park, unfortunately with our luck we camped during a heat wave like I've never experienced before so we didn't have a opportunity to explore the whole park. We spent it time in the lake trying to stay cool. Will be coming back to explore it, especially the mine. Murphy's Point is probably one of the best little Provincial Parks around for camping.  Great beaches, walking trails, nice facilities and located close to the historical town of Perth, therest lots to do for everyone. Wow what a beautiful Park of Canada located and the Beautiful town of Perth. Latest great amenities along with awesome hiking and walking trails. Parking is wheelchair accessible as well as entrance way.

Very much worth visiting My ultimate favorite campground. Even on long weekends it's quiet. Lovely time each time. Have been there two or three times. Campground was nice and well maintained. Comfort stations were clean. Camp store was decently stocked.

Campsites are not as private as I would like and the campground is very hilly and not level.   Have been here a few times before, but won't be returning after our last visit. While sitting around the fire with friends chatting one evening the warden came by twice to tell us to be quiet. It was fairly early the first time, and  we … The trails are nice. The staff aren't. Literally look for reasons to bother you. We had to clean our site out of broken trees and sticks before we could put up our tent and we got told not to pick up deadwood? Also there were a ton of … Trails could be marked better. Very quiet, and relaxing for a walk/hike. Most of the beach was still under renovation. Generally, could be better.

My pit was left in a horrendous manner with over a what looked like a week … This was my first visit to Murphy's Point and it did not disappoint. The sites were spacious and private. Washrooms were close by and clean. The beach was very clean and nice. Overall a great stay! We started camping at Murphy's Point 3 years ago and love it! Last year we did the silver queen mine tour with our daughter and loved it! Our daughter loved the actors along the way, but was very cautious! We leave Sunday and my daughter just can't wait!

The shallow water warms up quick in the hot sun. We visited this beach in the middle of September and it was perfect. The dogs enjoyed their time the moment they got back in the car they passed out I love this beach!! The fact that you have a choice of where to swim.  If you want lake or the bay 😁 With Lake Ontario on one side and North Bay on the other side this park has much to be desired.  The Lake Ontario water has a shallow sandy bottom great for kids.  North Bay on the other side offers warm waters and some nice fishing as ... If you are looking for a great getaway 1.5 hours east of Toronto. This is where you should go.  At North Beach you get to experience a white sandy beach. Food canteen on site with public outhouse's. Water is very clean and the sand dunes ... A great alternative to sandbanks and a great spot for a quick swim.

14.00 vehicle entrance
2.00 walk in from the road, can't be beat.

Obviously smaller than its big brother but the same experience, with both sides of the water accessible. 
Dog friendly, but patrolled much more thoroughly than Sandbanks. Great day park with access to North Bay lake which is warm and very clean. 

Also access to lake Ontario for bigger waves but much cooler. 

There is a snack bar with poutine we often walk over for and other meals and treats. 

It's reasonably priced and staff are friendly. 

Nice way to spend a day with the family. Loved the sectioned off areas for swimming. The buoys helped me to feel safer when my grandson was swimming. I wish I had gone earlier though to get a picnic table. Clean area. I will be returning again. Beautiful sandy beach. Could walk out pretty far before it got deep enough that I couldn't stand. Not overly busy either. Was 14.50$ for admission with a car and lots of parking right beside the beach. Great beach for families, but it can get windy at times. The bay on the other side is perfect for those days. Nice sandy beach and not too busy. This is a hidden gem. The beaches are extremely well kept and the area is very clean.  The park staff are very nice, as well as helpful.  Another great visit! Hot on one side cold on the other, my favorite beach for sure A great place to walk your did in the winter Fun place to swim, with a calmer side facing pleasant bay, thats perfect for kids and the main beach facing Lake Ontario. The lake side is fun when it gets rougher out (the waves get bigger) but there can be a pretty strong undertow so ... Beautiful beach with shallow waters great for families. A bit rocky in spots, but well worth it to enjoy the sandy shores. Waves ahoy. This is a great place because you have two fun options. The main waterfront on the south side, and the inlet on the other side of the road. You can go from metre high waves, to baby-friendly calm water within 100 yards. A great hidden gem, in the middle of beautiful countryside and lakefront. A little rocky but nice water and quiet beach compared to Sandbanks. Same soft sand! Rocky beach lakeside; but there are 2 beaches to choose from. Interior beach is sandy but im always squeamish about that dropoff. Beautiful sand bar with access to Lake Ontario on one side and a smaller quiet lake on the other side. Way less crowded than Sandbanks! Great clean beach, nice pathways. Walking fee 2 dollars adult, 1 for children. Nice area. Not many services (clean washrooms & change areas) as one would expect for the cost to enter the park but better than increasing the price a lot more! Nice clean place, we were on the ""dog side"" so it was quiet, the dogs were well behaved. The water was nice as well. We had a couple fishes that were not afraid of us haha that kept following us ...tiny things..freaked my son out lol but it was a nice time. Beautiful beach, lots of room. Having the wavy side and calm side for swimming is nice too Great place even though they were...""closed"" Great beach kind of off the beaten path but that's what makes it so great. 2 sides one calm and other side waves. Water was clear, and any danger was well marked (like undertows and drop offs). Beaches and dunes were well maintained with minimal litter. Lots of garbage cans, and constant patrol by rangers who are super helpful and constantly handing ... Fantastic soft sand beach and relatively warm water.  Great view. Surprisingly lovely beach. Entry fee was a bit steep perhaps Beatiful place for a day of swimming or just enjoying what life has to offer. Great beach but bathrooms need to be upgraded, other then that we had fun... Can we bring our own charcoal bbq here ? (And not drop ashes on the sands of course ) I’m hesitant to tell people how much I like this beach because I am afraid it will get too busy with tourists and the overflow of the Sandbanks. However, this is such a nice spot. Clean and dig friendly too. Clean beach. Lots of space. Clean water Great location! Was pretty clean. Not the best place for dogs to run free but a good spot none the less. Plan on parking on the street and walking in (its cheaper) or if you have a ton of stuff the it cost a bit more to drive in and park. Strong undertow at times, but a great beach Really nice, clean beaches.  Nice staff as well. Change rooms and bathrooms absolutely gross. Water filthy. It is Lake Ontario. Nothing in town but a Walmart. No KFC no Popeyes,  canadian tire. Not nearly as crowded as Sandbanks but with a sandy Beach and shallow water. Beach is clean, water is pretty nice.

West facing beach gets sun all afternoon and its a reasonable sized beach with lots of parking very close to the sand. A great beach with spectacular sunsets We are paying for the service but maintenance was not enough. I would expect to be clean when taking kids. Great beach! Sandy, clean, not usually crowded.  We prefer the lake side, but if you have younger kids the bay side is calmer and quieter.   There are lots of bathrooms, change rooms, parking lots, and there is a little store that sells ... Awesome dog beach, not crowded, and clean If you need to take a couple days off its the place Nice and quiet and not over crowded. Great beach, quieter than Sandbanks!

I learned some ... The water  is not so clean，with the
 feather  of
 seaguls I liked the beach, it's very nice Beautiful sandy beach A bit gravely but rarely busy. I like it. Awesome fishing 🎣 Close to the beach & lake. Great place to take the kids. The quieter side is covered in poop, dead fish, cigarette butts and debris.  It was much nicer when I brought my children around 8 years ago. I wouldn't let a small child play in it.  I tried to call to let someone know but I was hung up ... Shallow far into the water. Great for walking! Nice sand, although rocky between mid beach before sand again. Good place for families with children Not sandbanks but not bad either. Best beach in the area Great day in water. My favorite place would get 5 stars if they weren't closed for the season when I tried to go in September when it was +30 degrees outside Seasons tickets next year for sure. Visit for summer is good Clear water. Not many people. No shade though, so we didin't stay for long. We decided to come here since Sandbanks was full and it was a great alternative. Beach itself is not sandy, but the bottom of the lake is. Washrooms are very ... Beautiful Beaches. Northside is turqoise blue green with choppy waters , and cross the road and enjoy the calmer waters of a large lake! BEAUTIFUL THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS! Great location. Wavy, Lake Ontario one side and calm warmer little bay on the other side.  Little bit of everything for everyone.  Beautiful big beach Love this beach.

They even have a food store now where you can get ice cream and food like burgers, fries and fish and chips. Great beach many memories.  Great beach to enjoy time with friends and family. I make sure to visit this beautiful beach every summer. Gorgeous beach, almost never crowded. Dog beach is quite nice. This year (2017) craptacular - (1 star) last year pariadisical (5 stars). All due to lake levels.  See my photos for a complete understanding of the diametrically opposing states. Great beach! Shallow for a good distance. Warm water. Shade trees. Easy access. Lots of parking. Great for groups/picnics. Not much beach left here this year due to high water. Slot less crowded than the outlet beach. Not a big park by any stretch of the imagination. Actually, not even a park! A good beach though! Weekend was very busy. Probably not worth the $14.50/car. Great family gathering spot but could sell ice ! Cant wait for summer beach day's Beautiful! Wish it had a bit more sand to lie on, but gorgeous nonetheless.  Water fresh and clean relaxing wise nice and u can cook ur own food  The lake levels are currently high but this is a great beach with really nice and clear water Very good place for kids and play in water very shallow and clean.  Love this beach...beautiful..not too crowded Nice beach. Good parking. Cost to enter.  Beautiful and much more quiet than Sandbanks.  Many small rocks on the shore. Waves were rolling in today A real gem. More shade than Sandbanks, and less used. There are two beaches here; one on the Lake Ontario side offering infinite horizons, often windy and pounded by small waves (with a resulting undertow), and one on the bay side with a calm, sandy beach, and a steep drop-off after a short shallow slope into the water. One of the finest beachs around Belleville Awesome place North Beach is great to walk down and go for a nice swim when its hot out. After having a terrible time at a nearby beach in Wellington and sandbanks being busy I ended up. Nice clean and quiet.  Awesome beach. Quiet. Few people. Beautiful sand. A hidden gem. Beaches and sand dunes. Closed most of the year, just park at main gates and walk in. A great place to take your dog for a walk! Natural beauty. Clean beach.  One of the best relaxing places to go. Kids love the waves on the lake side. Usually clean, always enjoy ourselves. Best beach around. Better than Sandbanks because it is less populated.  A quiet beach area that's great for a walk even. You have a choice of inland beach that tends to be quieter and warmer or the Lake Ontario side with more wave action but better views. beautiful place for a summer day out with family, nice winds and clear blue water with ocean like waves!!! Definitely a hidden treasure. Option of swimming in lake Ontario or a smaller bay of water which is usually warmer than the lake Still cold, couple of months to go Can get very crowded on summer weekends but it’s a great place to bring the kids.   Love the water here. Some days it's really busy. But everyone is friendly. Get there early Really happy I finally went. Quiet and clean  Great beach for everyone,,sunset is awesome ,after 8 pm ride through on your bike for free... Windy day but great place....but people speed lots.... nice place It's a beach x2.

The sanitary facilities leave something to be desired however.

Excellente plage, moins bondée que Sandbanks. Les installations sanitaires laissent à désirer cependant. (Translated by Google) The view is beautiful ! There is still plenty of room. The only problem, this is the rocks on the beach. But it's like in the south. :)

Autre très belle plage du secteur de prince Edward county.","Over one kilometre ribbon of sand shelters tiny North Beach from Lake Ontario
The sandy beach is a great place to picnic on a summer day
Swim or boat in the sheltered waters of the bay or the more open Lake Ontario
A quieter park than its more famous neighbour - SandbanksClear and shallow waters, perfect for kids and dogs. They have a separate area for pets, it’s not big but doable. 

The shallow water warms up quick in the hot sun. We visited this beach in the middle of September and it was perfect. The dogs enjoyed their time the moment they got back in the car they passed out I love this beach!! The fact that you have a choice of where to swim.  If you want lake or the bay 😁 With Lake Ontario on one side and North Bay on the other side this park has much to be desired.  The Lake Ontario water has a shallow sandy bottom great for kids.  North Bay on the other side offers warm waters and some nice fishing as ... If you are looking for a great getaway 1.5 hours east of Toronto. This is where you should go.  At North Beach you get to experience a white sandy beach. Food canteen on site with public outhouse's. Water is very clean and the sand dunes ... A great alternative to sandbanks and a great spot for a quick swim.

14.00 vehicle entrance
2.00 walk in from the road, can't be beat.

Obviously smaller than its big brother but the same experience, with both sides of the water accessible. 
Dog friendly, but patrolled much more thoroughly than Sandbanks. Great day park with access to North Bay lake which is warm and very clean. 

Also access to lake Ontario for bigger waves but much cooler. 

There is a snack bar with poutine we often walk over for and other meals and treats. 

It's reasonably priced and staff are friendly. 

Nice way to spend a day with the family. Loved the sectioned off areas for swimming. The buoys helped me to feel safer when my grandson was swimming. I wish I had gone earlier though to get a picnic table. Clean area. I will be returning again. Beautiful sandy beach. Could walk out pretty far before it got deep enough that I couldn't stand. Not overly busy either. Was 14.50$ for admission with a car and lots of parking right beside the beach. Great beach for families, but it can get windy at times. The bay on the other side is perfect for those days. Nice sandy beach and not too busy. This is a hidden gem. The beaches are extremely well kept and the area is very clean.  The park staff are very nice, as well as helpful.  Another great visit! Hot on one side cold on the other, my favorite beach for sure A great place to walk your did in the winter Fun place to swim, with a calmer side facing pleasant bay, thats perfect for kids and the main beach facing Lake Ontario. The lake side is fun when it gets rougher out (the waves get bigger) but there can be a pretty strong undertow so ... Beautiful beach with shallow waters great for families. A bit rocky in spots, but well worth it to enjoy the sandy shores. Waves ahoy. This is a great place because you have two fun options. The main waterfront on the south side, and the inlet on the other side of the road. You can go from metre high waves, to baby-friendly calm water within 100 yards. A great hidden gem, in the middle of beautiful countryside and lakefront. A little rocky but nice water and quiet beach compared to Sandbanks. Same soft sand! Rocky beach lakeside; but there are 2 beaches to choose from. Interior beach is sandy but im always squeamish about that dropoff. Beautiful sand bar with access to Lake Ontario on one side and a smaller quiet lake on the other side. Way less crowded than Sandbanks! Great clean beach, nice pathways. Walking fee 2 dollars adult, 1 for children. Nice area.

Went camping with friends and we all had a blast. The camp Ground was very nice and very clean. The views are amazing and the beach is awesome. Great for kids for swimming you can walk out and not deep. The ... Pretty spot but so loud. You can hear the 400 in the distance but the road near the park is closer and louder. But that's nothing compared to the train. Still worth a visit if you want to camp close to Parry Sound. There isn't much to do at the park though unless you brought or rent a boat. The is a great park. Love the walk in sites for a little more privacy and you get your own shoreline. The only complaint which the park has no control over is the trains nearby at night wake you up at night which was never a problem a long time ago until they rerouted the highway. Had a beautiful site on the lake. Lots of people complain about the trains. But honestly didn't bother me all that much. Nice small park with a decent. Beach. Will for sure be going back. A small but charming park. The gateway to the Massasuaga provincial park. Which is more than charming. Went camping here in July as part of a road trip and we were very impressed with how clean and scenic this campground was. It’s located on Oastler Lake and offers a variety of unique campsites. We would definitely camp here again. We thought Oastler Lake was nice for  families and pet owners. Campsites were very clean and the park rangers were very helpful. We did not find it as scenic as many other Ontario Parks, but it was still nice for swimming and doing some ... Surprisingly peaceful and nice for a provincial park so close to the city. The park has a nice clean, although small beach and has a variety of watercraft for you to rent. The campsites themselves are bit to close for comfort and small ... Beautiful place to spend some time outdoors, beautiful beach and everything is fairly close by to the camping areas.  Just be aware of the train that passes occasionally - bring ear plugs for the night if you're a light sleeper! Great park ! A smaller park which is nice because it’s not too busy and easy to get around. The beach is perfect for a day of swimming / kayaking. The staff was very friendly. There is a train that goes by frequently making noise but it is not difficult to deal with. Will be going back had an excellent time. All the campsites are nice, flat and clean and almost all on the water. The main bathroom and bathrooms in general could definitely use an upgrade. The beach is beautifull but a bit reedy. Good location close to town if you need to escape :P Beautiful campsite, clean washrooms and even a shower with hot water not too far away. If you enjoy fishing, there aren’t many fish biting here. Great campsite for swimming. The trains are frequent and loud but we knew that before we came here, and it wasn’t really a problem the second night once you get used to it. Great park,nice large sites. The trains are not as bad as others have said, they are noisy but never heard them at nigft. The staff were friendly and courteous. Would definitely go back again. Stayed one night.  The site was private.  The beach was ok.  There was a train that often goes by.   It is an average Ontario park.   Worth a stay but I would not want to stay a week. This was a really nice small park! Even for early June the water was warm enough to go swimming. We were able to rent kayaks and our campsite was right on the lake. We heard alot of bad reviews about the train, even though it did come ... Oastler is a nice little park. I stayed at site #3, two sites down from the beach. The office with washrooms is just around the corner about a five minute walk. 

There is not much by the way of trails but we look a nice walk around the ... Nice park. It is cool listening to the trains going by. Fantastic park. Waterfront easy access. Canoes kayaks a paddle boards for rent. Staff awesome I strongly do not recommend staying at this park. The park is located next to a main CN Rail line, which I wouldn't have an issue with, if it wasn't for trains passing every 45 min to 1 hour and blaring their horn late into the night. ... Beautiful place to camp if you don't mind the train noise every now and then. It's a very small park, good for those with yonge children. However, there's a train track close by which makes it near impossible to sleep well at night. Also, because of the way the park is situated, you don't get to experience nature... rather you great cars driving by. Visiting midland went for lunch. Poutine was good large portions. Halibut was cooked just right. Beautiful lake, not so good camping. Campsites have 0 privacy and the train comes by with its horn seemed like every couple hours (even during night). Great park for kayaking. Train noise didn't bother us at all other than making johnny Cash songs like Folsom prison reverberate through our minds! Beautiful spot. Minutes from Parry Sound. Can't say I had a good park people experience - registration was great but rangers were brutal Loved our weekend camping trip here. So much fun, i like that there were washrooms and showers nearby. Absolutely gorgeous park, very well maintained by friendly helpful staff. One of my favorite places to go camping. The lake is beautiful and surrounding area is great. The hot water for the shower was not stable at all. I only had five minutes hot water and the rest was all cold. Same for other travellers here and some of them had to chose not to take showe that night. People were playing loud music, ... Park police try to act like real police. Other than that. Good time. Nice beach park with nice views of Georgian bay. Staff could do a better job at explaining things because we wanted to go to Massauga pp(extension of oastler pp) and there are 2 directions to go there: one for boating (15 mins away from ... Beautiful park with a pet swimming area. Our lab was super happy to play in the water here! We were just visiting for the day. Excellent beach, canoe rentals, warm water. This is a great little provincial park on Oastler Lake. They have a really nice beach! They also have information on Massasauga Provincial Park. This is an amazing park that we visit every summer. Train tracks near the park mean loud train noises throughout the day. We were fine with it, but others may not like it. Short drive to Tim Hortons, McDonalds, Walmart, Dollarama, Canadian Tire etc. Yes its a nice beautiful provincial park, and yes the trains and traffic are noisy, but the worst was the one car per campsite policy which is strickly enforced. We had to have 2 cars but they hassle us and give us a ticket. Such ... Good family camp ground. Plus it's close to town. Train tracks are a bit annoying but easily ignored. Camping spots on lakes with no power boats are better. Lots of snakes! Cool place to camp, swimming and camping us awesome. Great park . The sites are great size. The staff is friendly. The people are amazing. Kris of regulars here. The only thing that people may not be able to tolerate is the train as it's loud ! i live in parry sound and camp here regularly since its 15 mins away from my house, my son loves it! camp sites are nice! public beach is large enough to give space. there are boat rentals i rent canoe usually when i go, good change of ... So beautiful! There is an active bear but it's only a small black bear. The train sound is not bad at all; if you are an extremely light sleeper I would suggest picking a campground on the point! The walk in campsites are very quiet and much more private. Washrooms are clean. Other then the trains it's a great park The good: campsites are close to the lake. The bad: terrible noise from the train. Beautiful sight to wake up to. Sites were nice however the trains were constant. Beautiful park but had a tree come down on the sister in laws SUV during a storm. Good place to take kids swimming First Family Camping Trip Canoe & kayak rentals available I can't even begin!!! 
Truly spectacular! The best camping I've ever experienced. This Provincial park is well cared for and maintained. Each camping spot is unique, almost all sites have views of the gorgeous lake. There are ... Impossible to sleep! Trains pass throughout the night and so close the ground shakes.  Oastler drive is also busy just adding to the noise. Too bad because it is a beautiful park. Nice spot to get away for a weekend. Fairly quiet. Great place to camp, though if you hate the sounds of trains - Don't go. A gorgeous smaller park to explore with an abundance of hidden gems. Lots of good swimming spots, too! Close to stores in case you've forgotten anything. There is a railroad nearby however come time to sleep there were no more trains - our sleep was not disturbed.  Been going for years   looking old and run down, roads overgrown etc Trains sounding off on the hour every hour throughout the night. Tried the place twice on different years. Same result. No sleep. Also be warned. Leeches in the lake.  Noisy train that goes through the park and wakes you up. i've camped here a few times and always enjoy coming back, great little park with amazing views clean facilities and a nice little beach. 

lots of wildlife in the park including black bears, keep your campsite tidy and you wont have any issues Small clean park. We booked last minute and were lucky enough to get a site. Our spot was a narrow pull-through right near the beach.
The park is more of a family weekend type of park rather than the more dispersed type of Provincial ... Nice park, we had a great campsite on the water. Other sites seemed cramped and small. Relatively quiet except for the regular freight trains passing by, which is bothersome at night. Otherwise, a nice park.  We camped during the wicked storm on July 7th that shut the campground down. For as nerve-wracking and unsettling as the entire experience was, the one thing that surprised me the most was how wonderful and attentive the staff here were. ... Beautiful park, lake and views. By far one of my favourite of the Ontario Provincial Parks. We booked a camping trip this weekend at Oastler and were very excited! Based on the pictures online it looked beautiful and we had a site right on the lake (site 120). We got there Friday at about noon, and got set up right as the sun ... Oastler Lake is perhaps our favorite PP. Great lake. A variety of sites. Lots of waterfront sites. Close to civilization. Trains are a little on the close side but I don't mind them. This park is an absolute MUST visit! The park is 5km from Parry Sound, ON which was incredibly convenient since we were to board the magnificent and majestic Island Queen Cruise. Staff were so hospitable with inside tips of what to do ... Went camping as an extended family, second yr at Oastler Lake.
Looking forward to next yrs. family camp there.
The staff is friendly and courteous and very helpful.
Washrooms were clean, grounds were clean.
the camp sites are very ... Been  camping here since I was 13 I m 45 now  and my boys  love it  Beautiful place but the trains that keep passing by get a little annoying. If you arent a light sleeper, camping here is absolutely amazing Many lake front camp sites, will definitely return! Beautiful place to have a family vacation Beautiful park clean family oriented boats for rent Went there with group of friends. Campsites are too close to each and there is nothing to do, no hiking trails. The only thing you can do is rent a canoe for a couple of hours; however, the lake is not  big so it will take you 2 hours to ... Beautiful, clean and safe Camping site is clean, view is good. Difficult to sleep because the loud train roaring. The park had a large sandy beach, site 408 was large with very beautiful scenery over looking the lake...even got to see a Bear walking close by our camp site.

Not a big park, but everything is easily accessible, such as: beach, lake, water activity rental, dog beach, boat launch, etc. Man that train is annoying Beautiful sky, but couldn't sleep at night because of trains passing by ! Nice lake and sandy beach for the kids but the trains are terrible! They are blaring their horns in the middle of the night! We couldn't sleep at all. We left the next day! Amazing park with individually secluded camp sites Clean facilities. Loud CN Freight Trains every 45 minutes all night - bring your ear plugs! Wasn't happy that I couldn't get the site right next to ours as we were separated from our family and made it difficult to keep an eye on kids ... Very nice location! Nice place for family weekend A serene place by the water. We went there 3 years in a row. There's a train that gets loud while passing by, but you get used to it. Great sites, ok beach, no playground though. Beautiful park! Great for the kids. Awesome lake! The area is beautiful, however the beach is small and there is a loud train that goes by plus you can see and hear the cars.  Here is very close to highway and lake is very beautiful. This is a great place if you love trains, which I do. Awesome camping and close to the water...watch out for bears! Nice spot. Stayed in a site w good privacy. we were not happy at all every 45 min train is coming to kill u hahaha kids were scared of huge noise!!! the drinking water was devastating !!! as sign mention there were many bacteria then suggested to boil as we did but still smell ... Great beach and camping right off the highway.  Trains pass close by late at night and early morning This was the absolute worst place I have ever camped at.  The firewood they sold was wet, trains woke us up several times a night, and the park rangers believed their duty was to harass paying customers for nonsense.  I would not recommend this place at all. Always a nice getaway  I drove 200 kilometers  to get there  all the staff was on hand there but they would not let me and my son in the park we were not the Wright color this is in Canada. HOPE YOU LIKE TRAINS Nice lake Beautiful place Location and peace Close to amenities.  perfect (Translated by Google) Really really to be discouraged. The train runs every 30 minutes and with whistles woke us up all night. The grounds are tiny and there is no activity on the campsite. Also no washing machine and dryer available ...","Set on the Boyne River, minutes from Parry Sound and Georgian Bay
Panoramic views from the waterfront campsites overlooking Oastler Lake
Summer hiking and biking on the nearby Seguin Recreational Trail 
Great fishing for Rainbow Trout, pike and bass
Canoe rentals on site

 Note: railway tracks near the park are used frequently.This place is truly amazing. 
Went camping with friends and we all had a blast. The camp Ground was very nice and very clean. The views are amazing and the beach is awesome. Great for kids for swimming you can walk out and not deep. The ... Pretty spot but so loud. You can hear the 400 in the distance but the road near the park is closer and louder. But that's nothing compared to the train. Still worth a visit if you want to camp close to Parry Sound. There isn't much to do at the park though unless you brought or rent a boat. The is a great park. Love the walk in sites for a little more privacy and you get your own shoreline. The only complaint which the park has no control over is the trains nearby at night wake you up at night which was never a problem a long time ago until they rerouted the highway. Had a beautiful site on the lake. Lots of people complain about the trains. But honestly didn't bother me all that much. Nice small park with a decent. Beach. Will for sure be going back. A small but charming park. The gateway to the Massasuaga provincial park. Which is more than charming. Went camping here in July as part of a road trip and we were very impressed with how clean and scenic this campground was. It’s located on Oastler Lake and offers a variety of unique campsites. We would definitely camp here again. We thought Oastler Lake was nice for  families and pet owners. Campsites were very clean and the park rangers were very helpful. We did not find it as scenic as many other Ontario Parks, but it was still nice for swimming and doing some ... Surprisingly peaceful and nice for a provincial park so close to the city. The park has a nice clean, although small beach and has a variety of watercraft for you to rent. The campsites themselves are bit to close for comfort and small ... Beautiful place to spend some time outdoors, beautiful beach and everything is fairly close by to the camping areas.  Just be aware of the train that passes occasionally - bring ear plugs for the night if you're a light sleeper! Great park ! A smaller park which is nice because it’s not too busy and easy to get around. The beach is perfect for a day of swimming / kayaking. The staff was very friendly. There is a train that goes by frequently making noise but it is not difficult to deal with. Will be going back had an excellent time. All the campsites are nice, flat and clean and almost all on the water. The main bathroom and bathrooms in general could definitely use an upgrade. The beach is beautifull but a bit reedy. Good location close to town if you need to escape :P Beautiful campsite, clean washrooms and even a shower with hot water not too far away. If you enjoy fishing, there aren’t many fish biting here. Great campsite for swimming. The trains are frequent and loud but we knew that before we came here, and it wasn’t really a problem the second night once you get used to it. Great park,nice large sites. The trains are not as bad as others have said, they are noisy but never heard them at nigft. The staff were friendly and courteous. Would definitely go back again. Stayed one night.  The site was private.  The beach was ok.  There was a train that often goes by.   It is an average Ontario park.   Worth a stay but I would not want to stay a week. This was a really nice small park! Even for early June the water was warm enough to go swimming. We were able to rent kayaks and our campsite was right on the lake. We heard alot of bad reviews about the train, even though it did come ... Oastler is a nice little park. I stayed at site #3, two sites down from the beach. The office with washrooms is just around the corner about a five minute walk. 

There is not much by the way of trails but we look a nice walk around the ... Nice park. It is cool listening to the trains going by. Fantastic park. Waterfront easy access. Canoes kayaks a paddle boards for rent. Staff awesome I strongly do not recommend staying at this park. The park is located next to a main CN Rail line, which I wouldn't have an issue with, if it wasn't for trains passing every 45 min to 1 hour and blaring their horn late into the night. ... Beautiful place to camp if you don't mind the train noise every now and then. It's a very small park, good for those with yonge children. However, there's a train track close by which makes it near impossible to sleep well at night. Also, because of the way the park is situated, you don't get to experience nature... rather you great cars driving by. Visiting midland went for lunch. Poutine was good large portions. Halibut was cooked just right. Beautiful lake, not so good camping. Campsites have 0 privacy and the train comes by with its horn seemed like every couple hours (even during night). Great park for kayaking. Train noise didn't bother us at all other than making johnny Cash songs like Folsom prison reverberate through our minds! Beautiful spot. Minutes from Parry Sound. Can't say I had a good park people experience - registration was great but rangers were brutal Loved our weekend camping trip here. So much fun, i like that there were washrooms and showers nearby. Absolutely gorgeous park, very well maintained by friendly helpful staff. One of my favorite places to go camping. The lake is beautiful and surrounding area is great. The hot water for the shower was not stable at all. I only had five minutes hot water and the rest was all cold. Same for other travellers here and some of them had to chose not to take showe that night. People were playing loud music, ... Park police try to act like real police. Other than that. Good time. Nice beach park with nice views of Georgian bay.

Beautiful park with a pet swimming area. Our lab was super happy to play in the water here! We were just visiting for the day. Excellent beach, canoe rentals, warm water. This is a great little provincial park on Oastler Lake. They have a really nice beach! They also have information on Massasauga Provincial Park. This is an amazing park that we visit every summer. Train tracks near the park mean loud train noises throughout the day. We were fine with it, but others may not like it. Short drive to Tim Hortons, McDonalds, Walmart, Dollarama, Canadian Tire etc. Yes its a nice beautiful provincial park, and yes the trains and traffic are noisy, but the worst was the one car per campsite policy which is strickly enforced. We had to have 2 cars but they hassle us and give us a ticket. Such ... Good family camp ground. Plus it's close to town. Train tracks are a bit annoying but easily ignored. Camping spots on lakes with no power boats are better. Lots of snakes! Cool place to camp, swimming and camping us awesome. Great park . The sites are great size. The staff is friendly. The people are amazing. Kris of regulars here. The only thing that people may not be able to tolerate is the train as it's loud ! i live in parry sound and camp here regularly since its 15 mins away from my house, my son loves it! camp sites are nice! public beach is large enough to give space. there are boat rentals i rent canoe usually when i go, good change of ... So beautiful! There is an active bear but it's only a small black bear. The train sound is not bad at all; if you are an extremely light sleeper I would suggest picking a campground on the point! The walk in campsites are very quiet and much more private. Washrooms are clean. Other then the trains it's a great park The good: campsites are close to the lake. The bad: terrible noise from the train. Beautiful sight to wake up to. Sites were nice however the trains were constant. Beautiful park but had a tree come down on the sister in laws SUV during a storm. Good place to take kids swimming First Family Camping Trip Canoe & kayak rentals available I can't even begin!!!

Self serve pay station with a fee of $2 per person . Definitely worth the visit Though it's pretty far off the highway it is definitely worth the trip at least once! Beautiful sights to see! Easy & quick trail. This place is beautiful and stunning. It was a quick stop and actually smaller than I had expected. I knew the ziplining and what not were way over priced so I decided to fly it instead.
Check out the shots I got. Sorry for the window reflection on some of the shots. 20 mins from the hi way but well worth it for the 15min hike to see an amazing place. Stunning Canyon. My only suggestion would be to increase the length of trails surrounding the canyon; it's a beautiful area - more time to explore/view would be appreciated. Canyon was pretty darn cool! Just wish it was more accessible and there was a way to get to the bottom of the canyon scary bridges! Staff is extremely helpful,  lots of seating spots around and very nice little gift-shop.

Absolutely stunning, gorgeous, and brought back wonderful memories of my very first time here .... just wished the souvenir shop was open Quiet and contemplative, not congested with people when we were there. Views are amazing, wildlife was varied, and experience was excellent. Always fun and interesting worth the trip north to Canada to see Beautiful place, despite the tourists it remains very close to nature. Definitely a must if you're in this part of Canada. Such an awesome place... I brought the trollz ...next generation loved it This is a carved glacial path through the massive rock landscape of the Canadian shield. It took a lot of power to carve out the canyon and it has a beautiful, iconic rock sticking out on the left of the farther lookout. Definitely check this out while you are driving through.

The viewing pods are accessed by a trail, suspension bridge and boardwalk.  The total walking distance is in the order of 1 to 2 km and there are a few ... Its pretty amazing! If you dont like heights you'll be uncomfortable...😊 Beautiful views after a short hike, would definitely recommend Awesome view 😍 Such a beautiful sight of God's creation. It's a very special place Super foggy day but made for amazing pics. The views were spectacular and the paths were well kept (I don't remember seeing any garbage at all). There were no staff there and there is no camping which was a bit of a bummer but that is easy to plan around with other camping parks close by. The Canyon is amazing to look at and the trails are great. It's a bit out of the way but so worth the trip. Just a short walk to get a spectacular view and it's only $2 to enter. It's very accessible to walk, and you get a spectacular alp like view. Fog was in and did not see much but what we did see was spectacular Great stop while travelling along Highway 17! Really nice interpretive trail and boardwalks overlooking the canyon. It's a really special ecological area, and its very nice and peaceful. Well maintained trail, easy walk out to observation platforms. Beautiful canyon that exemplifies the beautiful geological features of the area. The trails are short and very easy walking. It is a fairly short stop, probably no more than an hour, with only two real viewpoints. The view was great, the routes were both maintained and wheelchair accessible, and the canyon had a few signs explaining how the canyon was formed and the local spiritual beliefs having to do with it. No flush toilets at the time of this review though.  Awesome, a must see Great views, nice hike. Worth the time! Year round scenic beauty Nice Views and close to Eagle canyon. Awesome trails, fairly short (about 1km). Lots of shade on the route. Bathrooms on site and a fair amount of parking. Takes approx 1 hour minimum to fully enjoy the voews Love Ouimet Canyon ..    Nice short hike to beautiful views  ... Beautiful! Not a huge park, but has a nice walking path to some beautiful views. Most paths are wheelchair & stroller accessible, but if you do the whole loop there is one very short but pretty steep hill to climb. Cheap, great view, friendly staff. What Else do you need. Strongly recommend visiting this place Great place Amazing views for free !!Must watch Very beautiful park, easy hike for canyon view. Canyon is beautiful, worth the trip No effort, stunning views!  Absolutely beautiful and pristine park. Very nice 1k walk to two spectacular views of this unique geological site.  Costs a couple bucks and worth it. Breath taking Great Views! Must see.

From the balconies overlooking the canyon floor, you can see lakes and mountains in all directions with forest covering everything. It is ... Beautiful site! Well prepared and cared for. Nicely done!! Spectacular viewing docks and a well-maintaned trail. Great place to visit when you have out of town visitors. I NEVER KNEW SIGHTS THIS STUNNING AND GORGEOUS EXISTED IN ONTARIO AND BOY WAS WRONG. Very clean trails and facilities. Staff is friendly and very helpful. It's really good for hiking and running. Amazing place for camping and for the ... Breath taking view short hike wide smooth paths a must see if you are in the area. Absolutely stunning, gorgeous, and brought back wonderful memories of my very first time here .... just wished the souvenir shop was open Quiet and contemplative, not congested with people when we were there. Views are amazing, wildlife was varied, and experience was excellent. Always fun and interesting worth the trip north to Canada to see Beautiful place, despite the tourists it remains very close to nature. Definitely a must if you're in this part of Canada. Such an awesome place... I brought the trollz ...next generation loved it This is a carved glacial path through the massive rock landscape of the Canadian shield. It took a lot of power to carve out the canyon and it has a beautiful, iconic rock sticking out on the left of the farther lookout. Definitely check this out while you are driving through. Easy trails to amazing views of the very impressive canyon. Amazing views of a dramatic natural formation from two separate vantage points.  The viewing pods are accessed by a trail, suspension bridge and boardwalk.  The total walking distance is in the order of 1 to 2 km and there are a few ... Its pretty amazing! If you dont like heights you'll be uncomfortable...😊 Beautiful views after a short hike, would definitely recommend Awesome view 😍 Such a beautiful sight of God's creation. It's a very special place Super foggy day but made for amazing pics. The views were spectacular and the paths were well kept (I don't remember seeing any garbage at all). There were no staff there and there is no camping which was a bit of a bummer but that is easy to plan around with other camping parks close by. The Canyon is amazing to look at and the trails are great. It's a bit out of the way but so worth the trip. Just a short walk to get a spectacular view and it's only $2 to enter. It's very accessible to walk, and you get a spectacular alp like view. Fog was in and did not see much but what we did see was spectacular Great stop while travelling along Highway 17! Really nice interpretive trail and boardwalks overlooking the canyon. It's a really special ecological area, and its very nice and peaceful. Well maintained trail, easy walk out to observation platforms. Beautiful canyon that exemplifies the beautiful geological features of the area. The trails are short and very easy walking. It is a fairly short stop, probably no more than an hour, with only two real viewpoints. The view was great, the routes were both maintained and wheelchair accessible, and the canyon had a few signs explaining how the canyon was formed and the local spiritual beliefs having to do with it. No flush toilets at the time of this review though.  Awesome, a must see Great views, nice hike. Worth the time! Year round scenic beauty Nice Views and close to Eagle canyon. Awesome trails, fairly short (about 1km). Lots of shade on the route. Bathrooms on site and a fair amount of parking. Takes approx 1 hour minimum to fully enjoy the voews Love Ouimet Canyon ..    Nice short hike to beautiful views  ... Beautiful! Not a huge park, but has a nice walking path to some beautiful views. Most paths are wheelchair & stroller accessible, but if you do the whole loop there is one very short but pretty steep hill to climb. Cheap, great view, friendly staff. What Else do you need. Strongly recommend visiting this place Great place Amazing views for free !!Must watch Very beautiful park, easy hike for canyon view. Canyon is beautiful, worth the trip No effort, stunning views!  Absolutely beautiful and pristine park. Very nice 1k walk to two spectacular views of this unique geological site.  Costs a couple bucks and worth it. Breath taking Great Views! Must see. Breathtaking  Simply put, beautiful Excellent history A definite go! Beautiful Beautiful!!! (Translated by Google) The view is fantastic!

Clean, sandy, beautiful beaches, great campsite sizes, usually great neighbors & all around wonderful experience. Love it here! Gorgeous beach! Look forward to returning but they really need to work on the campsite outhouses. We could smell them on the regular from our campsite (not good when you're trying to eat, relax or enjoy campfire!) Beautiful beach on Lake Superior.  Many nice campsites, but some are way to close to the highway.  I wish they would close the first row and let it fill in with bush as a bit of a buffer.  Suffers the same reservation issues as all Provincial Parks. Excellent stopover for road trips through sparse Northern Ontario.  Great for camping, and also some of Canada's best wood carvings available nearby.  Nicely located for a stop between Thunder Bay and Sudbury. Great place to stop, get gas, stretch your legs, and shop.  They also have a little deli which was convenient because I was staying in a motel down the road.  I hope one day to get back with more time to look around their very cool shop.  Very friendly service.  I'd highly recommend stopping by to have a look around. Incredible sandy beach with a dedicated section for dogs. Today all the dogs were well socialized and on leashes. Cool water, hot sand and a warm breeze made for an excellent day at the beach. It's a great spot to bring the kids because ... Excellent beach! Camping spaces can be a bit tight for big rigs however, so be careful. This is a place that i held great expectations for since i came here as a child.  Very nice area, but the toilets are seldom pumped out and many of the trails are in need of serious maintenance.  We had complained about people running ... Nice campsites, but a little noisy because of the highway traffic. Beautiful beach. Cell service coverage. Evening (movie night) and day programs offered primarily for kids. My main complaints was the delay in removing ""boil water ... One of the few spots where you can actually enjoy swimming in Lake Superior. Very nice park, but busy all summer long. One of my favorite places to visit relax and shop . Local artists crafts . Great variety Loved camping there. Spots are relatively private and service is good. Swimming is awesome with a long sandy beach. It’s was wonderful experience for the first timers. We enjoyed camping, they have bathrooms, water, etc . The place we stayed was right across the beach, easy for kids to play in the water. Very clean wonderful and helpful staff. Been coming here for over 12 years and will be coming back for manny more. Hope to see you there Right off the highway, nice beach but lots of garbage left at sites from previous campers. Could use more trash cans. Still beats a motel! I normally don’t leave reviews on things but since we have became interested in camping I heavily rely on reviews of each park. I don’t care much to read about how many bugs there were or how loud children were or about dogs barking ... One of the best provincial parks in Ontario in my mind. The beach alone reminds me of the Caribbean. It's a massive campground. Lots of kids areas, and a huge beach. But so much busier then we're used too.  Inexpensive, showers, toilets and electrical hookups, sewage dumping, water filling stations too. Would have given 5 stars except for the fire ban. I like cooking over open fire. Just not camping without fire. Pancake Bay Provincal Park is located right on Lake Superior. The sites are quite private as they are densely treed. We went in the beginning of May. The park is open, but there is no one at the front gate and it's self serve camping, at ... Went to Pancake Bay for the first time. It was a great experience. Lots of campsites to choose from. Beautiful beach. They have a dog beach. The staff are very friendly. The park is very clean. I will definitely be back great camping spot. Best beach in Ontario. Nice campground and picnic area.  Hiking trails available A beautiful provincial park with fine facilities and great people on staff. Awesome campground.  Well taken care of.  
Great sandy beaches and clear...clear  water.
10 star for me. :) Amazing beach and close to the highway Decent place, a bit too far from the GTA, but it's a good option if you can't find something closer to your city. The campsites are a very nice size, with room for multiple tents, lots of tree cover, and great facilities (showers and laundry and flush toilets). Wonderful, a must stop, lots of nice beach area, shaded eating area, clean bathrooms, nice staff This place is so beautiful. Very clean trails and facilities. Staff is friendly and very helpful. It's really good for  running. Amazing place for camping and for the family. It has very beautiful scenic sights as well. Recommended 10 outta 10. The beach is very pretty and we'll kept This is the most awesome place to stop! There is something of interest for every traveler. Just beautiful. Luvly scenery. If you get a chance stop.

The campground is large and it's easy to get a site without booking too far ahead.  The beach pristine and completely sand, there are shower facilities, a playground and ... We camped overnight here. It was beautiful getting to wake up beside the beach, looking out on the lake. Highly recommend it even though the water was freezing! Stunningly beautiful beach and bay, with a well-run campground. Disappointed that we couldn't have a fire though. We have been going to Pancake by since 2007. We have stayed in the Yurts at the south end of the park. Those yurts are near the park boundary so that they effectively have a private beach area. Very few people wander down that far. We ... Awesome long sandy beach. Clear water. Great kayaking at park and nearby. Many pull through trailer sites and large tent sites. Have flush toilets, laundromat and showers including WC accessible showers and toilets. Shower water cold near end of day. Have firewood for sale. I loved this park! Its clean people are close enough but not too close and even the sites that say they arent private are pretty private. The beach is super clean but I would suggest wearing water shows near the beach is pretty rocky. its a super romantic park if you get a spot near the water. I had a blast! $120.00 to cancel my reservation over a month before my reservation date. I did all the work online to reserve and cancel. No human interaction and I’m out $120.00. Ridiculous cancelation fees. Awesome sandy beach.  Marks almost the halfway point between Toronto and Thunder bay.  I always spend the night here when I am driving the trip back and forth.  Clean showers with hot water!

Panoramic view of Lake Superior from the Edmund Fitzgerald Lookout hiking trail
The park is located along the historic paddling route of the Voyageurs
A camping experience for everyone: large RV sites, car camping and yurts
Barrier-free campsites, washroom facilities and beach access.
A short drive from many regional attractionsGood Campsites, although I would avoid the ones that are right next to the highway as there is lots of noise from the passing trucks. Fantastic Beach with great sand and clear water. Water is a little cold, but it is lake Superior. ... My favourite camping spot!! Clean, sandy, beautiful beaches, great campsite sizes, usually great neighbors & all around wonderful experience. Love it here! Gorgeous beach! Look forward to returning but they really need to work on the campsite outhouses. We could smell them on the regular from our campsite (not good when you're trying to eat, relax or enjoy campfire!) Beautiful beach on Lake Superior.  Many nice campsites, but some are way to close to the highway.  I wish they would close the first row and let it fill in with bush as a bit of a buffer.  Suffers the same reservation issues as all Provincial Parks. Excellent stopover for road trips through sparse Northern Ontario.  Great for camping, and also some of Canada's best wood carvings available nearby.  Nicely located for a stop between Thunder Bay and Sudbury. Great place to stop, get gas, stretch your legs, and shop.  They also have a little deli which was convenient because I was staying in a motel down the road.  I hope one day to get back with more time to look around their very cool shop.  Very friendly service.  I'd highly recommend stopping by to have a look around. Incredible sandy beach with a dedicated section for dogs. Today all the dogs were well socialized and on leashes. Cool water, hot sand and a warm breeze made for an excellent day at the beach. It's a great spot to bring the kids because ... Excellent beach! Camping spaces can be a bit tight for big rigs however, so be careful. This is a place that i held great expectations for since i came here as a child.  Very nice area, but the toilets are seldom pumped out and many of the trails are in need of serious maintenance.  We had complained about people running ... Nice campsites, but a little noisy because of the highway traffic. Beautiful beach. Cell service coverage. Evening (movie night) and day programs offered primarily for kids. My main complaints was the delay in removing ""boil water ... One of the few spots where you can actually enjoy swimming in Lake Superior. Very nice park, but busy all summer long. One of my favorite places to visit relax and shop . Local artists crafts . Great variety Loved camping there. Spots are relatively private and service is good. Swimming is awesome with a long sandy beach. It’s was wonderful experience for the first timers. We enjoyed camping, they have bathrooms, water, etc . The place we stayed was right across the beach, easy for kids to play in the water. Very clean wonderful and helpful staff. Been coming here for over 12 years and will be coming back for manny more. Hope to see you there Right off the highway, nice beach but lots of garbage left at sites from previous campers. Could use more trash cans. Still beats a motel! I normally don’t leave reviews on things but since we have became interested in camping I heavily rely on reviews of each park. I don’t care much to read about how many bugs there were or how loud children were or about dogs barking ... One of the best provincial parks in Ontario in my mind. The beach alone reminds me of the Caribbean. It's a massive campground. Lots of kids areas, and a huge beach. But so much busier then we're used too.  Inexpensive, showers, toilets and electrical hookups, sewage dumping, water filling stations too. Would have given 5 stars except for the fire ban. I like cooking over open fire. Just not camping without fire. Pancake Bay Provincal Park is located right on Lake Superior. The sites are quite private as they are densely treed. We went in the beginning of May. The park is open, but there is no one at the front gate and it's self serve camping, at ... Went to Pancake Bay for the first time. It was a great experience. Lots of campsites to choose from.

Great sandy beaches and clear...clear  water.
10 star for me. :) Amazing beach and close to the highway Decent place, a bit too far from the GTA, but it's a good option if you can't find something closer to your city. The campsites are a very nice size, with room for multiple tents, lots of tree cover, and great facilities (showers and laundry and flush toilets). Wonderful, a must stop, lots of nice beach area, shaded eating area, clean bathrooms, nice staff This place is so beautiful. Very clean trails and facilities. Staff is friendly and very helpful. It's really good for  running. Amazing place for camping and for the family. It has very beautiful scenic sights as well. Recommended 10 outta 10.

The park is well maintained and the interpretive centre is very informative. The site itself is amazing. There is a nice gift shop too. Attended the special evening presentation put on by Ontario Parks. Extremely well done, powerful, very respectful of First Nations. It drives home how much we can still learn from First Nations, their deep connection to nature, and the ... Great place but wear walking shoes and a headlight works best, sold on premise! Visited first in early 80’s before the structure was built over them. I remember being able to walk all over the glyphs and looking back it was obviously pretty disrespectful. I was 6 or 7 years old though, what did I know? Anyway, ... This historical site seems well managed. The visit was informative and enjoyable. No picture taking allowed. There are lovely hiking trails around the park. The petroglyphs alone, are beautiful and amazing to look at. What a magnificent snapshot into history we are given. The staff are friendly and passionate about the site.

Dogs are allowed on the property, but they are not permitted near the petroglyphs. Amazing to get the opportunity to see into their heritage. Will have to revisit to see even more. Be careful on the drive in and remember to take your time! Very Spiritual place for so many . Back to nature and a vibrant powerful place. Would be five star if visitor centre and toilets could be open a little longer than five p.m Great park with an amazing Indigenous history. Good hiking trails A splendid exhibit of our land's indigenous past Incredible and sacred Indigenous  place, so glad this has been preserved and protected.  The staff are super knowledgeable, friendly and helpful very interesting Historic site of significant Native Canadian heritage and spirituality The space is well done with good connection to Anishinaabe culture. The rocks themselves are on a different level. But then I'm of this culture. A wonderful day get away! Trails are nice and staff is very knowledgeable about the history of the site. If something feels lack luster, don't be shy and ask a few questions! Very nice park, the building that housed the Petroglyphs was spacious and easy to see everything, The staff here is excellent and open to all questions. Had an amazing visit at the Petroglyphs. We were lucky to attend the same night as the evening presentation where they explained the meanings behind the markings. The lake was gorgeous!!! Short drive away from multiple camp sites! Worth a visit! It's great to feel a connection to people from thousands of years ago through the petroglyphs Was cool seeing 1000 year old history being preserved. Interesting place to visit. Not for younger children in my opinion. The Glyphs were amazing to see ....the hike was awesome as well . Loved this place! Great hiking trails and very informed staff. Great place to see some historical and spiritual part of Canada. Beautiful park with lots of history. Wish we could take pics of the petroglyphs. Also lots of huge flys that want to be tour friend and will want to escape in the car with you. A must see if you're in the area! Very interesting and educational place.

Thank you for a beautiful day of healing❤🙌🌲 What a waste of time and money and gas...it’s pretty much a whole lot of nothing between not much. $14.50 to park...I don’t know if that’s the norm, but seemed pricey for this park.

Very interesting and great hikes 2rl thumbs up! Friendly staff! nice to visit. A beautiful and spiritual experience. Beautiful place for a walk The staff there were very nice, and answered all the questions. You have a longer walk from the parking lot to the visitor centre. Then a shorter walk to the Petroglyphs building, a very spiritual and sacred place.  If your in this area I would defiantly recommend seeing this part of history. Very cool!  They take the preservation of the glyphs very seriously.  Bring your camera and a lunch and go on a nice long hike around the park.  About 10k of trails. Super friendly staff and great hiking areas!

I learned a lot history that tells us who we are from journeys of the past Great experience If you want to fully appreciate the precolonial history of this country you must visit Petroglyphs. I was humbled and filled with emotions. Still trying to absorb the magnitude of the history of the teaching rock. Cool place. Great park for walks and learning some history. Very good. A bit of a drive. Seniors should make sure to use the seniors parking lot. There is a bit of a walk from the regular parking lot to the visitor centre. A good afternoon visit. Lots of bugs in the springtime, but the Petroglyphs are indoors! Really great dive into history. It's pretty decent though I'm not sure with the drive from Toronto to see Really interesting place, park warden was fantastic gave us so much more information about the history, culture etc! Definitely recommended a visit! Disappointing and outdated, but still a nice walk and very interesting to be able to see the petroglyphs.

The petroglyphs were stunningly beautiful. Very Historic. Extreme religious importance. This is such an amazing place to visit. Such history. Wish it was a nicer day when I went.  Really well done preservation of ancient markings on stone by first nations peoples. Nice trails too. Incredibly interesting Great! I Can Finally Study For My Science Test!

Natives are the creators of lifes An amazing historical place, the park offers a great experience of natural trails...  Interesting place to visit. Enjoyed the walk in the woods.

Won't need to stay long Wow what a spiritual place! this whole weekend has been just an totaly eye opener for me and Canadian Culture. This place is great to combine with Whetung Ojibwa Centre, not too sure where it is because I didn't do the driving but it's not too far about 30 minutes away .  And Burleigh Falls is awesome. Favorite Provincial Park - 3000 year old rock carvings - Day Park Only - Camped at nearby Warsaw Caves - great campground close enough to make a day trip to this park. This place is incredibly educational and really neat. the info is very confusing is should just say open from may to step daily 10-5 instead of open........... Then open daily 10 -5 then close ........... I drive so far to find out is close.   Really special place. Long walk from parking lot to glyphs building. Friendly staff.  Kinda boring... Its just a rock with some drawings on it (Translated by Google) Good but not great. Nice hiking paths.

Bien mais sans plus. Des chemins de randonnée sympa. (Translated by Google) The prints are impressive. And I really like children and large can draw the petroglyphs.

Los grabados son impresionantes. Y me gusta mucho que los niños y grandes puedan dibujar los petroglyphs.  yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","Largest known concentration of Indigenous rock carvings (petroglyphs) in Canada, depicting turtles, snakes, birds, humans and more; this sacred site is known as “The Teaching Rocks”
Visit the Learning Place Visitor Centre to discover the traditions of the Ojibway (Nishnaabe) people through the teachings of the medicine wheel
Visit bright blue/green McGinnis Lake – one of only a handful of meromictic (layers of water that don’t intermix) lakes in Canada
Great opportunities for wildlife viewing


 Petroglyphs Operating Hours Daily 10:00am - 5:00pm (No vehicle access after 4:30pm. All vehicles must exit before gates close at 5:30pm). The park is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays in the Spring and Fall with the exception of Holiday Mondays.Always saw a sign for this place & never stopped to check it until recently. Great learning experience for our little ones but also ourselves. So neat! Perfect educational spot. Long drive in off the main road but we’ll protected. Clean & maintainers nicely! I'm so impressed with the way that Ontario Provincial Parks has both preserved and continues to protect this sacred site. Staff were very friendly and approachable. Being of First Nation ancestry....I also felt the staff made great ... Amazing place. The energy you could feel.  Mike the warden was full of knowledge and a joy to talk with.
I look forward to doing a night visit and hear the water run when the times are correct. 
If you want to see a truly amazing native ... Great walking tour of ancient human art that has been preserved from the elements for posterity. Truly amazing to behold. An absolute must, at least once. We owe that much to our ancient predecessors who worked so hard to create these. Nice hiking place to visit for the day from Toronto. The drive was about 3 hours, parking costs 13 CAD and it is advised to bring your own food and water. On a fast walking pace both circuits can be completed in 3 hours. Stopping around ... No photographs allowed of the petroglyphs, which are protected by a ranger-supervised enclosure as it is an active spiritual site used by the First Nations. Hence, it is a peaceful and contemplative space infused with the scent of recent smudging. It seems like a nice place, but little of it made any sense to me. Your experience will probably be more educational than my own. What are ya gonna do. We found this by accident when researching what to do in the area.  It’s amazing the petroglyphs have survived all this time and I’m glad they’re preserved in a building from further damage.  An important spiritual place and thank you to ...

However the sites are small, I feel like your waking up to being on your neighbors site. If this was all that was available than I would go back, but there are definitely better parks in Ontario. It’s a nice park. It would have been better if that Maynard guy wasn’t there trying to convince people that his grandfathers campfire story means the park is his but oh well, there’s always someone trying to get something for nothing. I’ll visit again for sure, when they get it all sorted and kick that guy out. Loved the experience for renting canoe/kayaks, dog beach, biking around the wooded forest and the ice cream is delicious!

Great place for hiking, biking and swimming. We booked riverside camping and got really good size of camping site with power and privacy.

Having said that, I would have given five stars for ... The family loves this place. Always a great time and they have spots in the winter for us hard core campers. Thanks. Beautiful beach with tons of space. Campsites are huge and the water is so nice but some of the beaches have a lot of rocks. Make sure to grab an icecream on your way out. Always enjoyed camping here, not a fan of the rock beaches though. Cool place, i only stayed one night but definitely need to go back, there's a network of small rivers that would be Great yo explore paddling and trails that would be great to walk or bike. Nice provincial park. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Beaches are nice. This is a very busy park. There are alot of sites so they are quite varied in privacy and size. Park layout is pretty confusing for a 1st timer and signage isn't the ... We had a great stay here. The weather was rainy but we made the best out of it and it is a nice park. They were even really good about refunding our second night when we decided to pack up. I also came here to the beach a couple weeks ... Beautiful trails perfect family escape lots of activities fishing canoeing bikeriding restaurant in park clean bathrooms with showers and laundry facilities highly recommend it We had a beautiful stay.  The weather was great and the ice cream was delicious. The only issue is when we arrived at the pinery. It took us an hour just to fill up with water. Because everybody is in the same line. People dumping and ... One of my favourite parks in Ontario. There are other ones that are amazing but I just love The Pinery. It is excellent for biking, great ice cream place, the dunes are amazing and superb beach... Of  course it's different from Algonquin or Killarney but it has its own beauty and it is one of my top ones!!! Always love the Pinery ....spring fall ams winter when it's not too busy ! Quiet at this time of the year. Great place for a walk in the woods, and a snack by the shoreline. Overall the experience at Pinery Provincial Park was good. The only problem was that the smaller washrooms did not have any light in the washroom, thus making it really hard to use it at night time. Also please keep the washroom clean ... AMAZING place!!! We go every summer with our family friends.

The dunes are definitely the gem of the place as well as the incredible sunsets in the quiet evenings. They also have a cool community center and a variety of outdoor sports. Overall, a great place to spend the summer away from the city. One of our favourite places to go every year! Really gorgeous sites and amazing beaches. What a amazing place to take the family. Biking trails, amazing ""sea like"" Beach, canoe /bike rentals. Comfort stations with showers everywhere. Even their ""outhouses"" have flush toilets. Quite up scale for camping. Great  park.  Was searching for open ground to play Cricket but couldn't find one. Beach was excellent although there was challenge  in finding parking at beach and that Enforcement officers were not patrolling Beach parking spots ... Pretty special place to visit- great scenery lots to do for the kids great beach and trails too. 

Only down side is the behaviour of some people who visit the park.  Littering drinking on the beach.  Last visit had a bunch of kids ... The largest park in Ontario. Check out the weekly events. We loved the nature walk at night This is the premiere family camping in Southwestern Ontario. It's great car camping with lots of trails and for hiking and biking.
But, by far, the beaches on Lake Huron are the draw here. If you can, make the trek to the day beaches on ... New yurts were amazing.  You can now see the stars from your bed. Was here on Wednesday.  Was there in the morning with my mom, sister and dog for canoeing.  My mom and I had taken our dog canoeing last year in September and she was good with it so we decided to do it again.  We had to buy a day pass ... One of the best parks to go camping. The dunes campgrounds are great and in close proximity to the lake and river. Plenty of activities to keep you busy. They also have canoe/kayak rentals. Lots of trails to go exploring and overall great atmosphere It's alright but not my favourite park. Nice long trails for biking. Nice river for fishing. Beaches at dunes are pretty good. 

Always busy. 
I get poison ivy every year I go.
 It's everywhere. Stay away from the brush around your site. ... Great park, well maintained. Sites are slightly close to each other, some have more space and trees between them than other. The beach is great, once you get past the rocks on the way in. But that is indicative of that lake. Comfort stations and bathrooms are updated and clean. The beach area was crowded. Me and my friends wanted to stay on a shaded area nearest to the path to our campsite but other people who were in that area told us we couldn't because there was a lot of us. We had children who needed the ... One of the nicest parks you could visit. Plenty of activities to keep busy with. Great campground with lots to do like fishing, swimming in the lake, canoeing, kayaking, trail walking. Went to the dog friendly beach section and had an awesome time. The sun wasn't too harsh so the water was a bit cold..many pebbles at the shoreline made it painful to get into the water though. Washrooms had several tiny flies. Overall a beautiful breathtaking place! Fantastic time.... except for the little wood roaches... We didn't have any come home with us but I also think they probably want to stay there... They have a pretty sweet set-up. This is one of my favourite places! It's a fairly large park and covers a lot of different terrain.  While the beaches (of which there are both very accessible beaches and more remote, private beaches) are probably the biggest draw, ... The Pinery is gorgeous!! There is a ton of flora and fauna here, especially all the beautiful birds to be seen! The boardwalk to the beach offered a spectacular view, and the trails were a lot of fun to walk along. Be prepared for a) ... We went last week for 5 days, it was great. This provincial park is officially my favorite park. It’s summer so it was busy, lots of people for a weekday but this park feels like you have your own world. The beach is so long that even if ... Always a great stay at Pinery. Dunes #4 was quiet and sites clean and spacious.
Bike rides and kayaking and hiking... beautiful sunset. This park is great for car camping. It is easily accessible and full of comfort stations. The beach is super long and the sand dunes (a rare ecosystem in Ontario) are stunning. Then only thing more stunning in this park are the sun sets. This park is a must visit! Large Provincial Park in Granf Bend. The park has campgrounds spread over different wooded areas. Clean washrooms and showers, an amphitheatre, visitors centre, trails, bird watching, camp store, kayak and bike rentals make this a very ... Had an amazing time! I wish I could post pictures, but I was living more in the moment and decided to let my phone die instead. Sounds archaic, but it was actually really nice not to feel reliant on technology. We were at Riverside at ... It's a beautiful park on Lake Huron with large and fairly private campsites. The public washrooms and showers were clean and easily accessible. The staff helpful and friendly. It's a very popular park so reservations are a good idea, particularly on week ends. What a beautiful place. The yurts are larger then the yurts at MacGregor. One concern is the state of the washrooms at the end of the weekend. The Pinery is a lovely place to spend the summer. My family and I are going up for a few weeks, and we are looking forward to having an enjoyable stay. Some things that appeal to us particularly are the many beaches and fun activities to ... Amazing park to go camping! I stayed in the Burley camp grounds and my site was super close to the beach. The beach had a brilliant view of the sunset and sunrise. I would recommend taking your car and parking near the beach as walking a ... Beautiful park, very busy and because the park is popular, your neighbours may not be the greatest. Customer experience may vary The Pinery is a fantastic park. Everyone that I've spoken to has the same experience: Terrific!

The washrooms are clean, the staff are friendly, the park store area is HUGE with tons of options (from bike rentals to boat rentals to ice ... Had a great time despite it pouring rain when we first arrived. Stayed at a site in Dunes 3. The site was spacious and private. It had a campfire ring and a picnic table. Everything was in good condition. The beach was less than five minute walk away. Would recommend as a good getaway for a weekend. Everything is very used and could use updating but we enjoyed our stay. Beautiful huge park with really nice campsites. Lake huron beach is a little rocky but nice clean water to swim in. A great place to camp and swim. If you are staying in Riverside you will need a car or bike to get to the beach (it is a bit of a haul). This place is a nice place to spend time with good people. Out of the provincial parks in Ontario this is one of the nicer ones. One of the best beaches I have been to.
10K beach and everything was clean and awesome.

Highly recommend It's a very nice place. One of the biggest in North America as I read. It has forest and lake.
 I could see that the camping lots are very close to each other though. 
The signs could also be better, it wasn't easy to find some of the ... This is a beautiful provincial park with many facilities available on site. There is a campsite which has electricity available, along with showers and bathrooms. This park is about a ten minute drive from Grand Bend Beach, which is a very good location. Washrooms are kept clean, staff are always around cleaning and the beach is amazing. The province does a great job up-keeping this property and keeping it very natural. Great for campers, and even for just a day. Highly disappointed. First campground,  EVER, that we have been denied access to view campsites so we could plan an upcoming camping trip.  Wanted to charge us $17 just to take a quick look. The area itself looks awesome and inviting, so we can't give nature a bad review, just the rangers. Well maintained and one of the best in Ontario for biking. Beautiful beach and trails. Don't forget the ice cream shop!!! Park store has pretty much everything you may need or forget to bring for your camp. Pretty much the best park in Southern Ontario....

After 30 years of tolerating poorly designed, old and impossible to clean comfort stations..... comfort station #5 in Dunes is a prime example of a logical, comfortable and green design... One of the most beautiful Provincial park there is an all of Ontario, the forest looks like something out of a fairy tale and the park has a great amount of space to always feel very in nature. BBQs and picnic tables are usually provided ... Awesome place, clear water at the beach, great temperature as well. The Park is big, well preserved, worth going back. Lots of space for camping, walking or biking on the trails. Boat and bike rentals, and also some food options in the central visitors center. Great place but infested with ticks. 5 out of 8 of us got bit over the weekend and one person was infected with Lyme disease. Be aware! Very nice park. Lots of hiking and great beach, looks like the ocean. Some canoeing but really limited to the 5 km in the park unless you go out onto lake huron Great dog beach. Sites aren't huge but turquoise Lake Huron and the sunsets more than make up for it. Kids love the ice cream shop and the store is large and convenient. Extremely scenic and less busy than Grand Bend. The day use fee is about the same as you would pay to get parking in Grand Bend, and it is much more private. The first four feet of water has rocks, but it is all sand the rest of the way. ... It is very nice place for family with kids, we go there almost every summer. Great Park! Coming here with kids for sixteen years! The park is very well maintained. Each day there are interesting educational programs for kids of any age. Thanks, Pinary, for the amazing time! Wonderful place to spend a day with the family. Lots of great outdoor opticians and good camp grounds. I love Grand Bend, the beach is beautiful. The park is always clean and the flusable toilets at the beach are a bonus.  Would definitely recommend the yurts, they are very spacious and clean.  Great staff, always friendly and helpful.  Also the restaurant and ice cream store are a big bonus. Great place to get away from it all. Even if its just for a day Great clean sites.  Clean facilities.  Great beach! Loved our weekend visit! This is one the best campsites that I have been in Ontario.  It's a big park. No mosquitoes.  But lots of flies and lots of lots of sand roaches. I was very worried to bring them home but apparently they do not live out of wild life. 
Beach is a sandy one but also lots of rocks. Love the Pinery! It's small compared to other parks but always well kept. We camp here at least once a season ans visit with a day pass a couple times a year. The park ranger who goes by the name b. Lane was very confrontational and looks to be racist. My friends say they call this place finery provincial park because they seem to fine you all the time and we witnessed that and now know why. ... Always enjoy The Pinery Provincial Park.  Great spot for camping, whether in a tent or trailer they have sites that are secluded or open depending on your preference. 
This park boasts an amazing beach that stretches for miles so there's ... Amazing place for camping during long weekends, one of my favourite provincial parks. Make sure you book ahead as it books up months in advance! Loved this place. Lots of rentals for canoes for paddle boats. Great prices.  Lots of beaches a d dog friendly beaches.  Really enjoyed the day here. Actually, I give it 4.5 stars:
5 stars for the campgrounds. We stayed at Burley, the furthest one from the park office. The sites are capacious, each with a picnic bench and a fire pit. Plenty of very clean washrooms with toilets and ... Washroom is not much clean. Beautiful views Love the Pinery! Hiking, canoeing, fishing, swimming beach days etc. Plus all the programming they have available - what isn't to like???! The kids had a blast, and the sandy soil makes for dry campsites when it rains! Just need to be careful to avoid the poison ivy! Great sites for a provincial park..Thanksgiving weekend we ended up have a lot more privacy but a full campground would mean less privacy..that being said site 243 we stayed at is as private you can get in a provincial park campground. Great time!  I love all the extra activities for kids, even in the rain I didn't hear ""I'm bored"".  Great sites and friendly staff.  Definitely recommend. One of the most beautiful provincial park in Ontario. Absolutely hands down a must for anyone into camping.  If you can get a site in the dunes you're set.  Quick walk to the beach and unbelievable swimming for kids.  Just watch out for rhe coons, had one sitting beside me when I started composing this review (no joke lol) Surprisingly there were no mosquitoes when we camped. Had a nice little trail behind campsite that lead to the dunes and an isolated but fairly rocky beach. Daytime beach was sandy. We went there on a very windy day and had a great old time in the sea-like waves. This is a park that you need more than a weekend to explore.  Its massive and beautiful.   Be cautious if hauling a camper bc some of the corners are tight and we got wedged between two trees ripping off our awning. Probably one of the best stocked parks out there, however it's always packed in the summer so if you're looking for a quiet getaway this won't be the place for you.  Dog friendly on day beach two is always a hit for me. I love pinery provincial park. My third time here and I like it even more than before. It has all you want in a park: river, beach, bike, canoe, ... Rental and nice trails. It has s close to great bend where you can find good ... It's so great that they have a beach where you can swim with your dog. And the kids had a lot of fun jumping and rolling around on the massive sand dunes by the dunes camping area. Nice park but has become jammed with people. Year after year our favorite! 
Love the campsites at Dunes 1and 2.
Nice, large and private. 
The comfortstations are clean and well set up.
Awesome beach, trails, river and oportunities for kids to explore nature. I know it was late in the season (Oct) but I wish the shop was still open. Otherwise, always a great stay at the pinery. Love love love this park. Feel blessed it's so close to home! Magical place to camp and beautiful place to hike. We plan on canoeing on our next trip there in the early Fall. Our campsite was spacious and privacy was good. All sites come with a fire pit with grill. Plenty of hardwood firewood and ... We have come here all of our lives. Lots of camping and just beach days. We have never had a problem with cockroaches, until this year! They were everywhere in all of the campgrounds and even at the ice cream picnic tables! I feel bad ... We love camping here. All the facilities you may need are available (toilets, hot showers, laundry, etc). Lake Huron is beautiful! Fantastic place and staff very professionally run, lovely campsites and Canoe & Kayaks rental, for those hanging tarps over tents to keep cool and dry, the trees can be well spread out so bring 100ft of rope per tarp to tie off the 4 ends, each of the fire pits also has a flip over grate for cooking which is handy Clean park with clean water by the lake. BBQ facility available, in the great outdoors. 10 km of greenery. Perfect for a family weekend Stayed 4 days at Riverside campground @ Pinery. Sites were very small and right next to the roadways. Washrooms were not kept very clean or stocked. Yellow cockroaches everywhere and i mean everywhere, into everything. Only positives are ... This park has everything. Camping, Canoeing, Bicycling, Trails, Beach, Great Lake. Grand Bend is only 15 mins away where lot of water sport activities are available and decent restaurants as well. Always a great place to camp or RV, great sites, lots to see and do and clean facilities. Was not good and relaxing this time. The site with 10 young punks was so loud. Kept all 6 kids up till 2 am. Reported to pinery staff. They kind of said would take care of it. Hardly believe they fined them for that noise complains. Wish it would be taken better for convinient stay of all families. 👎 If your wallet is holding you from the beaches of the Caribbean, then i should say we can still settle with Pinery Provincial Park  
The waters are warm n peaceful crowd surrounding you. There is a special beach for family with pets. Beaches are narrow depending upon the tides. Bring your umbrella. Great place to come and unwind. Hit the beach or kayak the river or hike one of many trails or relax at camp. Pinary has everything an outdoor enthusiast would love. I always enjoy coming here. Great walking trails and good camp sites. Great family camping as well with wood trucks that drive back to sell to you if you need more. Bathroom and showers close at hand. 
They have decent sound limits at night to accomodate other campers. Overall it is a clean fun campsite close to Grandbend. Always a great place to experience nature anytime of the year Great place to camp. Lots of things to do. I only wish they enforced the dog on leash rule. Several times I was going for a walk with my kids and our dog and an unleashed dog rushed out from a campsite. Love this campground. Spent another Thanksgiving and wouldn't want to spend it anywhere else Fun camp ground. Biggest downside is one that probably can't be helped, but it is the poison ivy. Every time we go, all of my kids get it and it has to be treated. We love to camp here a couple times each year.  Great family trips.  Bike, beach, canoe, fish, no playground equip for the kiddos though. Clean water, levelled surface which is safe for kids, less bugs, rocks and people which make your experience far superior compared to other crowded beach. Entry fee is $17, you will be surprised to drive 13-14 Kms to get and out of park. So big and lots of things to do. It's a beautiful park with lots to do. Miles of hiking and biking, gorgeous visitor's centre, a restaurant, fantastic camp sites, tons of beaches. The only downside is the beaches are much more rocky now compared to several years ago, wear sandals. Wonderful park that has gotten far too busy. One of our favourite places close to home. Never changes. Natural beauty. Loved our stay here. Staff keep the park nice and clean. We will be back for sure! Great experience and facilities manned by knowledgeable, energetic staff! A large park with 3 camp grounds and some beautiful stoney beaches, trails and lots of other fun things to do - canoeing/kayaking. Great Park for families or couples that like outdoor activities. Have been going there every year for past 15 years. Highly recommended. Great camp ground, clean, lots of activities. Offers bike and canoe rentals and we'll maintained hiking paths. Well groomed beach, and a offers a dog beach as well. Location and facilities are great, the services such as canoe rentals are still as good as ever, however it does get very busy here, the day use beaches (on the long weekend especially) get super packed. Beautiful! Nice camp sites and gorgeous beach. Some ants and poison ivy but still worth going A very well maintained massive park. We are so lucky to spend time here Best provincial park I've ever been too! One of my favorite camping spots Very nice place to visit/camp. Nice beach! What a beautiful place to come even just for a bike ride...well worth a visit I've been camping here multiple times and I am never disappointed. The camp ground is beautiful, trails are well maintained and the beach is breathtaking! Always a great time at the provincial park that caters to the family.  One of our favourites when we don't want to fight Toronto or Hwy 400 traffic. Had a great time during Thanksgiving with my family. Sites were a modest size and private to where other campers didn't feel intrusive, lots to do and beautiful scenery. Nice park, Clean, Great beach. Love camping near lake huron. Beautiful. Saw 2 Deer and 2 Cranes. There was a Hawk and plenty of Bullfrogs. Water was murky where we were because it is a little inlet. Very clean. Must pay $5 to park. Here is the little cabin we rented. 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. One of the most beautiful Parks in Ontario! At this time of year sooo peaceful! Great family time at a huge park with tons to do! Very easy to get lost. Signage is terrible. Their maps don't help much.    Lots of really bad pot holes. Shower water is extremely hot. It's been hot but good. Only complaint is the shut down of things like the visitor centre during the week. Same thing in Bon Echo on June. Even shorter hours would ok but just because we are in the park mid week doesn't mean that everything should start shutting down. Great place for summer family camping!  Lots of activities and an amazing beach with clear waters. Maybe not the best looking beaches, but very nice park. Nice bicycle path and nice smooth river to canoe/kayak on. Great off-leash dog beach. Wish the day parking passes were cheaper. I’d come more often. Loved our time at this park! The beach was wonderful, water was warm and site was in a great location! One of the nicest Ontario parks we have stayed at. It is huge, 1000 plus sites..... The beach is superb. Great place to go with the family or with friends! Super nice.  Lots to do. Very clean.. Beautiful park! Beach is clean and goes on for miles, great spot to swim and go camping Great place to visit with family. Nice beach, canoe and bike rental, and clean washrooms. I also likes the ice cream stall. LOVE THIS PLACE!! The water is warm clean and so pretty. The beach is amazing and even the dog beach is super clean. There are tons of things for kids to do. And also the sunsets are so pretty. If you like to camp you will love this place I proposed here, it's the most popular park in Ontario, canoes, rivers, beaches, pines. Love this place. Lost to see and do. Beautiful place for camping and trial walking. Mesmerizing forest . Nice and clean lake with sandy beach. Well maintained, beautiful beaches and excellent campsites and facilities. Our favourite Provincial Park for car camping. Rented hut for a family camping and checked out as soon as I got there due to pest infestations including cockroaches. Absolutely disgusting place. Lovely place to hang out at the beach, canoe,  bike, hike, xc ski,snowshoe or go camping. It's pretty reasonable drive from most of south/midwestern Ontario. Pretty great way to spend a day being active and in nature Camped here twice for the past 2 years and enjoys it every time! :) Went vamping there as a group. Really liked the experience, however there is plenty of room for improvement..
1. Instead of having vault toilets at the group camp sites, why don't they have decent washrooms and showers??? We have to ... Sunset in Pinery was a real beauty. It was dazzling. Fantastic area: whether you're looking to camp, kayak, swim or just explore nature..it has a little bit for everything for everyone. Lots of greenery and direct access yo Lake Huron. Just came back from the annual midsummer 4 day camping trip. One of our favorite parks for available amenities that are well kept on hourly schedule. We always stay at Burley as it is close to one of the beaches. Almost no mosquitos ... Great place - clean and comfortable amenities, the camp ground was close to the beach. We enjoyed our camping very much! Amazing place to swim, fish, kayak, hang out, and enjoy the beautiful nature of our country. Park is beautiful. it has all the facilities you can think ie flush toilet, bike rental, laundry, warm showers etc. Beach that goes for miles and miles (mind you it has little rocks so getting in and out is little issue but if you ... Was impressed. Bathrooms were clean and so was the park and beachs. Very beautiful place. 1st time there. Best provincial park in southern Ontario! The pinary was great place but make sure you take your credit card because lots of fines and extremely racist employees. The park rangers are very rude and have no respect for campers especially the ranger with the name B. Lane he was ... Perfect camping sites. Almost no mosquitoes. Nice beach, many trails to enjoy Great park to rent a canoe or a bike for an afternoon. Campsites are nice, but the park can become very loud and crowded in the summer.  Good location, close to Grand Bend. Great facilities and nature. We had some regrettable weather, but that was uncontrollable by the park. Will definitely return! I love this park. There is so much to do for everyone. I go mainly for the beach. Long shore line and most visitors are respectful of others. There is always that why guy who thinks it's ok to feed the seagulls. Over the years the shore ... Good place for camping, swimming, fishing and lots of water activities in the near by town eg parasail. Use to go here all the time as a kid. Great sand dunes and camping spots. Awesome dunes and beach. Exvellent camp sites. Staff ensured cleanliness and peace and quiet throughout the day & night. This place is always awesome. Best enjoyed with just adults. Love Pinery. Only reserved their Yurts and cabin though. Spacious campgrounds, good amenities, washrooms with showers, reasonable rates and all sorts of trails and outdoor activities to be enjoyed here. A decent beach with impressive sunsets. Always loved this place.   Still do. Nice place to camp. Will go again. Best camping setup IMHO. Great sites, great selection of things to do. Stayed there since 2002 at least 10 times, and want to go again! Love the hiking trails and the bike rides. The beach is good, and the water goes shallow for a long distance, very safe for kids to play. Great little dog beach. However, the dog beach is only marked on the map. It is the first parking lot for beaches you come across, and since there are no signs, sometimes families unwittingly go into the dog beach and get mad at dog owners. It would be beneficial to post actual signs, I think. It is a family resort. Biking, kayaking, and swimming on the beach. It's a place I just want to go back to. Great for the family. Our dogs loved it. Very nice walking trails and a great place to enjoy the beach. Favorite trail was the Carolinian. We stayed here last August, had fun. Camp site and bathrooms were clean. They have many activities to do like, Paddle boats, kayaking, canoeing... But the Con was the beach was really rocky!  That was a big disappointment for our family. We had to drive into town to go to the beach. Favourite park to visit every year with my family....very clean and lots to do. Great park.  Been coming with my family for 13+ years.  Beautiful Ausable river.  Great for fishing, stand up paddleboarding, canoeing, and kayaking.  This year we took our kayaks to the beach to kayak in Lake Huron. The beaches are ... One of the best provinciale park, large campground with long Beach area. I can't say enough good things about this provincial park. They have so many great trails to hike, the beach is beautiful, the campsites are plentiful and if you choose the right areas you aren't in your neighbors personal space. Great camping. Well cared for and lots of amenities. Beautiful beaches. Great park camp here yearly. I'd recommend renting a canoe or kayak for the afternoon as well. Perfect place to bring your pups to the beach.  Well-managed park with options to camp, canoe, cycle or simply relax. Always a great place for a day visit or a car camping trip. Some of the best sunsets in Southwestern Ontario. One of Ontario's most beautiful gems. Great spot for epic sunsets on the beach and nestled between forrest and sand dunes. 10 minute drive to Grand Bend and about a 35 minute drive from London. Be sure to book your spot early, this park fills up fast. For good reason! This has been our favourite park for more than ten years . Great very beautiful park with an excellent beach and great camping areas. Bathrooms are outstanding for a camping area and kept very clean. Bring bugspray as there are a lot of ticks in this area. My favorite Beach. I have to go here at least once a year. Gorgeous beach! Campsites could use some work so that it's easier to maneuver into them with Rigs. We had a very peaceful and invigorating stroll out to the Lake Huron shoreline on the Cedar Trail. You can't beat Pinery for well groomed trails, scenic vistas, and communing with nature. The oak savannah ecosystem and dunes are must sees. The camping is great too. Big and clean nature provincial park. We love this place. Love love love it ❤️it’s beautiful clean and safe ! 
What more could you want. 
Can’t wait to go back.... Pinery Provincial Park effectively acts as a small haven for those looking to get away from the day to day hustle and bustle of life.  Once inside, I quickly realized that the Park is much larger than it appears to be.  Among it's ... Always great! Take our dogs there every summer a few times! So worth the drive and the money!!! Always a favourite spot to take loved ones Stupendous provincial park with an equally amazing beach. Sand dunes for days.... Amazing Beach, nice facilities, and big campsites!!! Lots of activities to do-- campimg, hiking, canoeing and biking. There is a bike n canow rental shop in the parks as well. It was a wonderful place to be . sad I had to leave it today Always been my favourite spot to visit since my childhood ... I will always enjoy myself here Camped at The Pinery for 13 years straight and was never disappointed. Clean facilities, helpful and knowledgeable Naturalists/ park staff. Interpretive center and programs are always enjoyable and educational. Love this park ⛲🌳🎡 If I could, Pinery would get a MILLION stars. From when you arrive, you are greeted by warm, welcoming and helpful staff who will set you up with everything you need. They will clearly show your way to the campsite, and answer and ... Really nice water, clean and decent beach. Reason for 3star because the distance from where you park and the water is about 10 minutes of walk which can be very exhausting especially on the hot day that you want to go to the beach. Best park ever!  I used to backcountry camp when I was younger and so I was quite snobbish about the whole camping experience.  Now that I'm older and have a teenaged son and a travel trailer, the Pinery is like the Bahamas in Ontario to ... Most beautiful beach in Ontario. Don't tell anyone! Our family has gone to pinery every year since we first found it 6 years ago.  They offer programs for young children to learn about nature and the area.  Guided hikes at different times and great beaches.  You will need to walk or drive a bit as the camp is huge.  It's also one of the cleanest camps I've ever stayed. It was beautiful. Went during Easter weekend and felt like perfect sweater weather. Recommend using their new yurts. Love it.no bears😉🙄 but I go only in June before it is full.. peaceful then.lots of nature wandering around to see..wild turkeys and the little turketts Great park for camping or day use Park is great, beach, hike,bike...all outside is amazing...
When for a day and planning camping. Nice campground but beach is all stones and drift wood. Great park, and facilities but they need to fix the roads! Beautiful park but most of the sites are not very private. Winter yurt CAMPING..  very pretty . Went there with my family and my brothers family we has a good time Great park.  Very beautiful and also very clean. The best place to be in touch with nature and wildness. Very fun and awesome Most of the time restrooms were clean way to much poison ivy everywhere.  Not a bad experience Too many campsites which are very close to each other. Even the private campsites are not very private.  Facilities are not enough for the number of visitors. The beaches are narrow and rocky. Nice place for camping. Close to lake Grew up camping at Pinery, and now camping there with my own kids! Beautiful place. You definitely need bug sprays even on the beach. I love this place. Take me back. Kind of pricey but some nice trails. The dog beach is great Nice park ......but infested with poison ivy ....and dead trees and branches everywhere ...... ridiculous!!!  Place needs a good clean up !!! My second time camping, it was only for 1 day but had a great time, staying longer next time 😊 It is my favourite provincial park in Ontario. You will have an amazing time with your family and friends. It has many great activities within the park, the beach is very nice, clear and clean water. The picnic areas are wonderful even for a day's visit. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Went in winter. The XC skiing was excellent. Great place to learn, the trails run from pan flat to fairly flat. The yurt was nice, warm, bright, but they are not all the same. Warm showers and washrooms. Love the Pinery! They have the nicest beach around! Beautifull beaches. Don't get lost on you way out. Hahaha Easy hiking trails. A great place for family camping and day visits. Nice park. Always a good time. awesome park and beautiful view for sunset near the beach. Love it and will come again A great family weekend destination. Dog friendly.

Just dont park where you shouldnt , you will get a ticket lolTHE SUNSETS ARE LEGENDARY. Nice in the off season but way to much 💰 and busy in the summer. Very nice camp but some sites are too far from the beach. Need to put more signs with directions on the roads, got lost while was looking for a registration point. This place is amazing! Most campsites are spacious being private to semi-private. The park offers a wide variety of water activities, such as canoeing, paddle-boarding, and a few other water crafts. Unfortunately, in the recent years, ... Beautiful park, excellent amenities, beautiful stoney beach. Removed a star for wood roaches. Pinery is the place to go for a summer weekend.

There's a trail that goes around the entire park which you can drive through and have a nice slow scenic drive. 

There's also various beach access points, day picnic areas, and its only about a 10 ... One of our favourite annual camping spots! Nice place but disappointed in lack of dog beach access. If going there with dog ask first about dog beaches. Fun experience!  Definitely check the weather before going. Super cold and windy the day I went, but still gorgeous.  Deer just walked by us while we were on certain trails. Definitely going to try cross country skiing! Really nice provincial park.  There are so many trails to hike and things to do.  Our stay was very quiet. The beach is fairly rocky and my kids liked to go look for stones and fossils. The dunes are quite neat and different than most other parks I have been to. Planning to stay again longer next year. The best even in a thunderstorm..maybe even better... Super pretty place always been a huge fan of the pinery it’s absolutely beautiful I love staying here because I love fishing! Love it.

Everyone had a great time, no negatives
Lots of trails, helpful staff, lots of things to do Just went the other day for the first time. It was very nice. Trails to walk and bike. We were at site 9 at the beach. Picnic tables available and the beach was nice and enjoyable for the little ones. Also the water is shallow which is great if you have toddlers Great park, with great camping but it's super busy and it would be nice if staff would clean up the trails. It's the best getaway to nature in the area but not worth traveling to It is a nice park to enjoy during the summer One of the best summer destinations in SWO! We went camping here and they had incredible facilities. The dunes were great for the kids. Beautiful forest, great view of the lake. Good for bird watching Nice place not sure why some are crying about insect infestation you should go stay in  a Hampton hotel lmao anyways just beautiful no other words dont be discouraged because of some highty tighty comments :) Largest campground in Ontario.

Great place to camp, good sites and beach Great place for camping, paddling, biking. Beach is very rocky. Very family friendly One of the best beach and water in my opinion Beach is nice. Lot of stones on the beach though. Our favourite spot to camp. Great spot for hiking, biking and kayaking. They rent bikes, kayaks, paddle boats, canoes for the people that don't have them. Beautiful sunsets. There is poison ivy and ticks you need to educate your kids not to go into the bushes I like to refer to The Pinery Provincial Park as the Outer Banks of the Great Lakes. We like camping there that much. There are dunes near shore. The beaches are rarely all that crowded. The water is beautiful. And, the people seem to be more civilized than many others who camp and RV. Great place to visit cant wait to go back Great dog beach, beautiful trails, amenities accessible throughout the park A great time. Nice large and private campsites. The Beach is awesome if you like waves! Bring water shoes for the band of pebble on tge beach though if you can. They will annihilate the soles of your feet, which is always good comedic value. Had a great time here. Easy to find, easy to reserve a spot online, and had no problems while camping.

Super impressed with how clean their washrooms and showers are. Yes, they have hot showers here, you just have to let them warm up ... Amazing. Please check out the beach at night when there is no moon, stellar views This is a nice family getaway. Has lots of activities for children including biking, hiking, kayaking/canoeing. It's also a great place for wildlife watching. We saw several different birds and a turtle basking on a log while on the ... Amazing place super friendly staff :) Bought a season pass and enjoy walking my dog there Amazing spot to camp with wonderful sunsets. Lovely day at Pinery provincial park.

Walk through dunes ... Great place for families, beautiful wilderness. One of my favourite provincial parks.. A must visit if you visit grand bend beach 🌴. Usually less crowded than the beach and pretty long strech of sand. One of the best beaches in Ontario Great trails and beach Great park sites are large facilities are clean and well maintained.  Lots to do 10+ hike trails canoe and kayak rentals great to go biking.  One of the most popular parks so you need to book far in advance  Great park, over 1000 campsites. Make sure you book in advance as the campsite is always full.  
Park is about 10-15 minute drive to Grand Bend, (which also has a fantastic beach.)

Good campsites, clean washrooms and showers. 
Beautiful ... Great place!! Beautiful beaches Clean, large, campground.  The beach here is great.  Water shoes are recommended because there are lots of pebbles that can be a little rough on your feet. Great place to enjoy a bit of nature.

Ice cream place was yummy too!  beautiful park. lots of good hiking trails. looking forward to seeing it in the summer. We stayed in the Dunes and it's was beautiful!

Clean showers Awesome beaches, well kept facilities, shaded campsites. Great weather.  Nice campsite in Dunes 1. Site 63. The beach had more stones than I remember and 2 sand bars. Quiet. Fairly private.  Love Sept  weekend. Picnic,Boating and canoe 🛶 all in one what else do you want more !! Awesome campgrounds. Very clean bathrooms. Fantastic beach, many Kilometres long, most of it empty if you are willing to walk about five minutes from the car park. Nice campgrounds, but book ahead because they are always full.

Very tranquil at this time of yes, a quiet walk you might be surprised what you see 😉 Not bad Always relaxing, close to home One word...""BEAUTIFUL"" worth the money. Great camp site with clean facilities So far my favourite provincial park. The beach is the best in Ontario in my opinion, and there are very few biting bugs (usually too breezy or sandy for mosquitos!!) Always a beautiful, well kept Park. Staff are helpful and always helpful, if needed. The Visitors centre has a Tax Free gift shop with various items at reasonable prices. Another fine memory made. Highly recommend family vacation!

Love the beaches which are free of garbage.  So much to do hiking, canoing, biking and even Ice cream. We love ... Stayed in a park in mid of July and i had great time. All public amenities were clean and accessible. The big drawback was a rocky beach and flies. I couldn't just sit on a beach as flies were eating me alive and it was unbearable. Otherwise I highly recommend this place.  Beautiful park. Loved it Love it, come every year for a week.. Great family getaways at the Pinery Beautiful spot, had a few bad staffers but most were really great.  I won't let two bad eggs spoil the rating.

Had breakfast at the restaurant every morning, it was amazing!  Never have I done that while camping, but it was nice.

The water here is unbelievable, it's worth the visit. This campground is fantastic. Everything you need is available. Hiking. Canoe or kayaking. Right on Lake Huron, which to me, has magical properties in it. It makes you young again. Once you step in, you feel like a kid.  Awesome park!! Good stay so far Small sites and tons of poison ivy Great spot. Nice for BBQ or picnic right by the water since there are tables right by the water. I came for a day trip so I dunno about the camping area. Loved it. Highly recommanded when you wanna have a quit day on the beach. Sites are big and clean Best beach in Ontario!  Camping in the Dunes is primo location for tenting. Choose a site close to beach access. Miles of beach to stroll along. Bring your bike or hiking shoes to enjoy excellent trail system. Winter Camping in the yurts... so much fun!
Clean washrooms and yurts.
Lovely park. Very well kept facilities and a nice place to camp. Beware! Cockroaches and Ticks! I got bit by a dog tick first day I was there. Must've been when I was setting up the tent. So far no symptoms but I will see a doctor.  Didn't set the mood for sure. Next I noticed cockroaches crawling ... Wow! Great scenery and vistas of Lake Huron. You could see the glow of Cadet Bone Spur's hairpiece. Expensive day pass, but very nice park. Camp sites are large and they are not right next to other camp sites. Favourite place to go camping around Ontario. Clean campsite, clean washrooms and the beach was beautiful. Go to the park and camp. Take your kids with you and let them be closer to nature. Do the trails on foot or bike. Kayaking is also must. Don't forget family fishing. A week camping at the Pinery is barely enough to try a bit of everything the park has to offer. Well maintained campgrounds and camp-sites. Excellent services, friendly, helpful staff. Their facilities, location, bike trails, clean beaches, sandy beaches, proximity to Grand Bend, their icecream. Well maintained, family place, close to beach Lovely beaches and scenic drive for the day and great camping options too. Camp sites are shady, private and many are grassy and offer a good base for sleeping. Bring a pair of hard soled shoes for the beach (it's a bit rocky near/in the water). Very big site in Burley. Clean bathrooms Beautiful waters of Huron. Never had a mosquito bite me here. Great park. Very peaceful and well maintained park, with a beach and a lot of natural space. Did I mention the sunsets?

No place better in Ontario.  Some great campsite staff very helpful beware of wolves. Don't tape bacon to your pants Ok but too pricy for beach Love this park. Huge area, lots of hiking trails and wildlife and has 9 public beaches 2 which are dog friendly. Always busy with great camp store, nature centre and water for canoeing and paddle boats. Many kms of biking roads and trails. Wonderful place for families. If you want to vacation to a great beach with water at whatever depth you feel comfortable for kids and adults, then look no further. If i spend a couple days here its my quick cure for a Caribbean vacation Reasonable prices for kayaking. Needs to be more taken care off. The beach now sucks full of stones and not as nice water as before I have been camping at this park for over a decade with my family. It's our favorite park to camp at when we can actually get a site. Some sites have pretty decent privacy but many are very open with no privacy at all. Any on the nicer ... Beautiful place and great camping Best provincial park I've been going to the Pinery nearly every year since I was 6 and still get just as excited everything I go. Every time there is something new, wether it be spotting a bowfin slowly cruising beside your canoe or a scarlet tananger ... I trust our Government will take a firm hand to keep this park open to the general public and not let a few blackmail them into giving it up.  This seems to be a slippery slope where expectations continually increase as our government just throws dollars at the situation.  Case in point Caledonia. Got poison ivy... still had fun This place was chosen as my 2017 girl camping trip and we were all so happy that it was. This campground is very big, with 1000 spots yet it didn't feel claustrophobic. They kept the washrooms very very clean, with scheduled cleaning. The beach was spectacular, and the sunset is not to be missed!! Good beach times and great hike! Camped for a week with my ten year old.  There was something different to do every day.  We took advantage of most of the programs and really enjoyed them.  The nature centre was great to hang out at when it rained.  This park is good ... Amazing place with small but gorgeous private beaches,  much more family friendly than main beach in Grand Bend (although also great). 
Clean bathrooms and welcoming, renewed facilities. Very friendly staff and welcoming park. Love this park and it’s beaches Great camping Way too much poison Ivey Great place for camping and outdoor activities! Come here year after year solid place It is a great provincial park. Has amazing trails and it's one of the few open year-round for camping. Beautiful spot with plenty of space to explore! Clean bathrooms and camp sites. Best to bring water shoes as the shore is quite rocky. A great place to go for family camping. Staff keep the bathrooms in great shape. 

I recommend the alcohol-free weekends for a little more peacefulness. 

Poison Ivy is the only thing you have to watch out for here.  Really nice campground with great facilities Poison ivy is everywhere. The bane of campers!! A fun time at a great place. From the water it was awsome It's my first time visiting this park, i really loving it. Ticks Poison Ivy And cockroaches right at the camp site. Two weeks of recovery after petting the dog. Never again. What I learned... Read the reviews. Read the reviews! Always read the reviews, before taking any trip.  Nice park, great for camping or just day use of the beach area. Facilities are well maintained and the beach is clean, with waves. The fire pits are ideal for BBQ and campsites vary in size. A great provincial park by Lake Huron, and not a far drive from Grand Bend, ON. I camped here for 5 days and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Nice trails, amazing beach, lots of varied nature, didn't have a lot of bugs or animals really (which surprised me). A lovely campground, Best place for canoe... One of my favourite camping spots. I've been coming here for over 20 years now. The beaches are fantastic, the camp staff are amazing, kayaking the canal is always an adventure and the campsites are fairly well maintained.

The whole section is pretty good and it's off the main road, relatively far but close enough to the water and washrooms.  The whole section was pretty good even ... great cycling park. The staff were very professional and approachable. The washroom and bath facilities were always clean. There is a store within the park if you needed food at reasonable price.  I would stay all summer. Always lots to do. Park staff always friendly and helpful. Great camping spot! Must check it out. Good place for camping, but if you are not good at canoe, don't try it because they don't have any responsibility of your safety. My family was almost drowning the day before yesterday, but they were just watching us. They don't try to ... The kids had a lot of fun Clean park clean showers. Difficult to maneuver our 16ft trailer roads were narrow.  The sites were clean though. Would return. Was an absolute blast. And very beautiful trails. With great kayak, canoe, paddle boat and aqua bike rentals. Great place to camp A very beautiful provincial park with tons of trails to hike.  I just loved this place.

There is wide channel, steady water and plenty of wild life. Btw, they have nice sandy beaches as well. Pinery park is a beautiful place to spend some time.  The staff this season although good didn't seem to be as personable as past years.  The value is great, however rule and regulation enforcement often ruins family vacations.  Noise, ... With spacious campsites, well-maintained hiking + biking trails, and granular beaches, this provincial park is a prime nature enabler. 10/10 would recommend Amaizing place to be.

Plus they provide some walking tours and a few other events that you can go to.  The kids really liked the night hike.  The ... Great hiking trails and a dog beach! We drove over 2.5 hrs to Pinery from Brampton fir the day - where I now live with my girlfriend - to check out what our campsite looks like and the parks over all amenities. The facilities were well maintained, the park was very clean ... Great spot to bring your family. Bike and canoe rentals available. Lots of bike and walking trails It used to be a pleasure when our children where younger, there seems to be issues that turned us away.

Love it they have so much to do and supper friendly staff clean rest rooms  Beautiful park, great little river for people just getting started with canoeing, kayaking or stand up paddleboards.  Also home to a unique protected Oak Savanah ecosystem. CAMPERS BEWARE! Aside from staff being very unapproachable and useless. This facility is the training grounds for police brutality. As you might know it is ""patrolled"" by park rangers. Where they have the same authority on camp grounds ... Great sites with good extra programs for kids. Fairly clean bathrooms. Sunsets like california, fireflies at night, awesome showers, could use more privacy trees - all the campsites are basically in clusters.  Truly one of Canada's Best Attractions!  Beautiful Magnificent Mother Nature  Tons of fun & opportunities here in the summer.  Take a car-load, since a single person pays the same rate as a 7 passenger van-load.  There are a number of hiking/skiing trails, kayak & bicycle rentals, and tons to do for the whole family. Gerat place for everone....family friends.
.something to do for ever one Great place just want avoid it for any holidays gets a little crowded, awesome in the winter also!!  Amazing day trip with dog friendly beach area.

The kids have literally grown up coming here. Hiking trails, miles of beach, canoing, super clean bathrooms and showers. The campsites are large and private and sunsets on the beach (the shore of Lake Huron) are spectacular. No downside.  Fun place to spend a full day - swimming and other activities. We went without expecting much, we've been to Goderich, Sauble Beach and Port Elgin and pretty much enjoyed those visits as well. However The Pinery was different, the water level is really suited for small kids and you won't have to ... Pinery is still one of my favorites.

Who needs the ocean when you have the Pinery? A little piece of paradise in our backyard. Nice clean beach not crowded like the grand bend one. Spend the extra 2$ over parking and go here. Stunning Sunsets, the water is shades of  tropical teals like the ocean. Only con was the stoney beach. You need water shoes. The best. This park is being neglected... Garbage on the beach, roads that should be maintained, sites that should be cleaned up and poison ivy that is taking over the sites! It is so difficult to get a site because of how popular this park is, ... Best place to go for camping . Pinery is one of my favourite parks.
Beach is beautiful and with the dunes and high waves, it looks and feels like a sea.
Dunes campgrounds are the best, with large and private sites, new comfort stations and easy access to the lake.
Trails are nice too, especially the bike trail.
Fish Fry, by friends of Pinery, is a must! My fav beach! Beautiful, clean and peaceful.

The park is huge and a lot of the roads are one way, so if you miss a turn you have to take the long way around. Great park for camping with lots to do: biking, swimming, canoeing, and  hiking.  A convenient store is on site that carries most of the necessity you need. The best place for camping with access to river and huge lake Huron and exellent forest area Love the pinery.

Check friends of pinery for guided tours and canoeing is recommended Really huge park with a variety of things to do. As a day visitor, my experience was great. There are multiple types of bikes and watercraft you can rent within the pinery for inexpensive prices. The beach is long but very narrow. Not as much sand to water space as the grand bend main beach. Beautiful Park! They also have a dog friendly beach. Beautiful park, one of the nicest in the area.

We enjoyed the park. facilities were well kept.  Everything was clean.  park staff were good. Great views, great campsites. Amazing for family trips. I'd recommend staying away from busier months though. I know the Wikipedia description describes this place as small. - I would disagree.

Quiet and beautiful time to visit. Love this place Took my dog here, he liked it. It's meh. Got lost while getting to the campsite from the main entrance. The beach isn't the best either. But it's enough to have a decent experience. The river is alright for short distance kayaking/canoeing. Water is very green. Long distance kayaking/canoeing sucks.

The beach supposedly available to campers only is now invaded by all kinds of nosy crowds    I've been to many PP over the years, this was my first time at Pinery. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the park and the efficiency of check-in with multi check in points.

However the sites are small, I feel like your waking up to being on your neighbors site. If this was all that was available than I would go back, but there are definitely better parks in Ontario. It’s a nice park. It would have been better if that Maynard guy wasn’t there trying to convince people that his grandfathers campfire story means the park is his but oh well, there’s always someone trying to get something for nothing. I’ll visit again for sure, when they get it all sorted and kick that guy out. Loved the experience for renting canoe/kayaks, dog beach, biking around the wooded forest and the ice cream is delicious! It’s definitely car camping though and can be a bit crammed for my liking. We are more into backpacking and tried ... Too many memories too call this an unbiased review, but this place is amazing.  The environment, the trails, the sights, and the sounds of this park are amazing.  I can’t recommend this place any more.  The ultimate escape is just laying ... Such a beautiful amazing camping park. There aren’t many parks that have so many trees as Pinery! I am happy we got a site right beside the bathroom as some of the sites are really far from bathrooms. The bathrooms were really clean! We are going to go in the summer so we can check out the beach! Excellent place for camping and activities. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. It was quite and natural. Biking trail is great. Beaches are serene, could be dangerous due to current. Loved the walk in the dunes. Beautiful park on Lake Huron. Great big sandy beaches (some gravelly patches, but generally sandy). Campsites are private and comfortable. Comfort stations are well spaced and lots of things to do. Three different ecosystems throughout ... A big provincial park with huge beaches and pretty decent camp site sizes. Beautiful sunsets everyday, but one has to watch for poison ivy especially in the dark. Often had cell phone service throughout the park so was able to coordinate ...

There is bike rentals, canoe rental and good ice cream shop across the general store within the park in the center. ... Absolutely adore this place.

The first time we visited this park it had all beautiful sandy beaches, but ... Probably our favourite Ontario park. Plenty to do for the kids, excellent beach, superb trails and lots of tree cover.

The drive just going into the beach is stunning but the trails are just as gorgeous!
Love this beach and park!!! I What a great park! The park is extensive, well forested and set along the eastern shore of Lake Huron. 
The campsites are attractive, large, private, and with many trees and bushes between the sites. I was in the ""Dunes"" area which is ... Great place, the camping grounds were clean and firewood provided (though you should bring your own)

Lots of benches for a group site, washrooms not too far and very well taken care of, and close enough to get to the beach, while being a short drive from the main grand bend strip. Will definitely be coming back Love this place. It's perfect place for an escape. Huge park with lots of hiking tracks and various options for beaches. Love coming here for swimming and day trips. The water is cleaner than the main Beach in grandbend and not as ... My wife loves the Pinery. Now bringing the grandkids. In a yurt this year and find it very comfortable. Great beaches, clean facilities, many fun programs. We have found other campers friendly and considerate. You do need a car to get to ... Yurt are beautiful and we'll taken care of but way to close together! They need more privacy! Best beach in South Ontario.  Book in advance.  Fascinating nature centre.  Winter camping.  Cycling trails.  Beautiful. 2 words; the beach. Having the ability to go swim all day for $17 a car is absolutely worth it at this incredible provincial park. We were able to enjoy a busy beach that didn't feel crowded at all WITH OUR DOG!! The fact that they allow dogs on their amazing beach makes this my favourite beach in Southern Ontario. Just as beautiful in the winter for walks as in the summer only quieter you almost have the place to yourself. Hikes and  cross-country skiing in the beautiful untouched snow covered forests.

Great place for hiking, biking and swimming. We booked riverside camping and got really good size of camping site with power and privacy.

Having said that, I would have given five stars for ... The family loves this place. Always a great time and they have spots in the winter for us hard core campers. Thanks. Beautiful beach with tons of space. Campsites are huge and the water is so nice but some of the beaches have a lot of rocks. Make sure to grab an icecream on your way out. Always enjoyed camping here, not a fan of the rock beaches though. Cool place, i only stayed one night but definitely need to go back, there's a network of small rivers that would be Great yo explore paddling and trails that would be great to walk or bike. Nice provincial park. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Beaches are nice. This is a very busy park. There are alot of sites so they are quite varied in privacy and size. Park layout is pretty confusing for a 1st timer and signage isn't the ... We had a great stay here. The weather was rainy but we made the best out of it and it is a nice park.

The weather was great and the ice cream was delicious. The only issue is when we arrived at the pinery. It took us an hour just to fill up with water. Because everybody is in the same line. People dumping and ... One of my favourite parks in Ontario. There are other ones that are amazing but I just love The Pinery. It is excellent for biking, great ice cream place, the dunes are amazing and superb beach... Of  course it's different from Algonquin or Killarney but it has its own beauty and it is one of my top ones!!! Always love the Pinery ....spring fall ams winter when it's not too busy ! Quiet at this time of the year. Great place for a walk in the woods, and a snack by the shoreline. Overall the experience at Pinery Provincial Park was good. The only problem was that the smaller washrooms did not have any light in the washroom, thus making it really hard to use it at night time. Also please keep the washroom clean ... AMAZING place!!! We go every summer with our family friends.

The dunes are definitely the gem of the place as well as the incredible sunsets in the quiet evenings. They also have a cool community center and a variety of outdoor sports. Overall, a great place to spend the summer away from the city. One of our favourite places to go every year! Really gorgeous sites and amazing beaches. What a amazing place to take the family. Biking trails, amazing ""sea like"" Beach, canoe /bike rentals. Comfort stations with showers everywhere. Even their ""outhouses"" have flush toilets. Quite up scale for camping. Great  park.  Was searching for open ground to play Cricket but couldn't find one. Beach was excellent although there was challenge  in finding parking at beach and that Enforcement officers were not patrolling Beach parking spots ... Pretty special place to visit- great scenery lots to do for the kids great beach and trails too. 

Only down side is the behaviour of some people who visit the park.  Littering drinking on the beach.  Last visit had a bunch of kids ... The largest park in Ontario. Check out the weekly events. We loved the nature walk at night This is the premiere family camping in Southwestern Ontario. It's great car camping with lots of trails and for hiking and biking.
But, by far, the beaches on Lake Huron are the draw here. If you can, make the trek to the day beaches on ... New yurts were amazing.  You can now see the stars from your bed. Was here on Wednesday.  Was there in the morning with my mom, sister and dog for canoeing.  My mom and I had taken our dog canoeing last year in September and she was good with it so we decided to do it again.  We had to buy a day pass ... One of the best parks to go camping. The dunes campgrounds are great and in close proximity to the lake and river. Plenty of activities to keep you busy. They also have canoe/kayak rentals. Lots of trails to go exploring and overall great atmosphere It's alright but not my favourite park. Nice long trails for biking. Nice river for fishing. Beaches at dunes are pretty good. 

Always busy. 
I get poison ivy every year I go.
 It's everywhere. Stay away from the brush around your site. ... Great park, well maintained. Sites are slightly close to each other, some have more space and trees between them than other. The beach is great, once you get past the rocks on the way in. But that is indicative of that lake. Comfort stations and bathrooms are updated and clean. The beach area was crowded. Me and my friends wanted to stay on a shaded area nearest to the path to our campsite but other people who were in that area told us we couldn't because there was a lot of us. We had children who needed the ... One of the nicest parks you could visit. Plenty of activities to keep busy with. Great campground with lots to do like fishing, swimming in the lake, canoeing, kayaking, trail walking. Went to the dog friendly beach section and had an awesome time. The sun wasn't too harsh so the water was a bit cold..many pebbles at the shoreline made it painful to get into the water though. Washrooms had several tiny flies. Overall a beautiful breathtaking place! Fantastic time.... except for the little wood roaches... We didn't have any come home with us but I also think they probably want to stay there... They have a pretty sweet set-up. This is one of my favourite places! It's a fairly large park and covers a lot of different terrain.  While the beaches (of which there are both very accessible beaches and more remote, private beaches) are probably the biggest draw, ... The Pinery is gorgeous!! There is a ton of flora and fauna here, especially all the beautiful birds to be seen! The boardwalk to the beach offered a spectacular view, and the trails were a lot of fun to walk along. Be prepared for a) ... We went last week for 5 days, it was great. This provincial park is officially my favorite park. It’s summer so it was busy, lots of people for a weekday but this park feels like you have your own world. The beach is so long that even if ... Always a great stay at Pinery. Dunes #4 was quiet and sites clean and spacious.
Bike rides and kayaking and hiking... beautiful sunset. This park is great for car camping. It is easily accessible and full of comfort stations. The beach is super long and the sand dunes (a rare ecosystem in Ontario) are stunning. Then only thing more stunning in this park are the sun sets. This park is a must visit! Large Provincial Park in Granf Bend. The park has campgrounds spread over different wooded areas. Clean washrooms and showers, an amphitheatre, visitors centre, trails, bird watching, camp store, kayak and bike rentals make this a very ... Had an amazing time! I wish I could post pictures, but I was living more in the moment and decided to let my phone die instead. Sounds archaic, but it was actually really nice not to feel reliant on technology. We were at Riverside at ... It's a beautiful park on Lake Huron with large and fairly private campsites. The public washrooms and showers were clean and easily accessible. The staff helpful and friendly. It's a very popular park so reservations are a good idea, particularly on week ends. What a beautiful place. The yurts are larger then the yurts at MacGregor. One concern is the state of the washrooms at the end of the weekend. The Pinery is a lovely place to spend the summer. My family and I are going up for a few weeks, and we are looking forward to having an enjoyable stay. Some things that appeal to us particularly are the many beaches and fun activities to ... Amazing park to go camping! I stayed in the Burley camp grounds and my site was super close to the beach. The beach had a brilliant view of the sunset and sunrise. I would recommend taking your car and parking near the beach as walking a ... Beautiful park, very busy and because the park is popular, your neighbours may not be the greatest. Customer experience may vary The Pinery is a fantastic park. Everyone that I've spoken to has the same experience: Terrific!

The washrooms are clean, the staff are friendly, the park store area is HUGE with tons of options (from bike rentals to boat rentals to ice ... Had a great time despite it pouring rain when we first arrived. Stayed at a site in Dunes 3. The site was spacious and private. It had a campfire ring and a picnic table. Everything was in good condition. The beach was less than five minute walk away. Would recommend as a good getaway for a weekend. Everything is very used and could use updating but we enjoyed our stay. Beautiful huge park with really nice campsites. Lake huron beach is a little rocky but nice clean water to swim in. A great place to camp and swim. If you are staying in Riverside you will need a car or bike to get to the beach (it is a bit of a haul). This place is a nice place to spend time with good people. Out of the provincial parks in Ontario this is one of the nicer ones. One of the best beaches I have been to.
10K beach and everything was clean and awesome.

Highly recommend It's a very nice place. One of the biggest in North America as I read. It has forest and lake.
 I could see that the camping lots are very close to each other though. 
The signs could also be better, it wasn't easy to find some of the ... This is a beautiful provincial park with many facilities available on site. There is a campsite which has electricity available, along with showers and bathrooms. This park is about a ten minute drive from Grand Bend Beach, which is a very good location. Washrooms are kept clean, staff are always around cleaning and the beach is amazing. The province does a great job up-keeping this property and keeping it very natural. Great for campers, and even for just a day. Highly disappointed. First campground,  EVER, that we have been denied access to view campsites so we could plan an upcoming camping trip.  Wanted to charge us $17 just to take a quick look. The area itself looks awesome and inviting, so we can't give nature a bad review, just the rangers. Well maintained and one of the best in Ontario for biking. Beautiful beach and trails. Don't forget the ice cream shop!!! Park store has pretty much everything you may need or forget to bring for your camp. Pretty much the best park in Southern Ontario....

After 30 years of tolerating poorly designed, old and impossible to clean comfort stations..... comfort station #5 in Dunes is a prime example of a logical, comfortable and green design... One of the most beautiful Provincial park there is an all of Ontario, the forest looks like something out of a fairy tale and the park has a great amount of space to always feel very in nature. BBQs and picnic tables are usually provided ... Awesome place, clear water at the beach, great temperature as well. The Park is big, well preserved, worth going back. Lots of space for camping, walking or biking on the trails. Boat and bike rentals, and also some food options in the central visitors center. Great place but infested with ticks. 5 out of 8 of us got bit over the weekend and one person was infected with Lyme disease. Be aware! Very nice park. Lots of hiking and great beach, looks like the ocean. Some canoeing but really limited to the 5 km in the park unless you go out onto lake huron Great dog beach. Sites aren't huge but turquoise Lake Huron and the sunsets more than make up for it. Kids love the ice cream shop and the store is large and convenient. Extremely scenic and less busy than Grand Bend. The day use fee is about the same as you would pay to get parking in Grand Bend, and it is much more private. The first four feet of water has rocks, but it is all sand the rest of the way. ... It is very nice place for family with kids, we go there almost every summer. Great Park! Coming here with kids for sixteen years! The park is very well maintained. Each day there are interesting educational programs for kids of any age. Thanks, Pinary, for the amazing time! Wonderful place to spend a day with the family. Lots of great outdoor opticians and good camp grounds. I love Grand Bend, the beach is beautiful. The park is always clean and the flusable toilets at the beach are a bonus.  Would definitely recommend the yurts, they are very spacious and clean.  Great staff, always friendly and helpful.  Also the restaurant and ice cream store are a big bonus. Great place to get away from it all. Even if its just for a day Great clean sites.  Clean facilities.  Great beach! Loved our weekend visit! This is one the best campsites that I have been in Ontario.  It's a big park. No mosquitoes.  But lots of flies and lots of lots of sand roaches. I was very worried to bring them home but apparently they do not live out of wild life. 
Beach is a sandy one but also lots of rocks. Love the Pinery! It's small compared to other parks but always well kept. We camp here at least once a season ans visit with a day pass a couple times a year. The park ranger who goes by the name b. Lane was very confrontational and looks to be racist. My friends say they call this place finery provincial park because they seem to fine you all the time and we witnessed that and now know why. ... Always enjoy The Pinery Provincial Park.  Great spot for camping, whether in a tent or trailer they have sites that are secluded or open depending on your preference. 
This park boasts an amazing beach that stretches for miles so there's ... Amazing place for camping during long weekends, one of my favourite provincial parks. Make sure you book ahead as it books up months in advance! Loved this place. Lots of rentals for canoes for paddle boats. Great prices.  Lots of beaches a d dog friendly beaches.  Really enjoyed the day here. Actually, I give it 4.5 stars:
5 stars for the campgrounds. We stayed at Burley, the furthest one from the park office. The sites are capacious, each with a picnic bench and a fire pit. Plenty of very clean washrooms with toilets and ... Washroom is not much clean. Beautiful views Love the Pinery! Hiking, canoeing, fishing, swimming beach days etc. Plus all the programming they have available - what isn't to like???! The kids had a blast, and the sandy soil makes for dry campsites when it rains! Just need to be careful to avoid the poison ivy! Great sites for a provincial park..Thanksgiving weekend we ended up have a lot more privacy but a full campground would mean less privacy..that being said site 243 we stayed at is as private you can get in a provincial park campground. Great time!  I love all the extra activities for kids, even in the rain I didn't hear ""I'm bored"".  Great sites and friendly staff.  Definitely recommend. One of the most beautiful provincial park in Ontario. Absolutely hands down a must for anyone into camping.  If you can get a site in the dunes you're set.  Quick walk to the beach and unbelievable swimming for kids.  Just watch out for rhe coons, had one sitting beside me when I started composing this review (no joke lol) Surprisingly there were no mosquitoes when we camped. Had a nice little trail behind campsite that lead to the dunes and an isolated but fairly rocky beach. Daytime beach was sandy. We went there on a very windy day and had a great old time in the sea-like waves. This is a park that you need more than a weekend to explore.  Its massive and beautiful.   Be cautious if hauling a camper bc some of the corners are tight and we got wedged between two trees ripping off our awning. Probably one of the best stocked parks out there, however it's always packed in the summer so if you're looking for a quiet getaway this won't be the place for you.  Dog friendly on day beach two is always a hit for me. I love pinery provincial park. My third time here and I like it even more than before. It has all you want in a park: river, beach, bike, canoe, ... Rental and nice trails. It has s close to great bend where you can find good ... It's so great that they have a beach where you can swim with your dog. And the kids had a lot of fun jumping and rolling around on the massive sand dunes by the dunes camping area. Nice park but has become jammed with people. Year after year our favorite! 
Love the campsites at Dunes 1and 2.
Nice, large and private. 
The comfortstations are clean and well set up.
Awesome beach, trails, river and oportunities for kids to explore nature. I know it was late in the season (Oct) but I wish the shop was still open. Otherwise, always a great stay at the pinery. Love love love this park. Feel blessed it's so close to home! Magical place to camp and beautiful place to hike. We plan on canoeing on our next trip there in the early Fall. Our campsite was spacious and privacy was good. All sites come with a fire pit with grill. Plenty of hardwood firewood and ... We have come here all of our lives. Lots of camping and just beach days. We have never had a problem with cockroaches, until this year! They were everywhere in all of the campgrounds and even at the ice cream picnic tables! I feel bad ... We love camping here. All the facilities you may need are available (toilets, hot showers, laundry, etc). Lake Huron is beautiful! Fantastic place and staff very professionally run, lovely campsites and Canoe & Kayaks rental, for those hanging tarps over tents to keep cool and dry, the trees can be well spread out so bring 100ft of rope per tarp to tie off the 4 ends, each of the fire pits also has a flip over grate for cooking which is handy Clean park with clean water by the lake. BBQ facility available, in the great outdoors. 10 km of greenery. Perfect for a family weekend Stayed 4 days at Riverside campground @ Pinery. Sites were very small and right next to the roadways. Washrooms were not kept very clean or stocked. Yellow cockroaches everywhere and i mean everywhere, into everything. Only positives are ... This park has everything. Camping, Canoeing, Bicycling, Trails, Beach, Great Lake. Grand Bend is only 15 mins away where lot of water sport activities are available and decent restaurants as well. Always a great place to camp or RV, great sites, lots to see and do and clean facilities. Was not good and relaxing this time. The site with 10 young punks was so loud. Kept all 6 kids up till 2 am. Reported to pinery staff. They kind of said would take care of it. Hardly believe they fined them for that noise complains. Wish it would be taken better for convinient stay of all families. 👎 If your wallet is holding you from the beaches of the Caribbean, then i should say we can still settle with Pinery Provincial Park  
The waters are warm n peaceful crowd surrounding you. There is a special beach for family with pets. Beaches are narrow depending upon the tides. Bring your umbrella. Great place to come and unwind. Hit the beach or kayak the river or hike one of many trails or relax at camp. Pinary has everything an outdoor enthusiast would love. I always enjoy coming here. Great walking trails and good camp sites. Great family camping as well with wood trucks that drive back to sell to you if you need more. Bathroom and showers close at hand. 
They have decent sound limits at night to accomodate other campers. Overall it is a clean fun campsite close to Grandbend. Always a great place to experience nature anytime of the year Great place to camp. Lots of things to do. I only wish they enforced the dog on leash rule. Several times I was going for a walk with my kids and our dog and an unleashed dog rushed out from a campsite. Love this campground. Spent another Thanksgiving and wouldn't want to spend it anywhere else Fun camp ground. Biggest downside is one that probably can't be helped, but it is the poison ivy. Every time we go, all of my kids get it and it has to be treated. We love to camp here a couple times each year.  Great family trips.  Bike, beach, canoe, fish, no playground equip for the kiddos though. Clean water, levelled surface which is safe for kids, less bugs, rocks and people which make your experience far superior compared to other crowded beach. Entry fee is $17, you will be surprised to drive 13-14 Kms to get and out of park. So big and lots of things to do. It's a beautiful park with lots to do. Miles of hiking and biking, gorgeous visitor's centre, a restaurant, fantastic camp sites, tons of beaches. The only downside is the beaches are much more rocky now compared to several years ago, wear sandals. Wonderful park that has gotten far too busy. One of our favourite places close to home. Never changes. Natural beauty. Loved our stay here. Staff keep the park nice and clean. We will be back for sure! Great experience and facilities manned by knowledgeable, energetic staff! A large park with 3 camp grounds and some beautiful stoney beaches, trails and lots of other fun things to do - canoeing/kayaking. Great Park for families or couples that like outdoor activities. Have been going there every year for past 15 years. Highly recommended. Great camp ground, clean, lots of activities. Offers bike and canoe rentals and we'll maintained hiking paths. Well groomed beach, and a offers a dog beach as well. Location and facilities are great, the services such as canoe rentals are still as good as ever, however it does get very busy here, the day use beaches (on the long weekend especially) get super packed. Beautiful! Nice camp sites and gorgeous beach. Some ants and poison ivy but still worth going A very well maintained massive park. We are so lucky to spend time here Best provincial park I've ever been too! One of my favorite camping spots Very nice place to visit/camp. Nice beach! What a beautiful place to come even just for a bike ride...well worth a visit I've been camping here multiple times and I am never disappointed. The camp ground is beautiful, trails are well maintained and the beach is breathtaking! Always a great time at the provincial park that caters to the family.  One of our favourites when we don't want to fight Toronto or Hwy 400 traffic. Had a great time during Thanksgiving with my family. Sites were a modest size and private to where other campers didn't feel intrusive, lots to do and beautiful scenery. Nice park, Clean, Great beach. Love camping near lake huron. Beautiful. Saw 2 Deer and 2 Cranes. There was a Hawk and plenty of Bullfrogs. Water was murky where we were because it is a little inlet. Very clean. Must pay $5 to park. Here is the little cabin we rented. 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. One of the most beautiful Parks in Ontario! At this time of year sooo peaceful! Great family time at a huge park with tons to do! Very easy to get lost. Signage is terrible. Their maps don't help much.    Lots of really bad pot holes. Shower water is extremely hot. It's been hot but good. Only complaint is the shut down of things like the visitor centre during the week. Same thing in Bon Echo on June. Even shorter hours would ok but just because we are in the park mid week doesn't mean that everything should start shutting down. Great place for summer family camping!  Lots of activities and an amazing beach with clear waters. Maybe not the best looking beaches, but very nice park. Nice bicycle path and nice smooth river to canoe/kayak on. Great off-leash dog beach. Wish the day parking passes were cheaper. I’d come more often. Loved our time at this park! The beach was wonderful, water was warm and site was in a great location! One of the nicest Ontario parks we have stayed at. It is huge, 1000 plus sites..... The beach is superb. Great place to go with the family or with friends! Super nice.  Lots to do. Very clean.. Beautiful park! Beach is clean and goes on for miles, great spot to swim and go camping Great place to visit with family. Nice beach, canoe and bike rental, and clean washrooms. I also likes the ice cream stall. LOVE THIS PLACE!! The water is warm clean and so pretty. The beach is amazing and even the dog beach is super clean. There are tons of things for kids to do. And also the sunsets are so pretty. If you like to camp you will love this place I proposed here, it's the most popular park in Ontario, canoes, rivers, beaches, pines. Love this place. Lost to see and do. Beautiful place for camping and trial walking. Mesmerizing forest . Nice and clean lake with sandy beach. Well maintained, beautiful beaches and excellent campsites and facilities. Our favourite Provincial Park for car camping. Rented hut for a family camping and checked out as soon as I got there due to pest infestations including cockroaches. Absolutely disgusting place. Lovely place to hang out at the beach, canoe,  bike, hike, xc ski,snowshoe or go camping. It's pretty reasonable drive from most of south/midwestern Ontario. Pretty great way to spend a day being active and in nature Camped here twice for the past 2 years and enjoys it every time! :) Went vamping there as a group. Really liked the experience, however there is plenty of room for improvement..
1. Instead of having vault toilets at the group camp sites, why don't they have decent washrooms and showers??? We have to ... Sunset in Pinery was a real beauty. It was dazzling. Fantastic area: whether you're looking to camp, kayak, swim or just explore nature..it has a little bit for everything for everyone. Lots of greenery and direct access yo Lake Huron. Just came back from the annual midsummer 4 day camping trip. One of our favorite parks for available amenities that are well kept on hourly schedule. We always stay at Burley as it is close to one of the beaches. Almost no mosquitos ... Great place - clean and comfortable amenities, the camp ground was close to the beach. We enjoyed our camping very much! Amazing place to swim, fish, kayak, hang out, and enjoy the beautiful nature of our country. Park is beautiful. it has all the facilities you can think ie flush toilet, bike rental, laundry, warm showers etc. Beach that goes for miles and miles (mind you it has little rocks so getting in and out is little issue but if you ... Was impressed. Bathrooms were clean and so was the park and beachs. Very beautiful place. 1st time there. Best provincial park in southern Ontario! The pinary was great place but make sure you take your credit card because lots of fines and extremely racist employees. The park rangers are very rude and have no respect for campers especially the ranger with the name B. Lane he was ... Perfect camping sites. Almost no mosquitoes. Nice beach, many trails to enjoy Great park to rent a canoe or a bike for an afternoon. Campsites are nice, but the park can become very loud and crowded in the summer.  Good location, close to Grand Bend. Great facilities and nature. We had some regrettable weather, but that was uncontrollable by the park. Will definitely return! I love this park. There is so much to do for everyone. I go mainly for the beach. Long shore line and most visitors are respectful of others. There is always that why guy who thinks it's ok to feed the seagulls. Over the years the shore ... Good place for camping, swimming, fishing and lots of water activities in the near by town eg parasail. Use to go here all the time as a kid. Great sand dunes and camping spots. Awesome dunes and beach. Exvellent camp sites. Staff ensured cleanliness and peace and quiet throughout the day & night. This place is always awesome. Best enjoyed with just adults. Love Pinery. Only reserved their Yurts and cabin though. Spacious campgrounds, good amenities, washrooms with showers, reasonable rates and all sorts of trails and outdoor activities to be enjoyed here. A decent beach with impressive sunsets. Always loved this place.   Still do. Nice place to camp. Will go again. Best camping setup IMHO. Great sites, great selection of things to do. Stayed there since 2002 at least 10 times, and want to go again! Love the hiking trails and the bike rides. The beach is good, and the water goes shallow for a long distance, very safe for kids to play. Great little dog beach. However, the dog beach is only marked on the map. It is the first parking lot for beaches you come across, and since there are no signs, sometimes families unwittingly go into the dog beach and get mad at dog owners. It would be beneficial to post actual signs, I think. It is a family resort. Biking, kayaking, and swimming on the beach. It's a place I just want to go back to. Great for the family. Our dogs loved it. Very nice walking trails and a great place to enjoy the beach. Favorite trail was the Carolinian. We stayed here last August, had fun. Camp site and bathrooms were clean. They have many activities to do like, Paddle boats, kayaking, canoeing... But the Con was the beach was really rocky!  That was a big disappointment for our family. We had to drive into town to go to the beach. Favourite park to visit every year with my family....very clean and lots to do. Great park.  Been coming with my family for 13+ years.  Beautiful Ausable river.  Great for fishing, stand up paddleboarding, canoeing, and kayaking.  This year we took our kayaks to the beach to kayak in Lake Huron. The beaches are ... One of the best provinciale park, large campground with long Beach area. I can't say enough good things about this provincial park. They have so many great trails to hike, the beach is beautiful, the campsites are plentiful and if you choose the right areas you aren't in your neighbors personal space. Great camping. Well cared for and lots of amenities. Beautiful beaches. Great park camp here yearly. I'd recommend renting a canoe or kayak for the afternoon as well. Perfect place to bring your pups to the beach.  Well-managed park with options to camp, canoe, cycle or simply relax. Always a great place for a day visit or a car camping trip. Some of the best sunsets in Southwestern Ontario. One of Ontario's most beautiful gems. Great spot for epic sunsets on the beach and nestled between forrest and sand dunes. 10 minute drive to Grand Bend and about a 35 minute drive from London. Be sure to book your spot early, this park fills up fast. For good reason! This has been our favourite park for more than ten years . Great very beautiful park with an excellent beach and great camping areas. Bathrooms are outstanding for a camping area and kept very clean. Bring bugspray as there are a lot of ticks in this area. My favorite Beach. I have to go here at least once a year. Gorgeous beach! Campsites could use some work so that it's easier to maneuver into them with Rigs. We had a very peaceful and invigorating stroll out to the Lake Huron shoreline on the Cedar Trail. You can't beat Pinery for well groomed trails, scenic vistas, and communing with nature. The oak savannah ecosystem and dunes are must sees. The camping is great too. Big and clean nature provincial park. We love this place. Love love love it ❤️it’s beautiful clean and safe ! 
What more could you want. 
Can’t wait to go back.... Pinery Provincial Park effectively acts as a small haven for those looking to get away from the day to day hustle and bustle of life.  Once inside, I quickly realized that the Park is much larger than it appears to be.  Among it's ... Always great! Take our dogs there every summer a few times! So worth the drive and the money!!!

I will always enjoy myself here Camped at The Pinery for 13 years straight and was never disappointed. Clean facilities, helpful and knowledgeable Naturalists/ park staff. Interpretive center and programs are always enjoyable and educational. Love this park ⛲🌳🎡 If I could, Pinery would get a MILLION stars. From when you arrive, you are greeted by warm, welcoming and helpful staff who will set you up with everything you need. They will clearly show your way to the campsite, and answer and ... Really nice water, clean and decent beach. Reason for 3star because the distance from where you park and the water is about 10 minutes of walk which can be very exhausting especially on the hot day that you want to go to the beach. Best park ever!  I used to backcountry camp when I was younger and so I was quite snobbish about the whole camping experience.  Now that I'm older and have a teenaged son and a travel trailer, the Pinery is like the Bahamas in Ontario to ... Most beautiful beach in Ontario. Don't tell anyone! Our family has gone to pinery every year since we first found it 6 years ago.  They offer programs for young children to learn about nature and the area.  Guided hikes at different times and great beaches.  You will need to walk or drive a bit as the camp is huge.  It's also one of the cleanest camps I've ever stayed. It was beautiful. Went during Easter weekend and felt like perfect sweater weather. Recommend using their new yurts. Love it.no bears😉🙄 but I go only in June before it is full.. peaceful then.lots of nature wandering around to see..wild turkeys and the little turketts Great park for camping or day use Park is great, beach, hike,bike...all outside is amazing...
When for a day and planning camping. Nice campground but beach is all stones and drift wood. Great park, and facilities but they need to fix the roads! Beautiful park but most of the sites are not very private. Winter yurt CAMPING..  very pretty . Went there with my family and my brothers family we has a good time Great park.  Very beautiful and also very clean. The best place to be in touch with nature and wildness. Very fun and awesome Most of the time restrooms were clean way to much poison ivy everywhere.  Not a bad experience Too many campsites which are very close to each other. Even the private campsites are not very private.  Facilities are not enough for the number of visitors. The beaches are narrow and rocky. Nice place for camping. Close to lake Grew up camping at Pinery, and now camping there with my own kids! Beautiful place. You definitely need bug sprays even on the beach. I love this place. Take me back. Kind of pricey but some nice trails. The dog beach is great Nice park ......but infested with poison ivy ....and dead trees and branches everywhere ...... ridiculous!!!  Place needs a good clean up !!! My second time camping, it was only for 1 day but had a great time, staying longer next time 😊 It is my favourite provincial park in Ontario. You will have an amazing time with your family and friends. It has many great activities within the park, the beach is very nice, clear and clean water. The picnic areas are wonderful even for a day's visit. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Went in winter. The XC skiing was excellent. Great place to learn, the trails run from pan flat to fairly flat. The yurt was nice, warm, bright, but they are not all the same. Warm showers and washrooms. Love the Pinery! They have the nicest beach around! Beautifull beaches. Don't get lost on you way out. Hahaha Easy hiking trails. A great place for family camping and day visits. Nice park. Always a good time. awesome park and beautiful view for sunset near the beach. Love it and will come again A great family weekend destination. Dog friendly. Magic moments with my family The Pinery is a great provincial park. Unfortunately,  the lake water level has risen so much that their beach is now mostly under water. If you like camping, if you like beaches, lake,  hiking, nature,

I Called finery Ontario  Provincial park..be careful because people getting fined left and right ,a lot of nonsence rules and regulations ..I got fined for $95 for being overcrowded despite of paying $45  that one of our visitor paid for ... Very very beautiful place and perfect for a short to long bike ride or walk depending on what you like. I love this park close to where i live ,fantastic accessible sites,  lots of walking trails & canoes,kayak rentals the channel is a peaceful trip , great swimming areas , The staff & conservation police are very nice . Just dont park where you shouldnt , you will get a ticket lolTHE SUNSETS ARE LEGENDARY. Nice in the off season but way to much 💰 and busy in the summer. Very nice camp but some sites are too far from the beach. Need to put more signs with directions on the roads, got lost while was looking for a registration point. This place is amazing! Most campsites are spacious being private to semi-private. The park offers a wide variety of water activities, such as canoeing, paddle-boarding, and a few other water crafts. Unfortunately, in the recent years, ... Beautiful park, excellent amenities, beautiful stoney beach. Removed a star for wood roaches. Pinery is the place to go for a summer weekend. I've never camped in that park, only went there as a day visitor, but many times. Of all the Great Lakes places for swimming and getting some sun on a sandy beach (in a reasonable ... it's quiet it's relaxing lots of canoeing lots of biking lots of hiking Racine water snakes sand cranes swans geese stuck fish Turtles awesome place to camp and relax Huge park with lots to see and do! 

There's a trail that goes around the entire park which you can drive through and have a nice slow scenic drive. 

There's also various beach access points, day picnic areas, and its only about a 10 ... One of our favourite annual camping spots! Nice place but disappointed in lack of dog beach access. If going there with dog ask first about dog beaches. Fun experience!  Definitely check the weather before going. Super cold and windy the day I went, but still gorgeous.  Deer just walked by us while we were on certain trails. Definitely going to try cross country skiing! Really nice provincial park.  There are so many trails to hike and things to do.  Our stay was very quiet. The beach is fairly rocky and my kids liked to go look for stones and fossils. The dunes are quite neat and different than most other parks I have been to. Planning to stay again longer next year. The best even in a thunderstorm..maybe even better... Super pretty place always been a huge fan of the pinery it’s absolutely beautiful I love staying here because I love fishing! Love it. Beautiful place Rocky beach but kids had fun, so that's what matters. We stayed at station 2, which is dog friendly (so do expect dog poops). Great quite place! We only stayed half a day and didn't have the chance to check on the trails and the sand ... Camped in a group campsite for the 2nd time
Everyone had a great time, no negatives
Lots of trails, helpful staff, lots of things to do Just went the other day for the first time. It was very nice. Trails to walk and bike. We were at site 9 at the beach. Picnic tables available and the beach was nice and enjoyable for the little ones. Also the water is shallow which is great if you have toddlers Great park, with great camping but it's super busy and it would be nice if staff would clean up the trails. It's the best getaway to nature in the area but not worth traveling to It is a nice park to enjoy during the summer One of the best summer destinations in SWO! We went camping here and they had incredible facilities. The dunes were great for the kids. Beautiful forest, great view of the lake. Good for bird watching Nice place not sure why some are crying about insect infestation you should go stay in  a Hampton hotel lmao anyways just beautiful no other words dont be discouraged because of some highty tighty comments :) Largest campground in Ontario. Huge! Bring a bike ( Do not plan to walk... too far). Nice beach and fairly close to grand bend. very busy during the summer if you can go shoulder season you will really enjoy. Great place to camp, good sites and beach Great place for camping, paddling, biking. Beach is very rocky. Very family friendly One of the best beach and water in my opinion Beach is nice. Lot of stones on the beach though. Our favourite spot to camp. Great spot for hiking, biking and kayaking. They rent bikes, kayaks, paddle boats, canoes for the people that don't have them. Beautiful sunsets. There is poison ivy and ticks you need to educate your kids not to go into the bushes I like to refer to The Pinery Provincial Park as the Outer Banks of the Great Lakes. We like camping there that much. There are dunes near shore. The beaches are rarely all that crowded. The water is beautiful. And, the people seem to be more civilized than many others who camp and RV. Great place to visit cant wait to go back Great dog beach, beautiful trails, amenities accessible throughout the park A great time. Nice large and private campsites. The Beach is awesome if you like waves! Bring water shoes for the band of pebble on tge beach though if you can. They will annihilate the soles of your feet, which is always good comedic value. Had a great time here. Easy to find, easy to reserve a spot online, and had no problems while camping.

Super impressed with how clean their washrooms and showers are. Yes, they have hot showers here, you just have to let them warm up ... Amazing. Please check out the beach at night when there is no moon, stellar views This is a nice family getaway. Has lots of activities for children including biking, hiking, kayaking/canoeing. It's also a great place for wildlife watching. We saw several different birds and a turtle basking on a log while on the ... Amazing place super friendly staff :) Bought a season pass and enjoy walking my dog there Amazing spot to camp with wonderful sunsets. Lovely day at Pinery provincial park. Ask the night before at your motel if they provide park passes for you to borrow. If not it's 17.00 per car which you can buy at the parks entrance. We visited day area 6 and 7. Walk through dunes ... Great place for families, beautiful wilderness. One of my favourite provincial parks.. A must visit if you visit grand bend beach 🌴. Usually less crowded than the beach and pretty long strech of sand. One of the best beaches in Ontario Great trails and beach Great park sites are large facilities are clean and well maintained.  Lots to do 10+ hike trails canoe and kayak rentals great to go biking.  One of the most popular parks so you need to book far in advance  Great park, over 1000 campsites. Make sure you book in advance as the campsite is always full.  
Park is about 10-15 minute drive to Grand Bend, (which also has a fantastic beach.)

Good campsites, clean washrooms and showers. 
Beautiful ... Great place!! Beautiful beaches Clean, large, campground.  The beach here is great.  Water shoes are recommended because there are lots of pebbles that can be a little rough on your feet. Great place to enjoy a bit of nature. There's a lot you can learn about this complex landscape and it's biodiversity at the Visitor's Center and topic nights at the amphitheater. Great spot for photographers and hobbyists of all sorts. ... Great place for family camping lots to do lots to see This is the best camping trip we've ever had, we can't wait to come back and spend a week!

Ice cream place was yummy too!  beautiful park. lots of good hiking trails. looking forward to seeing it in the summer. We stayed in the Dunes and it's was beautiful!

Clean showers Awesome beaches, well kept facilities, shaded campsites. Great weather.  Nice campsite in Dunes 1. Site 63. The beach had more stones than I remember and 2 sand bars. Quiet. Fairly private.  Love Sept  weekend. Picnic,Boating and canoe 🛶 all in one what else do you want more !! Awesome campgrounds. Very clean bathrooms. Fantastic beach, many Kilometres long, most of it empty if you are willing to walk about five minutes from the car park. Nice campgrounds, but book ahead because they are always full. Amazing oak savannah forest, like nothing else. The ... Very tranquil at this time of yes, a quiet walk you might be surprised what you see 😉 Not bad Always relaxing, close to home One word...""BEAUTIFUL"" worth the money. Great camp site with clean facilities So far my favourite provincial park. The beach is the best in Ontario in my opinion, and there are very few biting bugs (usually too breezy or sandy for mosquitos!!) Always a beautiful, well kept Park. Staff are helpful and always helpful, if needed. The Visitors centre has a Tax Free gift shop with various items at reasonable prices. Another fine memory made. Highly recommend family vacation! Had a great time kayaking and camping Just spent 4 great days at The Pinery Provincial Park with family and friends.  Safe Camp grounds and bathrooms are clean.  Love the beaches which are free of garbage.  So much to do hiking, canoing, biking and even Ice cream. We love ... Stayed in a park in mid of July and i had great time. All public amenities were clean and accessible. The big drawback was a rocky beach and flies. I couldn't just sit on a beach as flies were eating me alive and it was unbearable. Otherwise I highly recommend this place.  Beautiful park. Loved it Love it, come every year for a week.. Great family getaways at the Pinery Beautiful spot, had a few bad staffers but most were really great.  I won't let two bad eggs spoil the rating.

Had breakfast at the restaurant every morning, it was amazing!  Never have I done that while camping, but it was nice.

The water here is unbelievable, it's worth the visit. This campground is fantastic. Everything you need is available. Hiking. Canoe or kayaking. Right on Lake Huron, which to me, has magical properties in it. It makes you young again. Once you step in, you feel like a kid.  Awesome park!! Good stay so far Small sites and tons of poison ivy Great spot. Nice for BBQ or picnic right by the water since there are tables right by the water. I came for a day trip so I dunno about the camping area. Loved it. Highly recommanded when you wanna have a quit day on the beach. Sites are big and clean Best beach in Ontario!  Camping in the Dunes is primo location for tenting. Choose a site close to beach access. Miles of beach to stroll along. Bring your bike or hiking shoes to enjoy excellent trail system. Winter Camping in the yurts... so much fun!
Clean washrooms and yurts.
Lovely park. Very well kept facilities and a nice place to camp. Beware! Cockroaches and Ticks! I got bit by a dog tick first day I was there. Must've been when I was setting up the tent. So far no symptoms but I will see a doctor.  Didn't set the mood for sure. Next I noticed cockroaches crawling ... Wow! Great scenery and vistas of Lake Huron. You could see the glow of Cadet Bone Spur's hairpiece. Expensive day pass, but very nice park. Camp sites are large and they are not right next to other camp sites. Favourite place to go camping around Ontario. Clean campsite, clean washrooms and the beach was beautiful. Go to the park and camp. Take your kids with you and let them be closer to nature. Do the trails on foot or bike. Kayaking is also must. Don't forget family fishing. A week camping at the Pinery is barely enough to try a bit of everything the park has to offer. Well maintained campgrounds and camp-sites. Excellent services, friendly, helpful staff. Their facilities, location, bike trails, clean beaches, sandy beaches, proximity to Grand Bend, their icecream. Well maintained, family place, close to beach Lovely beaches and scenic drive for the day and great camping options too. Camp sites are shady, private and many are grassy and offer a good base for sleeping. Bring a pair of hard soled shoes for the beach (it's a bit rocky near/in the water). Very big site in Burley. Clean bathrooms Beautiful waters of Huron. Never had a mosquito bite me here. Great park. Very peaceful and well maintained park, with a beach and a lot of natural space. Did I mention the sunsets?

No place better in Ontario.  Some great campsite staff very helpful beware of wolves. Don't tape bacon to your pants Ok but too pricy for beach Love this park. Huge area, lots of hiking trails and wildlife and has 9 public beaches 2 which are dog friendly. Always busy with great camp store, nature centre and water for canoeing and paddle boats. Many kms of biking roads and trails. Wonderful place for families. If you want to vacation to a great beach with water at whatever depth you feel comfortable for kids and adults, then look no further. If i spend a couple days here its my quick cure for a Caribbean vacation Reasonable prices for kayaking. Needs to be more taken care off. The beach now sucks full of stones and not as nice water as before I have been camping at this park for over a decade with my family. It's our favorite park to camp at when we can actually get a site. Some sites have pretty decent privacy but many are very open with no privacy at all. Any on the nicer ... Beautiful place and great camping Best provincial park I've been going to the Pinery nearly every year since I was 6 and still get just as excited everything I go. Every time there is something new, wether it be spotting a bowfin slowly cruising beside your canoe or a scarlet tananger ... I trust our Government will take a firm hand to keep this park open to the general public and not let a few blackmail them into giving it up.  This seems to be a slippery slope where expectations continually increase as our government just throws dollars at the situation.  Case in point Caledonia. Got poison ivy... still had fun This place was chosen as my 2017 girl camping trip and we were all so happy that it was. This campground is very big, with 1000 spots yet it didn't feel claustrophobic. They kept the washrooms very very clean, with scheduled cleaning. The beach was spectacular, and the sunset is not to be missed!! Good beach times and great hike! Camped for a week with my ten year old.  There was something different to do every day.  We took advantage of most of the programs and really enjoyed them.  The nature centre was great to hang out at when it rained.  This park is good ... Amazing place with small but gorgeous private beaches,  much more family friendly than main beach in Grand Bend (although also great). 
Clean bathrooms and welcoming, renewed facilities. Very friendly staff and welcoming park. Love this park and it’s beaches Great camping Way too much poison Ivey Great place for camping and outdoor activities! Come here year after year solid place It is a great provincial park. Has amazing trails and it's one of the few open year-round for camping. Beautiful spot with plenty of space to explore! Clean bathrooms and camp sites. Best to bring water shoes as the shore is quite rocky. A great place to go for family camping. Staff keep the bathrooms in great shape. 

I recommend the alcohol-free weekends for a little more peacefulness. 

Poison Ivy is the only thing you have to watch out for here.  Really nice campground with great facilities Poison ivy is everywhere. The bane of campers!! A fun time at a great place. From the water it was awsome It's my first time visiting this park, i really loving it. Ticks Poison Ivy And cockroaches right at the camp site. Two weeks of recovery after petting the dog. Never again. What I learned... Read the reviews. Read the reviews! Always read the reviews, before taking any trip.  Nice park, great for camping or just day use of the beach area. Facilities are well maintained and the beach is clean, with waves. The fire pits are ideal for BBQ and campsites vary in size. A great provincial park by Lake Huron, and not a far drive from Grand Bend, ON. I camped here for 5 days and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Nice trails, amazing beach, lots of varied nature, didn't have a lot of bugs or animals really (which surprised me). A lovely campground, Best place for canoe... One of my favourite camping spots. I've been coming here for over 20 years now. The beaches are fantastic, the camp staff are amazing, kayaking the canal is always an adventure and the campsites are fairly well maintained.

The whole section is pretty good and it's off the main road, relatively far but close enough to the water and washrooms.  The whole section was pretty good even ... great cycling park. The staff were very professional and approachable. The washroom and bath facilities were always clean. There is a store within the park if you needed food at reasonable price.  I would stay all summer. Always lots to do. Park staff always friendly and helpful. Great camping spot! Must check it out. Good place for camping, but if you are not good at canoe, don't try it because they don't have any responsibility of your safety. My family was almost drowning the day before yesterday, but they were just watching us. They don't try to ... The kids had a lot of fun Clean park clean showers. Difficult to maneuver our 16ft trailer roads were narrow.  The sites were clean though. Would return. Was an absolute blast. And very beautiful trails. With great kayak, canoe, paddle boat and aqua bike rentals. Great place to camp A very beautiful provincial park with tons of trails to hike.  I just loved this place.

Good beach. Great camping,canoeing, birdwatching, trails,visitor center, restaurant, and pebble beach. If you would like to learn how to kayaking/canoeing, then you should come to Pinery. There is wide channel, steady water and plenty of wild life. Btw, they have nice sandy beaches as well. Pinery park is a beautiful place to spend some time.  The staff this season although good didn't seem to be as personable as past years.  The value is great, however rule and regulation enforcement often ruins family vacations.  Noise, ... With spacious campsites, well-maintained hiking + biking trails, and granular beaches, this provincial park is a prime nature enabler. 10/10 would recommend Amaizing place to be.

Much quieter than pinery... SHHHHH don't tell anyone. This park has a great beach with picnic tables and volleyball nets set up for everyone to use and clear water great for snorkeling. There are also some nice hiking trails and plenty of cool fossils to be found on the southern portion of the beach!   Clean and family friendly! Met so many kind people Bathrooms and showers kept clean good hot showers. They need to start the kids crafts, barn dances, sandcastle contest, group camp fire, etc again. When they condemned the barn they stoped all activities and even though I'm 19 now, it still disappoints me when I go back every year.  Very nice place! Great views, nice trails, decent privacy, clean facilities. 100% recommended. Nice park Really good location with public toilets Great place to go camping with the family.  Very nice, enjoyed our stay, we'll be back Our camp area was right near the water so that was an advantage, the staff was exceptionally nice, and were willing to help out with our problems.  The beach was cool but due to a bacterial infection in the water people were scared to go ... Great site with excellent shade, facilities were very good. A bit noisy but very worth it. Can't wait to come back but will avoid the weekend. Hydro, no water hookup, dog park. we enjoyed the stay. Family friendly, nice beach and trails.

Beach is all sand, and you can walk out forever with amazing natural sandbanks here and there. There's also a dog beach with tons of space for ... Love camping here. Lots of activities for the kids and the playground is great too. Clean washrooms/showers.

My only complaint is the beach is a little hike from the parking lot and the boardwalk seems short. But I understand that they don't want to ruin the natural areas. Great park.
Spacious sites.
Lots of vegetation between sites for excellent privacy.
Large, well groomed beach.
Water is only a few feet deep for about a kilometer out from shore. 
Great for young kids.
Book early in season since sites go quickly. I love this park! The beach is great. We were there on a long weekend and still had lots of space for beach volleyball and kite flying. The campsites are big and private. The washrooms/showers are new and clean. 
The town is a sleepy ... So beautiful here.  We stayed 1 week on a ravine site. One of the unreservable sites. We were lucky to get it on the last week before school. Truly the nicest sites there. Washrooms facilities were exceptionally clean and lots of showers ... Good sandy beach. Waves in the water which makes it fun. Dog friendly with a dedicated dog off leash area. 
Less crowded than some of the other beaches I have been to.
One downside is that the walk from parking lot to beach is a little longer than some other places. Great spot for camping or a beach trip. Well maintained. Close enough to local amenities should you need something. Rates seem a bit high, but considering the maintenance and service provided the price is justified. Great sites. Nice walks. Good bathroom shower and laundry facilities. You need very long hydro cables to connect to power source. Beach awesome but either a long walk or a short car ride. I thought it was a great public  nude beach.   $15 for entry clothing was in use on beach markers 1-5 but park in lot 5 and walk apx 500 yards past lot 6 and there is the nude beach.   Every type no need to be embarrassed because nobody ... Sites are beautiful, though staff is very strict and mostly teenagers on power trips or have no authority at all.  Use the eastern public beach as it is groomed, free and there's a French fry shack.  Also bring cash as the ice cream shop at the top of the hill doesn't take credit card.  Otherwise great fun. Large beach, rather clean, separate area for dogs, spacious parking. Washrooms leave to wish better. Great spot, our first time visiting.  Nice mix of site types, and lots of space to explore.  Plenty of bathrooms, a very nice park for the kids and a huge field with badminton (and volleyball?) nets as well.

You are immediately greeted ... We had a great time catching into the big wave. The beach is shadow and is for the kids.  The only disappointment was the colour of the sand beneath the water.  It is black and brown and stained our swimming wear. Awesome place to relax in a small town. Been here a few times and its surprisingly a pleasant enviroment to be in. We came to stay for 1 night and ended up spending a whole week. A beautiful campground the sites have plenty of shade and are big. They have enough trees that you are fairly secluded from your neighbour which gives plenty of privacy. We ... Great dog beach. Sandy and shallow. Warm water, I highly recommend going. First time there, but will definitely be back This is a great place with very good public and provincial park beaches.  There are short but nice hiking trails, a good playground for kids and good facilities.  The nearby town of Port Burwell is small but very nice too and boasts a retired military submarine on display and open for tours. Usually love this beach! Been here countless Times! Went today and had to pay by putting $ in a dropbox as it is late in the season. After depositing our $14.50 we found as we entered the beach area it was unbearable! We were swarmed by ... Well maintained & clean.generous sites in iroquois campground. Lovely walking trail. Spectacular beach. Sadly, swimming was not recommended when we were here. Helpful staff. As a first time camper I must say this park is very clean, we'll laid out with sites that include electrical hook ups, and privacy.  My family really enjoyed our stay and recommend it. Well maintained, in a lovely small-town area on Lake Erie, large dog beach. Not over crowded even on busy weekends Lovely colours in the fall. Walk at own risk but lovely to have the park to yourself Great beach area with nice sand and plenty of parking.  Much less busy than the free beach just next door in town. Trails to the beach from the camping areas exist, but you have to look carefully to see the signs for them. We weren't exactly at the park but we did enjoy the beach just a few minutes down the road. P1 is the dog beach and I believe 2-5 is the other areas you may enjoy (just not with dogs). Very clean and lots of sticks to throw if you decide ... Large sites,   sandy beach, clean washrooms and great cycling through some of the best farm land in Ontario. This park has lots to offer The provincial park beach is amazing.
If you go to the last parking lot it is less busy and is away from the dog beach.
The beach is monitored by park rangers so it is a family friendly safe environment Great place for us big women ...u can feel good in your skin....no fee parking ..family oriented.  2volley ball courts..  Chip stand ...washroom outside ...inside @ outside shower.    ..no life guards..u r the life guards...watch for undercurrents..if wave r choppy Not much of a camper, but I know enough to recommend this park. Very pretty, good proximity to the pier, and nice showers! Very well maintained campsites and facilities.  Friendly staff. Great kids playground and field. Beautiful park but somewhat long walk to the beach. Go early or late as the midday sun is too hot for dogs paws to access the beach. Ice cream shop at dog beach Great provincial park.  Each site seemed to be secluded and easy to make private.   Beech was awesome and good sand bars for my young kids. When you charge 14.50 for a one day pass. I can see why everyone wants to go to the free beach. This place has no picnic tables on the beach.the main public beach has lots. Bathrooms are limited and a long walk from the beach. No i would not return. strongly recommend large buffer zones between most sites for more private experience. bathrooms are newer and adequately attentend to Stayed in Leander section on the Civic holiday long weekend. Most sites were occupied by families with many children running around. But they were all well-behaved and there was no public drunkenness on the part of the adults. All this ... Extremely disappointing.  In a sentence, if you are looking for an outdoor actual camping experience, don't stay here.  Its right beside the town and you can see houses/cottages from the sites, we heard sirens and fire trucks several ... It’s great if you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of bigger beaches in the area like Grand Bend, but it comes at a cost. It’s isolated so good options are limited. There are no food choices in the immediate area other ... Campsites are always spacious, nice and well groomed. Bathrooms are kept spotless, and the staff is always helpful. Beach is great, even though the walk is long. The beach used to be a lot better when it was maintained.  It has now become overgrown in many areas in what is called ""returning to a natural state."" This park is crazy. I've never seen more private sites in a Provincial Park.  There's a mix of relatively open sites, but there are just so, so many absolutely private spots.  The foliage is so dense!

The beach is perfectly maintained ... Amazing spot with fantastic dog beach.  Can be busy in high season but worth exploring. The site was lovely except for the picnic table which was long past its due date...I know it's not full season yet....but the spped limit around the park is not enforced enough..
We've stayed there for a few years now and can highly recommend it.... Quiet beach, amazing water .... I like the fact it gets deep so you can actually swim. Nice, quite, isolated place. Good for family RV trips Loved it there very clean ad u can bring your dog you can have them leash or Unleashed it's up to you perfect place to bring your dog Large campsites but be prepared if your site is shadey. For any folks afraid if spiders there is an excessive amount of daddy long legs.  I would have preferred mosquitos since you just need off for them.   

Washrooms are maintained ... Other then the long walk from parking to the Optional Beach..Its Awesome !!  Clean beach & a good time 😎 Provincial Park beach is a beautiful long sandy beach with long shallow section before water gets deep.   Water was beautiful temperature.  Like being in the Caribbean. A nice white sandy beach and blue water..reminds us of a few vacation spots overseas ,when you see this from the long boardwalk at the lighthouse you stand to wonder of all the nice areas in our own backyard. Had a great time. Planning my trip back. Need to stay longer to make the most of it . Great sites, amazing beach. One of the best provincial parks in SW Ontario. Wonderful park
Keep it clean please. Awful service and pricing. Another case of Ontario gouging the public. Their website is always wrong and very misleading. Will think twice about going to any Ontario provincial park again. Brutal!!!! The only positive for this park is the off leash area of the beach Only one car per campsite. This sucks especially if you have a large family or are a part of bigger groups. Beautiful place to go for weekend camping or day visit Very small campground su it  is quite. Only issue is that the beach is in a different area. You have to drive out of the campground and down the road to get to the beach. Good camping area with decent shaded camp sites. Came into a camp site with no grass and surŕounded by trees which blocked out the sun and the site was very dirty bc of fallen debrief from the trees.  it had rained b4 we arrived and was very muddy for entirely time were this site.  The ... It is very nice place to be.  The beaches very nice and clean and even the water was very clear. Been going down for 28 years best memories as a kid. Miss the old sandy beach what it use to be. Such a great campground. Has great playground area with lots of greenspace Great park, private sites, great dog beach there every day just be forewarned there's always one bad dog owner in every crowd. Two boxers this past weekend one who was attacking biting others dogs at least six that I saw, owner would call dog back and give it a treat. Has a great dog beach with an off leash area. Definitely coming back. We went with our children and had an extraordinary experience in this park. I totally recommend Port Burwell Park for camping!!! I would like to see the wood path go all the way to the beach. Absolutely one of the best world class beaches, and it has a dog friendly section that today was full of friendly playful dogs Nice park great staff. Park needs to be updated. The manager there is is horrible not customer friendly there was no one at the gate to take money . I was  .25 cents short of the $ 14.50 and she wanted me to drive into town to pay  the quarter  I mean really.  I paid$15.00 I  hop she saves it and uses it for the next person short Great beach but the washrooms needs .ore maintenance. Great beach the waves were amazing today! Always a good visit to he park. Loved it as a child and love it still. Beautiful park. Great beach! Shallow water and clean. We had a great experience..love the Beach Not much to see.... Pt Burwell seems to be a town without much going for it. Lots of closed shops in the downtown. The beach is a 'Blue Flag' beach, so at least they take their beach appearance seriously. It's a great place to go there's a lot of fun stuff to see and do. The sites seemed to have good privacy and were a good size, and the washroom facilities seemed taken care of and clean. Would book here again :) If you’re going, don’t miss the west beach (west of the Big Otter River). Simply exotic! Watch out for Poison Ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) and biting insects! Great camping big site's Good place for kids to have fun and enjoy the beach. Great park and the leash free dog beach  make it the best Nice provincial park. Not much for privacy between sites near the front, probly due to ash tree die off. Good trails beachs and facilities. Becuase it says ""dog beach"" you basicly have the beach to your self What a great place to visit. The beach area is wonderful...water is clean Great beach, and very clean. Friendly people and dogs. Pretty place. Liked the drive there Best dog breach, off leash too Visited the nude beach, nice place I liked my first visit to the nudist beach but the mosquitoes were terrible. The beach needs a good clean-up. Way too many much branches and old driftwood could cut your feet. People were friendly the staff was too! Best park that I have been. Very big sites. Awesome staff! Bathroom is clean all the time. Beach is great but windy. It would be great to have direct access to the  beach from the camping.   Quiet peaceful large Beach that one could get lost on if they wished beautiful sunsets clean water We've been to this park a number of times on a day pass.

Fishing is decent ... nice park - nothing else in the area Beautiful amazing place to relax Love the beach at this provincial park. Great lake nice park. One of my favourite beaches. Very sandy, although pockets of crushed shells can get tough on the feet in places. Very long and easy to find a nice quiet spot to spend the day. Only down side is paying for a day pass Fun for the whole family or just friends Some electrical posts are on the wrong side for trailers, but otherwise a very nice place and would come again 🙂 The provincial park is one of the best kept parks I have been to. The dog beach is a big draw as it is the only one in Port Burwell. the facilities are well kept and the trails are excellent for walking, jogging, or bike rides. The sites varied regarding privacy, shade, and size but overall were fine. The beach for the park is so overgrown with tons of branches in the sand. I believe this is due to a new motion to let the beaches go naturally. As an alternative, there is a city beach not far from the park which is clean/cleared. Very well run campsite. Modern amenities such as shower and bathroom were much more than adequate and within walking distance of our campsite. The site itself was a good size. Not a lot of forest though. Big private sites 😆 Beach is not what it used to be. And that's too bad. Nice little park. Beautiful park quiet during the week Nice park, but busy ... Nice park. Large sites.

Great people and great sense of humour too I might add Clean and very relaxing! Gorgeous beaches, beautiful large, private campsites,  super friendly park staff. A great week!  Great beach, a bit natural and ungroomed. Beach area and camping are separate. The far west end of the beach is on private property and is nudest beach, very friendly. Great dog park Great dog park We went to section 5 parking lot and when we pulled in there was a young woman naked prancing around.  We proceeded up to the beach and headed right.

The beach is beautiful and there's a huge sandbar so dogs can walk out quite a distance in the water. Super disappointed with this provincial park. The parking area was full of holes and most were blocked off by huge piles of dirt or construction tape. Getting to the beach from parking area 2 is impossible, the wooden walkway is ... One of my favourites beaches to go every summer.  Warmer waters and not as deep. Always use caution with children and be safe. Love camping here and the beach is great.

Have hosted several family BBQ's...is a favorite for us. Nice walk on the beach. . Love the leash free doggy beach. Just wish they had a boardwalk to it Great park. The dog beach is an added bonus. Campsites were nice, but not as private as the website made it seem. Had a great start to the camping season at this gem of the Ontario Parks system. 4/5 only because the water in the showers was ice cold (start-of-season glitch?). Great sites and short ride (on bicycles) or drive to the expansive beach. Some awesome dinning to be had in town as well.  Good place for camping, close to town, easy to get supplies 👍 This place is great.  Nice sites and the kids loved it. Beautiful. Book far in advance. This is a hidden gem of a park. The sites are spacious and private and the park is beautiful. It has by far the best off leash dog beach that I have ever been to.  Dog beach is good. Loved using the dog beach.

Shame you can't unleash the dogs, but it is completely open to the regular beach. a nice mix of very private and open campsites, quiet at night and lots of stuff for the kids. A hidden gem ... particularly about a 20 minute walk down the beach just beyond the the park boundaries where clothing is optional and the seclusion is divine Great camping, good trails and lots of beach access Decent park, family firefly and very nice well kept and combed beaches.

Well maintained. Enjoyed our time there. Great beach Great family campground. We have been camping here for years. The East Beach was great.

Superbe plage belle endroit","The 2.5 km sandy beach is one of most beautiful on the northern shore of Lake Erie.
An exceptional family friendly campground with large, well-treed, level sites as well as an outstanding play area for kids.
Family-friendly Discovery Drop-ins from July 1st to Labour Day.
Enjoy an amazing dog beach and pet exercise area with your four-legged friend.
The group camping area can accommodate big groups on sprawling, private sites.
An undiscovered birder’s paradise, experience the marvels of migration during the fall.Absolutely my favorite place to go for either a day trip to the beach, or camping at the park. Beach is all sand, and you can walk out forever with amazing natural sandbanks here and there. There's also a dog beach with tons of space for ... Love camping here. Lots of activities for the kids and the playground is great too. Clean washrooms/showers.

My only complaint is the beach is a little hike from the parking lot and the boardwalk seems short. But I understand that they don't want to ruin the natural areas. Great park.
Spacious sites.
Lots of vegetation between sites for excellent privacy.
Large, well groomed beach.
Water is only a few feet deep for about a kilometer out from shore. 
Great for young kids.
Book early in season since sites go quickly. I love this park! The beach is great. We were there on a long weekend and still had lots of space for beach volleyball and kite flying. The campsites are big and private. The washrooms/showers are new and clean. 
The town is a sleepy ... So beautiful here.  We stayed 1 week on a ravine site. One of the unreservable sites. We were lucky to get it on the last week before school. Truly the nicest sites there. Washrooms facilities were exceptionally clean and lots of showers ... Good sandy beach. Waves in the water which makes it fun. Dog friendly with a dedicated dog off leash area. 
Less crowded than some of the other beaches I have been to.
One downside is that the walk from parking lot to beach is a little longer than some other places. Great spot for camping or a beach trip. Well maintained. Close enough to local amenities should you need something. Rates seem a bit high, but considering the maintenance and service provided the price is justified. Great sites. Nice walks. Good bathroom shower and laundry facilities. You need very long hydro cables to connect to power source. Beach awesome but either a long walk or a short car ride. I thought it was a great public  nude beach.   $15 for entry clothing was in use on beach markers 1-5 but park in lot 5 and walk apx 500 yards past lot 6 and there is the nude beach.   Every type no need to be embarrassed because nobody ... Sites are beautiful, though staff is very strict and mostly teenagers on power trips or have no authority at all.  Use the eastern public beach as it is groomed, free and there's a French fry shack.  Also bring cash as the ice cream shop at the top of the hill doesn't take credit card.  Otherwise great fun. Large beach, rather clean, separate area for dogs, spacious parking. Washrooms leave to wish better. Great spot, our first time visiting.  Nice mix of site types, and lots of space to explore.  Plenty of bathrooms, a very nice park for the kids and a huge field with badminton (and volleyball?) nets as well.

You are immediately greeted ... We had a great time catching into the big wave. The beach is shadow and is for the kids.  The only disappointment was the colour of the sand beneath the water.  It is black and brown and stained our swimming wear. Awesome place to relax in a small town. Been here a few times and its surprisingly a pleasant enviroment to be in. We came to stay for 1 night and ended up spending a whole week. A beautiful campground the sites have plenty of shade and are big. They have enough trees that you are fairly secluded from your neighbour which gives plenty of privacy. We ... Great dog beach. Sandy and shallow. Warm water, I highly recommend going. First time there, but will definitely be back This is a great place with very good public and provincial park beaches.  There are short but nice hiking trails, a good playground for kids and good facilities.  The nearby town of Port Burwell is small but very nice too and boasts a retired military submarine on display and open for tours. Usually love this beach! Been here countless Times! Went today and had to pay by putting $ in a dropbox as it is late in the season. After depositing our $14.50 we found as we entered the beach area it was unbearable! We were swarmed by ... Well maintained & clean.generous sites in iroquois campground. Lovely walking trail. Spectacular beach. Sadly, swimming was not recommended when we were here. Helpful staff.

Well maintained, in a lovely small-town area on Lake Erie, large dog beach. Not over crowded even on busy weekends Lovely colours in the fall. Walk at own risk but lovely to have the park to yourself Great beach area with nice sand and plenty of parking.  Much less busy than the free beach just next door in town. Trails to the beach from the camping areas exist, but you have to look carefully to see the signs for them. We weren't exactly at the park but we did enjoy the beach just a few minutes down the road. P1 is the dog beach and I believe 2-5 is the other areas you may enjoy (just not with dogs). Very clean and lots of sticks to throw if you decide ... Large sites,   sandy beach, clean washrooms and great cycling through some of the best farm land in Ontario. This park has lots to offer The provincial park beach is amazing.
If you go to the last parking lot it is less busy and is away from the dog beach.
The beach is monitored by park rangers so it is a family friendly safe environment Great place for us big women ...u can feel good in your skin....no fee parking ..family oriented.  2volley ball courts..  Chip stand ...washroom outside ...inside @ outside shower.    ..no life guards..u r the life guards...watch for undercurrents..if wave r choppy Not much of a camper, but I know enough to recommend this park. Very pretty, good proximity to the pier, and nice showers! Very well maintained campsites and facilities.  Friendly staff. Great kids playground and field. Beautiful park but somewhat long walk to the beach. Go early or late as the midday sun is too hot for dogs paws to access the beach. Ice cream shop at dog beach Great provincial park.  Each site seemed to be secluded and easy to make private.   Beech was awesome and good sand bars for my young kids. When you charge 14.50 for a one day pass. I can see why everyone wants to go to the free beach. This place has no picnic tables on the beach.the main public beach has lots. Bathrooms are limited and a long walk from the beach. No i would not return. strongly recommend large buffer zones between most sites for more private experience. bathrooms are newer and adequately attentend to Stayed in Leander section on the Civic holiday long weekend. Most sites were occupied by families with many children running around. But they were all well-behaved and there was no public drunkenness on the part of the adults. All this ... Extremely disappointing.  In a sentence, if you are looking for an outdoor actual camping experience, don't stay here.  Its right beside the town and you can see houses/cottages from the sites, we heard sirens and fire trucks several ... It’s great if you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of bigger beaches in the area like Grand Bend, but it comes at a cost. It’s isolated so good options are limited. There are no food choices in the immediate area other ... Campsites are always spacious, nice and well groomed. Bathrooms are kept spotless, and the staff is always helpful. Beach is great, even though the walk is long. The beach used to be a lot better when it was maintained.  It has now become overgrown in many areas in what is called ""returning to a natural state."" This park is crazy. I've never seen more private sites in a Provincial Park.  There's a mix of relatively open sites, but there are just so, so many absolutely private spots.  The foliage is so dense!

The beach is perfectly maintained ... Amazing spot with fantastic dog beach.  Can be busy in high season but worth exploring. The site was lovely except for the picnic table which was long past its due date...I know it's not full season yet....but the spped limit around the park is not enforced enough..
We've stayed there for a few years now and can highly recommend it.... Quiet beach, amazing water .... I like the fact it gets deep so you can actually swim. Nice, quite, isolated place. Good for family RV trips Loved it there very clean ad u can bring your dog you can have them leash or Unleashed it's up to you perfect place to bring your dog Large campsites but be prepared if your site is shadey. For any folks afraid if spiders there is an excessive amount of daddy long legs.  I would have preferred mosquitos since you just need off for them.   

Washrooms are maintained ... Other then the long walk from parking to the Optional Beach..Its Awesome !!  Clean beach & a good time 😎 Provincial Park beach is a beautiful long sandy beach with long shallow section before water gets deep.   Water was beautiful temperature.  Like being in the Caribbean. A nice white sandy beach and blue water..reminds us of a few vacation spots overseas ,when you see this from the long boardwalk at the lighthouse you stand to wonder of all the nice areas in our own backyard. Had a great time. Planning my trip back. Need to stay longer to make the most of it . Great sites, amazing beach. One of the best provincial parks in SW Ontario. Wonderful park
Keep it clean please. Awful service and pricing. Another case of Ontario gouging the public. Their website is always wrong and very misleading. Will think twice about going to any Ontario provincial park again. Brutal!!!! The only positive for this park is the off leash area of the beach Only one car per campsite. This sucks especially if you have a large family or are a part of bigger groups. Beautiful place to go for weekend camping or day visit Very small campground su it  is quite. Only issue is that the beach is in a different area. You have to drive out of the campground and down the road to get to the beach. Good camping area with decent shaded camp sites. Came into a camp site with no grass and surŕounded by trees which blocked out the sun and the site was very dirty bc of fallen debrief from the trees.  it had rained b4 we arrived and was very muddy for entirely time were this site.

Definitely coming back. We went with our children and had an extraordinary experience in this park. I totally recommend Port Burwell Park for camping!!! I would like to see the wood path go all the way to the beach. Absolutely one of the best world class beaches, and it has a dog friendly section that today was full of friendly playful dogs Nice park great staff. Park needs to be updated. The manager there is is horrible not customer friendly there was no one at the gate to take money . I was  .25 cents short of the $ 14.50 and she wanted me to drive into town to pay  the quarter  I mean really.  I paid$15.00 I  hop she saves it and uses it for the next person short Great beach but the washrooms needs .ore maintenance. Great beach the waves were amazing today! Always a good visit to he park.

The kids were able to ride their bikes around the park.  Clean washrooms and showers.  Leash free dog beach. Quiet, relaxing, nice beaches. Great fun.

Great people and great sense of humour too I might add Clean and very relaxing! Gorgeous beaches, beautiful large, private campsites,  super friendly park staff. A great week!  Great beach, a bit natural and ungroomed. Beach area and camping are separate. The far west end of the beach is on private property and is nudest beach, very friendly. Great dog park Great dog park We went to section 5 parking lot and when we pulled in there was a young woman naked prancing around.  We proceeded up to the beach and headed right.  Only a short distance later 2 elderly people sitting naked.  When I found out there ... One of our favourite campgrounds and a must visit every year. Good sized sites with lots of privacy. And the park still has one of the best beaches in the province. Love coming here year after year with the family! Beautiful park.  Love this park and beach I went and checked out campsites for the future. I only purchased a day pass to enjoy the off-leash park with my dog but it was a really great experience. The beach is beautiful and there's a huge sandbar so dogs can walk out quite a distance in the water. Super disappointed with this provincial park. The parking area was full of holes and most were blocked off by huge piles of dirt or construction tape. Getting to the beach from parking area 2 is impossible, the wooden walkway is ... One of my favourites beaches to go every summer.  Warmer waters and not as deep. Always use caution with children and be safe. Love camping here and the beach is great. Highly recommend visiting here. Lots of fun!  Great activities everyday (in season) for kids.  Fun place to bring the family, lots of free beach and a larger (nicer) paid side. Have hosted several family BBQ's...is a favorite for us. Nice walk on the beach. . Love the leash free doggy beach. Just wish they had a boardwalk to it Great park. The dog beach is an added bonus. Campsites were nice, but not as private as the website made it seem. Had a great start to the camping season at this gem of the Ontario Parks system. 4/5 only because the water in the showers was ice cold (start-of-season glitch?). Great sites and short ride (on bicycles) or drive to the expansive beach. Some awesome dinning to be had in town as well.  Good place for camping, close to town, easy to get supplies 👍 This place is great.  Nice sites and the kids loved it. Beautiful. Book far in advance. This is a hidden gem of a park. The sites are spacious and private and the park is beautiful. It has by far the best off leash dog beach that I have ever been to.  Dog beach is good. Loved using the dog beach. Was fairly clean, and nice access to the water. Sandy beach and lots of sticks for the pup.
Shame you can't unleash the dogs, but it is completely open to the regular beach. a nice mix of very private and open campsites, quiet at night and lots of stuff for the kids. A hidden gem ... particularly about a 20 minute walk down the beach just beyond the the park boundaries where clothing is optional and the seclusion is divine Great camping, good trails and lots of beach access Decent park, family firefly and very nice well kept and combed beaches.  Great campsites and playground for kids. Need to drive to the beach, but very big and sandy. Clean bathrooms. Good, large campsites. Had a great time with the family. One of my favorite camping spots. Super friendly staff. And a very clean campsite! Couldn't agree more Mark, The private beach is A1, PLUS, at Port Burwell, since there aren't as many buildings around, there is less smog, thus you get a stronger sun. Love the off leash dog park here! Awsome  sand beaches not overcrowded  washroom  was clean. Lots of parking.  Great park Beautiful beach. But for that price they should have change rooms.  Well maintained. Enjoyed our time there. Great beach Great family campground. We have been camping here for years. The East Beach was great.  It had shallow water which the kids could walk out quite a ways into.  The sand was not rocky either. Clean but very busy..book early. Walk across dunes to the  beach! This is a great campground. I've been going here all my life. And my most recent experience was still great. They don't have as many activities as they used to, but our spot backed onto a ravine and it was really private. They have their ... Lots of fun camping and nice campsites. Could get lost in some campground sections. Perfect for a nice beach day and great for local travellers Quiet, close to town.

Really pleasant place to be. Very wild away from society Excellent place to take your whole family, including your dog. Althought it costs $15/day just to visit the beach for the day no matter how long you stay Great time.  Wish it was longer :-(

We took him to the doggy beach and I took him ... Amazing scenery Very nice private beach I grew up near here and always loved watching the fireworks. Love camping here.

Camp sites are relatively far from the beach. Best place to camp and beach Great dog beach area. Off-leash exercise is permitted a little further out. Beautiful Sandy Beach that is shallow with many sand dunes  Large mature Carolinian forest with spacious private sites cut into the forest. A large sandy beach a joins the park. Quiet, peaceful location.  Just did a day pass, dog beach is nice and big. The best off leash dog beach in Ontario  The park staff are very friendly.  The beach is not close to the camp sites. One of the best kept secret's on Lake Erie the beach is fantastic We have camped here a couple times, always a good time!  Awesome dog beach at beach number 1 Nice place for the summer.

The facilities were clean, the sites were quiet, and the park of course is gorgeous! 

Only downside was many ""too friendly"" raccoons (sitting on the picnic table with us too friendly! Even with all food in the closed car.) The camp sites are a bit close, but the beach was awesome.

It was a great time Fantastic board walks to have you be one with nature. Walk through the woods and listen to the many sounds.  Beautiful area. Christmas craft show was wonderful!!

Excellent park layout, nice beaches lots of camp sites and walking trails. Large Marsh area and boardwalk.  Great sandy beaches! Fantastic place. Beautiful beach and a lot of places to picnic Tried to go bird watching. Saw at least 3 seagulls. Couldn't be sure of the rest because I forgot my eyeglasses.

One of the best parks around Toronto. Always been a visitor to the beaches there . Day passes are available. We came to see the trees change colors in late September and it was beautiful! The Marsh Boardwalk Trail is simply stunning! We were lucky because the summer season was over and there weren't that many people. Beautiful park, great for looking for fossils! Both information centres are fun and interesting. Nice and well maintained park! A bit colder and windy compare to other park, because it's near the water! I love this park!   I'm having to rate it only a 3 star only because of the flooding problems which is out of everyone's control.  Walking paths along the shore are gone. Beaches are closed. Many of the campsites are so saturated that ... Quiet and clean. Great camping sites, amazing view of Lake Ontario, great walks and cool lighthouse. Great for collecting rocks Such a beautiful place to hang out with friends and family. The water sceneries  were amazing and the water itself was so clean and clear. Definetly would recommend this to everyone. Have always loved this beautiful and historic provincial park! There are so many areas one can explore or relax. History buffs will also love the interpretive buildings and Information plaques found throughout the park. Loved our time here, great proximity to Prince Edward county. Great nature programs for the kids! Scheduled activities and shows perfect for kids of all ages, adults learned alot too!  The mosquitoes are a bit crazy this year because of all the rain we've had so gear up! Beautiful scenery. Great for picnics or outdoor grilling. Be careful in the water! I was just cleaning a cottage for resident This park is located less than 2h from Toronto. There are 3 beaches and a really nice picnic area where you can spend a day on the lake. Quiet park, nice beaches. Beautiful place to ride a bike. Great park. Nice beaches. The boardwalk trail is definitely something to check out it you're interested in nature at all. There's a lot of history here.  Even if the beaches were closed because of the flood, the day use area is a wonderful place to spend some peaceful time. Although the beaches were flooded and bugs were out in droves, not to mention being moved sites to a very crowded area - overall was great relaxing experience.  =) Great park and beach Nature trails, beaches, and a lighthouse. Beautiful park that's reasonably close to Toronto.  Perfect for picnics and day trips.  The peninsula was much cooler than just 30 minutes north towards the 401 so it was great for the hot humid summer days.  Plenty of picnic tables ... Spent a marvelous day with our daughter and granddaughter great park all ways something to do there This park is a good location for Torontonians who want to experience nature, but don't want to drive too far out of the City.

The trails are all well maintained and the beaches are nice. A beautiful park, lots of different habitats. Beautiful trails. Great for a day trip or camping.

Super friendly staff despite coming in late at night. Wish we had more time to explore the park's offerings. Two stars. My group and I were sitting around the campfire minding our own business with a guitar, and a ranger came and threatened to fine us if we didn't stop right away. We stopped, however the rangers came to our campsite about every ... Wonderful experience! Love this park. Great trails and campsites and the beach is great. Very shallow sandy bottom. Great for young kids. Have camped here in the fall a couple years and found it a pleasant experience. Right at the lake makes for a beautiful backdrop. It's been a tradition to watch the sunsets here. Biking around, exploring the boardwalk, visiting the Light House are all must-do-activities. Love this park
Three beach
Lots of trails 
Nice sites Very nice park. Great campsites Great place to bike or walk. There is a lot of traffic and a very diverse Canadian location.  Nice park Great beach, camping, and fishing.  Perfect spot for summer family fun! Amazing beaches  great camp sites    washroom facilities inserios need of upgrade  Clean air, tranquillity, natural beauty Beautiful and quiet park.

Close to stores in Brighton for supplies,  and only 20 minutes to Trenton for a wider store selection.  Nice Beach Great Camping Experience Early in the Season

The end of April is a hard time to find a campground in Canada and Presqu'ile Provincial Park opened early in the season giving us an opportunity to enjoy a few days hiking and birdwatching in a peaceful environment. Arrived the day after Labour Day and the Park Store, Nature Center and 2/3 of the beach access points were closed for the season.  Staff were only there from 8AM-4PM through the week.  We arrived at 4:30 and were lucky to catch the last staff member on his way our or we wouldn't have had a place to stay! Wonderful park for camping, walking and cycling. beautiful time Wonderful park.  Extremely helpful staff.  The ""premium"" camp sites are really amazing.  

Showers and flush toilets within walking distance if that is your thing, but outhouses are clean and well maintained and have fresh water sinks. Camp sites are pretty small, no canoe or kayak rental. Great park with lots to do in it. Staff are awesome  Beautiful provincial park with gorgeous views on Lake Ontario.
Only negative is people washing their dishes at the water taps (Assuming this park lacks the budget to put signs out like any other provincial park we've been to). Nice park. . We'll maintained , great staff! The ice looked awesome. Great picnicing area, on the water and an awesome paved bike trail. I've been going here most of my life and it's a beautiful nature park with much to see and do.    Sadly the camping area, especially High Bluffs, has been taken over by the big rigs who park cross-wise along the lake shore so anyone in ... I've gone here since I was kid. Love it. 
There is lots to do. The bike paths are awesome. The trails are okay. The boardwalk is great, I walk it atleast twice a year. 
 To an outsider it's just a basic campground. 
You need bug spray ... Great mix of Beachs, forest, medow, dunes and wetlands.  Good faculties, polite staff. It was great. Beautiful location and some interesting historical sites. Beaches can be a little windy.  Ok spot for a picnic, 'hiking' trails (I use that term very loosely) were unimpressive. Too often you had to walk along a paved road that had traffic on it. Other times it felt like you were walking through someone's camp site. It was ok, but I wouldn't rush back. Great experience, I will come back for sure. Beautiful park. Unfortunately, due to the level of the water, many spots were flooded and closed at the time of our visit.  Great place An absolute gem in Ontario! Been to this park many times and I have never been disappointed. There are many other parks in Ontario, but if you are looking for a bit of tranquility I recommend it. We like to bike here and take walks. The beach isn't very clean tho. I took my family here to go to the beach to have a fun time, first thing is the website says 11.25$ for a day pass. I was charged 14.50, then we get to the only beach thats open and when we finally get to the actual beach after parking, ... Winter wonderland walk.very scenic Great Park for camping by the Lake Ontario: hiking, swamp trails, abundance of wildlife. Good for staying for a week. You can visit Brighton located near by for one day trip too. Beautiful place for camping or just for the day. Unfortunately almost 50% of the park is flooded due to heavy rain we've been having.  Beautiful sandy beaches, plenty of walking and cycling trails, and fantastic campsites. Tends to get a bit crowded for my taste during peek summer season, but spring and fall can be a cool time to visit, especially during bird migrations. The beach was a little disappointing as well as the cleanliness of the toilets. Great place to see ducks and waterfowl.  I make it a point to visit for the Waterfowl Weekend every year. Love visiting this place. Beautiful sandy beach, rocky shores and escarpment, wildlife,  lots of trails and a marsh boardwalk. Perfect place to relax. The sand at the beach was quite nice and the water stays shallow for quite a long way out, which is good for small kids. There were a lot of seagulls and other birds which results in a lot of bird poo on the beach. A section of the beach ... Great park. Very comfortable walks, lovely picnic areas, easy cycling around park roads. Washrooms clean. So quiet and peaceful. Not quite as pretty as Sandbanks but the beach is MUCH larger.

The water can be a bit crazy too depending on where you choose to swim but the signage is VERY clear.  Beautiful trails and cycling. Beaches are still a little flooded and not a lot of room on the sandy part but the swimming was excellent.  Got in the park with my dog went to the beach 
And  there is no dog sign everywhere. I go to the first trail I find again no dog sign again so I decide to head back and ask for a refund. it was literally 20 min after my ticket said I got ... We stayed one night in June 2013 with an RV. Too short to give a full review but it was clean, quite and the staff were friendly. Definitely worth coming back for a longer stay.
Do take into mind: this is a nature reserve, so that comes ... Amazing beach and lake view A sunny weekday in late September, traveling out of Cobourg. Great place for a walk on a big empty sand beach - only 2? people were in sight over the course of an hour? A few too many Canada geese and seagulls in some spots though. ... Its the most lovely and peaceful place to walk...and to check things out Beautiful park Fun in the Sun Bike along the edge of the lake on 8km paved road, and picnic right where you park. Overnight and day use available Gull island is full of gulls, can only access in the winter. Beautiful camping sites, our lot was private, close to comfort station. Great sandy beach!! Ontario has so much to offer! Either camping or just a day trip Presquile is a beautiful park worth the trip. The marsh boardwalk has been recently redone and there are large open areas right on lake Ontario in the day area. Beautiful Lots to do and see, great clean ammenities We have been camping at Presquile for 14+ years beautiful park. Great staff.  Nice beaches although there is a lot of walking to get to the waters edge from parking.
Nice walking trails.
Park is huge. Ducks paradice This review is soley in regards to beach 1. We attempted to take the family swimming, but opted to leave due to it being covered by goose droppings, and an overwhelming stench (possibly from green algae or organic material on sand, or droppings). Very well setup for camping with lots to do  Awesome beach When you go to some camping place you have expectations. You have things you like to do. And things you don't like. Presqu'ile Park is a nice place, although, to my liking it's a bit crowded. I stayed in a Hidden Valley campground and my ... Nice trails, good park for bicycles. My favourite place for camping. We come here every year. I recommend visiting when they release the monarch butterflies in the autumn. Fantastic park, I've been going here with my family for 20 years and they've got any type of camping/landscape you'd want to explore. Bring bug spray and sunscreen, though the water isn't really good for swimming because it's Lake Ontario and there's not much you can do to feel clean. Very clean facilities, as well as very well separated lots which provide good privacy. Lighthouse and bird-watching are two main features of this park. It also has a nice waterfront, and very easy and not very long hiking trail. But this park is a bit crowded on weekends. Great place to go for a weekend. Trails here are great - a lot of choice for short, family friendly walks. And the lighthouse is definitely worth checking out. Excellent park Wonderful park on shores of Lake Ontario. Very spacious with several camping locations and day beaches. Interesting historical lighthouse. Great park . My only complaint is they need another trailer dumping station. excellent for tent camping. large sites.  quiet. Rock beach nearby by foot. sandbeach within a couple km. Great with familes, soft sand and shallow water. Site #12 is nice and large with lots of room for the kids to play. Gross water...algae filled and so bad my 5 year old wouldnt even enter the water...Great beach. No swimming. Stinky green thick algae so you cannot see the  water...even walked far far far into the water thinking it might clear up further in...nope. Guys loved it Great park for camping. The washroom facilities were clean and beaches were great.  This park is one of my favorite but big disappointment is dumping station. Be prepared to spend long time some times ours in line its very bad worst then anywhere my family 
have been before. Beach was a big disappointment also , lots of ... Lovely park,great views, lots of birds,a lighthouse. Lovely park to spend a lot of time!

Grest camping on Lake  Ontario  What a beautiful place!  best place to get some sun watch some wildlife and people watching  Can't say I enjoy this park. It's too crowded and there isn't to do. Trails are very limited. The one good thing is has going for it is the beach area, but if you have dogs forget about it. You cannot take your dog to the beach there. i love presqu'ile, everything there is amazing and I love my familys yearly camping there What used to be one of my favourite parks in Ontario has now gone to the bottom of my list after our last visit on July 13th to 17th 2014.

My favourite place for the last 28 years! :-) It's a nice park to play in and have picnics Beautiful Best biking trail in Toronto  great bike trails for the family I really liked the place, the forest is great and the beach spots are fantastic for kitesurfing and related sports. Awesome! Love the scenery..trees,water,wildlife and lighthouse It was our first time visiting this park, but we were very disappointed.

Even on the hottest of days you have  a good time as there is a lovely breeze and the water is cool and refreshing.  Lots of nice campsites too. Beautiful park and always well maintained.  Usually pretty busy during the summer months (as per other Provincial parks).  However, if you go past the busy seasons, and get there early enough, you can catch an epic sunrise and the ...

However had lots of large spiders. 
Beautiful convenient beach areas with swimming access. Stunning park! Beautiful nature which lots to do. Highly recommend bringing a bike to enjoy all of it. This is a wonderful provincial park.

There are several hiking trails and some ... Wonderful walk in the light falling snow. Crested a ridge and off to our right were 2 deer. Later we got to watch a rafter of turkeys cross by one of the gazebo/picnic buildings. Beautiful, serene, quiet. Awesome place to be without any disturbance and too much crowd. This is my go to place ! First time at park, and it is INCREDIBLY beautiful. There was a lot of car traffic, but understand that at height of spring or fall bird migration it will be busy. Well worth the drive from Peterborough - plan to visit multiple times in 2019! I love this park because of waterfront sites, the beautiful sunsets and the shale bottom lake you can walk for miles on.

The ... So much to do here for the day! Hiking, museums pebble beach sand beach..great day trip for all ages. Beautiful place... Lots of options for hiking, biking, camping or being at the beach.

I go here at least 3 times a year and stay at the residential side and in the summer the park is wonderful.so much to do outdoors and most of the time I don’t see me parents from the morning to dinner time love this place the only downside is that it is 7 hours from where I live Loved my camping stay here. The facilities were clean, the sites were quiet, and the park of course is gorgeous! 

Only downside was many ""too friendly"" raccoons (sitting on the picnic table with us too friendly! Even with all food in the closed car.) The camp sites are a bit close, but the beach was awesome.  No problems finding a spot to strech out.  Bring your bikes for a good ride around the grounds.  Would go back! Certainly wouldn't hesitate going back. Beautiful scenery and very clean Spent a couple of days here.
Enjoyed the walks and beaches. 
The information centre /museum was worth a visit. 
Worth the entrance fee. Beautiful beaches and hiking trails! The boardwalk trail was a nice walk before swimming. The sand is soft and mostly clean although there were a LOT of flies. Water is beautiful and not deep. A beautiful spot with a stunning view of Lake Ontario...incredible sunsets! Awesome time!!! Firewood sold on site. Excellent place for some nice camping. Clean and commodities! Beaches are very priceless. Feels like Florida ;) Great New Year's day  walk in the marsh boardwalk. Sunshine and +temps. This park has it all... varied sites, shaded and sun, swim in a Great Lake, nice trails (hike and bike) and nearby Brighton doesn't dissapoint. If you're doing hydro, some of the
 posts are far, so a third 30amp cord is a necessity. Quiet, relaxing. Park has basic picnicking facilities including picnic tables, outhouses and recycle/garbage containers along the southernmost shore.(This is not ""Beach #1"" or ""Beach #2"".)The beach by the picnic area is mostly pebbles and small stones. The water is shallow, but the bottom is hard shelving shale layers. A very nice, well maintained place. The beaches are good, but I like the most the picknic are with access to the water. You can find shadow or sun, water for swimming or grass for relaxing, hiking trails. And the plus is that it is not very busy! Great place for a family outting. Educational, beautiful, fun for all ages. Unique landscape features. Fantasticly interesting history and future for this beautiful gem. Come here every year. A pretty nice park. But well visited. Considering the number in the park generally doesn't feel crowded. This weekend it did Great Quiet Park. Big Beach sand area . Beach Area 1,2 is the spot. Has 2 Volleyball nets. Water was good , cleaner as you go little further for adults but not bad for young kids along the shore. Walk to the water from parking area is about 3-5 mins inwards. Overall very good place ! Presqu'ile has always been a favorite place for a group family picnic every year since 5 years. There are sites large enough, but even large sites are sometimes hard to get the unit on. Washrooms are worst in all over Ontario looks they ... Wonderful experience. Due to the drought however, the lake has plant debris washing up earlier than usual (so there is a bit to wade through at the shore right now), but it is a beautiful place. There are walking, biking and ... Great place for camping, stopped here for the night on our road trip, has a very nice marsh board walk. And campsites were well maintained. Regular visitor to this place. Id easily say its the best beach between Montreal and Toronto. Wide beaches, and beautiful nature. Camping here is also excellent. Was a beautiful place for a wet fall walk. Didn't test any the facilities but the trails were nice. I’ve been camping here for 40 years and LOVE it.  There is something for everyone here.  It’s a fantastic place bike riding, hiking, swimming and going to park planned programs. Large well maintained park with wonderful picnic area and two beach areas. Access to the beach is 3/4 minutes walk from the beach parking lot. Don't expect shade in the beach area. Picnic area is very well maintained and very large area. Have access to water but not same as the beach area. Beautiful beach. Great camping. Staff is helpful and pleasant. The marsh boardwalk is a must see. Really pretty provincial park. Lots of very easy walking trails and easily navigable. Lighthouse still under construction. All the washrooms open at this time of the season are outhouse style ones as well (no plumbing!) I really look forward to coming back in the summer and swimming at the many beaches. Great park - we look very our annual trip thanksgiving weekend. Amazing beach.  Not crowded at all on a Sunday afternoon in July.  Camping was quite nice as well.  Big park.  Lots of trails for riding and hiking. Water was weed free today.  Sand was nice also.  They need more picnic tables on the beach.  I saw about 6 on the entire beach. Clean & helpful staff. Very larges beaches with lots of room for families & to play sport like activities. I love the place and the lake. Very good for 15$ entrance fee per car. You can go in and out all day. Its a very large park, and the Park Rangers are normal, they don't sneak up on you out of nowhere and tell you to stop talking like some other parks I've been to.  There are trilliums everywhere, growing alongside the trails, and the ... Great place, however the bathrooms nearest my campsite had not been cleaned for a while. Otherwise it was a great experience, and I hope to go again. Considering it's on lake Ontario it's pretty nice!  They even have little cabins in the park that you can rent Family tradition.
Love this place. Decided to check out some of the trails for an easy hike with the dogs.. Over 6km today.. Phragmites everywhere! Great park. Beauty beach. Clean comfort stations. Park wood is wet and over priced. Go support the locals outside the gate who have dry hardwood for the same price but bigger bags The most beautiful beach I've ever been to. Amazing. Beautiful park and great staff 👍🏼 Nice park for camping, biking or roller blading too. The day use area is nice for parking by the water for a picnic. They could use a better full service bathroom facility in the day use area. Have to drive to the lighthouse for proper bathrooms.

Awesome park, well maintained and lots of fun stuff to do Presqu'ile has always been a favorite place, and this time was no exception. We have
 a 32' fifth wheel, and that size is often a challenge in provincial parks. There are sites large enough, but even large sites are sometimes hard to get the unit on.

Beautiful beach , shallow, clean water..lots of birds, no motorized water craft ..so very quiet Trails, beaches, visitor center, events, guided tours, and the lighthouse, an amazing place.

I'd have given 5 stars if it had a children park with play structure Nice and piecefull place...watch out for racoons! They like to visite :)
I gave 4 cause of the bad smell when camping near the shore close to Gull Island Beautiful scenery. Love to walk the trails. When the sky is clear the view of the stars at night is magnificent. The Beach can be a bit dirty sometimes because it is also a bird sanctuary. Beautiful views in the park. nice birds at lookout#5 The place is nice, not too crowded or noisy.

Great campsites Perfect waterside rv sites One of the best day trips for my family. It is good place for picnic, trail walk, and to enjoy the nature Very nice place ..must visit The park itself is nice, but things that require maintenance are very neglected, the bathrooms in particular. For a provincial park, this is very much sub-par. Great park came early may so everything was a little wet but besides that park seems ok I love this place, can't wait to go back a few times this year! It was a great discovery on a whim! Beautiful a must see.. lots of parking clean washrooms Amazing location, staff friendly, camp sites were great and everything was clean. Just watch out for the racoons they will steal anything even during the day. The campsites are really big and still quite private. Everything is well maintained and clean. The facilities are nice and fairly close. There are outhouse throughout the park as well.

Dog friendly rock beaches are a nice touch.  The park store has a great selection of everything you need including ice cream. The day I was there the beaches were just recovering from flood. It smelled and had a slime all over the beach. Further up into picnic area much nicer and there was a lighthouse to see. This park was large and best to drive around vs. walking. Drive was really awesome, recommend to go early Park is beautiful...book early Stopped here for one night at the start of a trip touring the Great Lakes in Ontario.

I may as well have been camping in the city, in fact I am pretty sure there is a lower population density in downtown Toronto. The park also did not have a lot to offer and the facilities were not the best. However the nature center was quite good and the park staff were great with the kids. Great time camping. Wish there was a comfort station in trails end. The conditions aren't great this year but no fault of the park. They seemed to be working hard to work on the grounds so that campers could enjoy their stay.  Awesome park. Very clean and staff are great. Love going for hikes or something taking a road tour to catch some scenery. Camp ground looks amazing but I live too close to bring myself to do it Great park with good trails Nice camping site, complete with wonderful hot shower Possibly one of the most beautiful provincial parks in Ontario. All seasons are enchanting. There is no BBQ to use in the park on a day pass.  We had called and were advised that there was BBQ available. Had a great day visit this summer. Beach is beautiful. Kids loved jumping in the waves. Good for families. Shallow, sand bar type beach, you can walk out really far and still be only about waist deep. Nice and flat to bike.

It’s a nice, small provincial park, and you can explore some of the trails and beaches in an afternoon. Was very refreshing on a hot day A very nice place to visit, it's clean and beautiful.

Great spot, dinner with a view every night! This park was nice and clean.  We were a group of 10 people on 3 sites and we were able to get them right beside eachother.  The mosquitos were very bad as there was so much flooding last spring.  Bring lots of repellant and an eating tent. We visited this lovely Provincial Park in Ontario in the fall of 2015. The park itself is very well kept and very scenic.. Bring a bicycle however to truly enjoy this large park.. Our only complaint about our visit was during our ... Nice place but shame our province has to nickel and dime us to go to a park. They don't do that in nova scotia, all their provincial parks are free to visit. Nice large beach but dirty water A very nice place to spend time with friends. Nice staff at the shops and museums. Let's put it this way. 30 years ago that beach was amazing. Now not so much. There was a 1 or 2 canteens and a rental booth for water rentals. The sandy beach came all the way to the parking lot. All 4 beaches was loaded with people and ... We camp at Presqu’ile since soooo many years, we go back because we love ce this place.  Also, there is a lot to do around on the wine route or in cambleford north of there.

Both beaches are great for soaking up sun or going for a dip.

Lots of ... So peaceful and beautiful Little gem in Brighton. My favourite is the boardwalk loop over the marsh. Totally accessible which is awesome. Love it.

Very cute, quaint, unique stores downtown for shopping.  Had a great time here. Had a site right by the water. Was super windy but it added to the fun! Clean, not too busy, lovely people and creatures! We picked up firewood from a resident at 300 Lakeshore Rd selling bags on the front lawn. For $5 a bag with generous portions the wood was quality. Look for the white bags and you won't have any complaints.   Great provincial park. My favourite place for a long run, perfect for a bike ride on a hot day since many of the roads are shaded and there's a breeze off the water Always beautiful and full of wildlife. Such a great little provincial park. The campsites are well maintained & there's so much to do and see.  Much of the beach is under water this season (2017).  Still a good option within 2 hours drive from Toronto. When not flooded, its an ideal day-trip option from the GTA. Nice place to relax Surreal place to sight see hike and relax Great place for camping. Beautiful & managed. Friendly staffs. Had a very good time.

One of the best parks around Toronto. Always been a visitor to the beaches there . Day passes are available. We came to see the trees change colors in late September and it was beautiful! The Marsh Boardwalk Trail is simply stunning! We were lucky because the summer season was over and there weren't that many people. Beautiful park, great for looking for fossils! Both information centres are fun and interesting. Nice and well maintained park! A bit colder and windy compare to other park, because it's near the water! I love this park!

Spent a marvelous day with our daughter and granddaughter great park all ways something to do there This park is a good location for Torontonians who want to experience nature, but don't want to drive too far out of the City.

We stopped, however the rangers came to our campsite about every ... Wonderful experience! Love this park. Great trails and campsites and the beach is great. Very shallow sandy bottom. Great for young kids. Have camped here in the fall a couple years and found it a pleasant experience. Right at the lake makes for a beautiful backdrop.

Close to stores in Brighton for supplies,  and only 20 minutes to Trenton for a wider store selection.  Nice Beach Great Camping Experience Early in the Season

The end of April is a hard time to find a campground in Canada and Presqu'ile Provincial Park opened early in the season giving us an opportunity to enjoy a few days hiking and birdwatching in a peaceful environment. Arrived the day after Labour Day and the Park Store, Nature Center and 2/3 of the beach access points were closed for the season.  Staff were only there from 8AM-4PM through the week.  We arrived at 4:30 and were lucky to catch the last staff member on his way our or we wouldn't have had a place to stay! Wonderful park for camping, walking and cycling. beautiful time Wonderful park.  Extremely helpful staff.  The ""premium"" camp sites are really amazing.  

Showers and flush toilets within walking distance if that is your thing, but outhouses are clean and well maintained and have fresh water sinks. Camp sites are pretty small, no canoe or kayak rental. Great park with lots to do in it. Staff are awesome  Beautiful provincial park with gorgeous views on Lake Ontario.
Only negative is people washing their dishes at the water taps (Assuming this park lacks the budget to put signs out like any other provincial park we've been to). Nice park. . We'll maintained , great staff! The ice looked awesome. Great picnicing area, on the water and an awesome paved bike trail. I've been going here most of my life and it's a beautiful nature park with much to see and do.    Sadly the camping area, especially High Bluffs, has been taken over by the big rigs who park cross-wise along the lake shore so anyone in ... I've gone here since I was kid. Love it. 
There is lots to do. The bike paths are awesome. The trails are okay. The boardwalk is great, I walk it atleast twice a year. 
 To an outsider it's just a basic campground. 
You need bug spray ... Great mix of Beachs, forest, medow, dunes and wetlands.  Good faculties, polite staff. It was great. Beautiful location and some interesting historical sites. Beaches can be a little windy.  Ok spot for a picnic, 'hiking' trails (I use that term very loosely) were unimpressive. Too often you had to walk along a paved road that had traffic on it. Other times it felt like you were walking through someone's camp site. It was ok, but I wouldn't rush back. Great experience, I will come back for sure. Beautiful park. Unfortunately, due to the level of the water, many spots were flooded and closed at the time of our visit.  Great place An absolute gem in Ontario! Been to this park many times and I have never been disappointed. There are many other parks in Ontario, but if you are looking for a bit of tranquility I recommend it. We like to bike here and take walks. The beach isn't very clean tho. I took my family here to go to the beach to have a fun time, first thing is the website says 11.25$ for a day pass. I was charged 14.50, then we get to the only beach thats open and when we finally get to the actual beach after parking, ... Winter wonderland walk.very scenic Great Park for camping by the Lake Ontario: hiking, swamp trails, abundance of wildlife. Good for staying for a week. You can visit Brighton located near by for one day trip too. Beautiful place for camping or just for the day. Unfortunately almost 50% of the park is flooded due to heavy rain we've been having.  Beautiful sandy beaches, plenty of walking and cycling trails, and fantastic campsites. Tends to get a bit crowded for my taste during peek summer season, but spring and fall can be a cool time to visit, especially during bird migrations. The beach was a little disappointing as well as the cleanliness of the toilets. Great place to see ducks and waterfowl.  I make it a point to visit for the Waterfowl Weekend every year. Love visiting this place. Beautiful sandy beach, rocky shores and escarpment, wildlife,  lots of trails and a marsh boardwalk. Perfect place to relax. The sand at the beach was quite nice and the water stays shallow for quite a long way out, which is good for small kids. There were a lot of seagulls and other birds which results in a lot of bird poo on the beach. A section of the beach ... Great park. Very comfortable walks, lovely picnic areas, easy cycling around park roads. Washrooms clean. So quiet and peaceful. Not quite as pretty as Sandbanks but the beach is MUCH larger.

The water can be a bit crazy too depending on where you choose to swim but the signage is VERY clear.  Beautiful trails and cycling. Beaches are still a little flooded and not a lot of room on the sandy part but the swimming was excellent.  Got in the park with my dog went to the beach 
And  there is no dog sign everywhere. I go to the first trail I find again no dog sign again so I decide to head back and ask for a refund. it was literally 20 min after my ticket said I got ...

Overnight and day use available Gull island is full of gulls, can only access in the winter. Beautiful camping sites, our lot was private, close to comfort station. Great sandy beach!! Ontario has so much to offer! Either camping or just a day trip Presquile is a beautiful park worth the trip. The marsh boardwalk has been recently redone and there are large open areas right on lake Ontario in the day area. Beautiful Lots to do and see, great clean ammenities We have been camping at Presquile for 14+ years beautiful park. Great staff.  Nice beaches although there is a lot of walking to get to the waters edge from parking.
Nice walking trails.
Park is huge. Ducks paradice This review is soley in regards to beach 1. We attempted to take the family swimming, but opted to leave due to it being covered by goose droppings, and an overwhelming stench (possibly from green algae or organic material on sand, or droppings). Very well setup for camping with lots to do  Awesome beach When you go to some camping place you have expectations. You have things you like to do. And things you don't like. Presqu'ile Park is a nice place, although, to my liking it's a bit crowded. I stayed in a Hidden Valley campground and my ... Nice trails, good park for bicycles. My favourite place for camping. We come here every year. I recommend visiting when they release the monarch butterflies in the autumn. Fantastic park, I've been going here with my family for 20 years and they've got any type of camping/landscape you'd want to explore. Bring bug spray and sunscreen, though the water isn't really good for swimming because it's Lake Ontario and there's not much you can do to feel clean. Very clean facilities, as well as very well separated lots which provide good privacy. Lighthouse and bird-watching are two main features of this park. It also has a nice waterfront, and very easy and not very long hiking trail. But this park is a bit crowded on weekends. Great place to go for a weekend. Trails here are great - a lot of choice for short, family friendly walks. And the lighthouse is definitely worth checking out. Excellent park Wonderful park on shores of Lake Ontario. Very spacious with several camping locations and day beaches. Interesting historical lighthouse. Great park . My only complaint is they need another trailer dumping station. excellent for tent camping. large sites.  quiet. Rock beach nearby by foot. sandbeach within a couple km. Great with familes, soft sand and shallow water. Site #12 is nice and large with lots of room for the kids to play. Gross water...algae filled and so bad my 5 year old wouldnt even enter the water...Great beach. No swimming. Stinky green thick algae so you cannot see the  water...even walked far far far into the water thinking it might clear up further in...nope. Guys loved it Great park for camping.

You cannot take your dog to the beach there. i love presqu'ile, everything there is amazing and I love my familys yearly camping there What used to be one of my favourite parks in Ontario has now gone to the bottom of my list after our last visit on July 13th to 17th 2014.

Playground on site. So quiet and peaceful here. Will definitely come back again. Great handicapped spots go pull in a trailer. The park seemes to be run by students. After vague instructions where our pitch was, We drove around for ages trying to find it! Signage poor. We weren’t aware we had to fill water tank at dump station. Noisy, we were next to a road. Washrooms were dirty too. The river is nearby and very nice. It is a very nice place to spend with family and friends, even if you want to be alone for the day, this is a good place to go read and or lay down on the beach, running or just bike. Also there is an area to camp. The previous review perfectly describes our experience at this park - A group of people laughing, singing and chatting around a campfire who were given a $180 noise violation ticket.

Great for pick-nicks and simple water sports. Small, clean beach, friendly staff. Clean bathrooms. Campsites are a good size. Fireworks and the Tulip festival.
Always a good plan for the kiddos. Been to a lot of parks but, this has by far been the most problematic.

But they should make price lower for daily  visitors . Well serviced and maintained campground but not a lot to do and rather close to the highway.

Great place for family gatherings, well kept. Very nice park with beautiful beach Good private campsites. Great amenities. Beautiful wild life Great place for a swim and play in the sun. Good privacy, good comfort stations, close to amenities. A nice place to camp close to Ottawa. I enjoyed and appreciated the kayak rentals. This place is great for groups as the camp sites are close together. It's a nice camping site close to a beautiful  town Kempville that means it's convinient for shopping ( 5 minute distance), but a bit loud due to traffic if you camp near the roadside. Recommend riverside. Been here many times. Wonderful memories. Nice park overall, good beach and surrounding area. Nice dock area to fish from. Could use a few more washrooms but not a deal breaker. Two parks for the kids to play at, both within a few minutes walk from one another. Would camp there again, no problem... The park is great but yesterday August 6, there was no water in the park at all, means no washrooms, when it did come back on it was no drinkable, boil first warnings. Dogs admitted for pets lovers.

There were 2 bathrooms and 4 showers though, so there was always a lineup for the bathrooms none for ... A good quick getaway from the Ottawa area. Basic park, but lots to do in the area, and good access to watersports. Wonderful place Nice clean park,  helpful staff Great time and family experience!!

Prices are high for not much of anything.  Park is small ... i would not bring kids because they would get bored fast! great private spot near the Rideau River. Did some work there but seemed like a nice park Amazing!!!!!!!! My family and I love this campground. Staff are always extra friendly, beaches are nice and clean, boat ramp is close and convenient. Great having a park store, my kids love a daily ice cream :) The park is good but the mosquitoes are really bad as soon as you get away from the beach. Avoid bug season if you can. This park is not up to the regular standards of the provincial parks. The camp sites are not maintained. As soon as it rains they are flooded with water. Mud everywhere. Lots of bugs because of standing water. The garbage collection area ... Decent place for a quick weekend out of the city but not much privacy between the campsites. Great walking path next to the water though  Went camping by myself and had a plot on a section where I was the only one. It was a very nice sized and laid out plot with ample space for my 8 person tent as well as the picnic table and fire pit. Services provided were excellent. The ... Not bad. Great camping spot, and fantastic for cross country skiing during the winter.  We really enjoy our time there. When we booked out site, the online reservation system showed 2 sites available, both closer to the road away from the water.  After we set up on a very small, narrow and uneven site and started to explore, we realized that half the ... Beautiful park however, very weedy for swimming Some sites are hard to get trailer into. Love the views, and the friendly service. We also love the setting of the park with playground, hiking trails, boating dock and swimming areas. However, we were disappointed that we couldn't swim due to the bacteria notice. So we rented out the canoe and fishing rods and went fishing instead.  Generally clean.  Lots are large and very nice.  We do tent camping and it was ideal.  Beach is nice as well.   The camp ground is however lacking in facilities.  Bathrooms are clean but lineups were long.  For the size of the park I ... very disappointing.  The beach sections were extremely small and water would only go up to your waist at best, not bad if you have very young children.  The section that was designated for ""dogs"" wasn't even accessible, you had to go ... The week we were here it was very quiet even though our section was full, staff were great to deal with. Poor example of a provincial park, no park staff were available over our entire visit, no map, no firewood, and nobody was available to check in with. Pretty noisy as well with the road on one side and the boats on the river. I'll skip this one next time. When We came there on May 21st, park closed. We parked our car outside and walked in. It is good for family or group gathering. No trail. Heavy mosquitos. Nice and clean campgrounds with clean amenities. Picturesque water front. It's less then an hour from Ottawa and is a great provincial park! The  sites are great lots of privacy. The campground has very poor drainage leading to very muddy sites and a heavy presence of mosquitos. The lack of natural drainage is compounded by the facility's failure to maintain ditches; the remnants of ditches can be seen in some places.  Excellent park ! Lovely water...no racoons and the mosquitoes were manageable.🙃 Beautiful river. Nice scenery. Alot of bugs though We had a fun weekend with the family.  Nice site, flat and shaded.  Near the water and still near the washrooms (which were clean, always a good thing).  Close by to all stores.  We hope to return Absolutely beautiful, visited in spring and it was gorgeous but muddy would great for a family camping trip or even a nice walk.  Beautiful and tranquil. Perfect place for camping  Awesome place! Swimming area has nice sand. Lots of bugs but that is to be expected in the woods Nice friendly staff great beach lots of picnic table  Very beautiful and quiet park ,kids can play and swim Large, flat camping spaces. Very nice park.  Our site was flooded when we got there and the moved us!! Spacious campsites. The park rangers were always on the lookout for and rowdy or noisy campers and quickly put an end to it. Sires are kept clean and the washrooms and showers, although they could be crowded were kept clean. Beautiful park. Rangers patrolled regularly, quieting folks at night. Good kid programing, nice sites. What a fun spot- lots to do, fishing courses for kids, and nice beach. Clean well kept..staff is so kind Family oriented provincial park on the banks of the Rideau with a nice Beach The bathroom smells awful.  The beach is nearly non existent and I'm pretty sure mosquitoes were invented here.  Not worth the $14 entry fee It was nice, only down fall was other people coming and going who disregarded the max speed which was 20ks, my daughter whos 4 who ran ahead of me nearly got hit by an idiot going 40. We were right by the washrooms and showers and the beach was lovely.  Parking is expensive, and to reserve a picnic spot is also very expensive. Washrooms are not checked during the day and are disgusting!!! Night wardens were two younger people, very rude. Were the only site occupied in our section and kept pestering us.  Love this place Neat and Clean Nice place and decent beach. Clean facilities! Campsites are pretty close to the water, close to Kemptville but not too close. Camp sites do not have very much privacy and swimming is only good for small children. Good park for a quick weekend getaway  Great spot! Just out of the city it was close but far enough to get away for a night or two!  Sites are a nice size and the river is good around there.  Some sites are close to a busy highway which is annoying at night It was just an okay campsite. The grounds were uneven and when it rained there was a collection of puddles. The beaches are full of water weeds and the main beach was pretty small and shallow. Other than that the facilities were great, good maintenance, and garbage pick up was often. A busy but very nice place to camp or visit. Amazing location.  Great beach,  big electrical sites Great place to camp out and stay Never disappoints, but then again, I am a camping fanatic!  Stunning view and perfect location for family swims and barbeque Nice park on the Rideau. Bit of road noise to deal with. Not a big park. Camping is okay too. Perfect for children. Water is not deep.

Enjoy family camping on nice level, shaded campsites with all of the amenities nearby
Great base for exploring Ottawa; only 40 minutes away or the small towns that line the Rideau.
Explore the waters of the Rideau by canoe or motorboat; perhaps fish for muskie or bassPlace is well kept and maintained. Bathrooms we're dry, clean. The Park persons had bird spotting informative activity for kids. The camp site was good too. It can be great place for a day trip or picnic with family and friends. Parking fee/entry fee is about $15.00. It's a very good place for a family kids. You can do a lot of activities are there are two beaches for swimming. There's no lifeguard but the water is pretty shallow.
There are campgrounds different campgrounds in this area you can go ... was a little hard to find at first, but being our first time out here from alaska what do you expect right? quiet campground and well maintained. we will keep it on our list of nice RV parks to stay at! Just on the outskirts of Ottawa, perfect if you just want to get away for a night or the weekend.  One side of the park is close to the highway, so a bit noisy at night.  Wood is kept in a dry place.  Only has one 3km hike.  Large beach. Quiet but small park. Wish I could have swam but the bacteria levels were too high. The prices of kayak rentals are honestly way too high so no one was on the water. The facilities are decent. But there isn't much to do without ... Amazing Park, love the location. Very small amounts of mosquitoes. The sites are very reasonably sized. Small beach, very shallow water, lots of seaweed. Small gift shop available at the front entrance. Bathrooms were very busy as there were not many and they were quite dirty. Nice camping sites and nice trail. The beach was very shallow, good for kids and bad for teens/ adults. The park's water went out on our last day. We will not be returning. Good beach right close to Ottawa West and relaxed environment This place is a great place for family and friends to get together,have fun and get closer to them. Lot of area , camping sites, and playgrounds for the kids to get out of your hair if need be. I love it there and so does my family. Just outside of Ottawa and easy to get to. This local campground has some great facilities and a solid beach, for the Rideau River of course. The only downside is how close it is to a busy road, so when in your tent at night, you can really hear the cars. Other than that, we always have a great time. Nice shaded private campsites, cool playground, great picnic areas. The beach is tiny and shallow. More like a large bath tub than a place to swim. My friends got a site at this location and invited me to come up for the day.  I went to check in at the office and ask what I need to do as my friends had a site and see my options. The young man there was very nice and told me to do ... Great beach access with picnic tables for a family outing. I would give it a 5 out of 5 if it had access to any food.

Clean and relaxing place. I was so impressed with this provincial park. Campsites are very nice and clean. Sites are big enough for small group to play games. The Site we had was having good privacy and washrooms were close enough. Beach of this provincial park ... Absolutely beautiful! Fossils and shells are fascinating to explore! Rock platforms and ledges are fun to walk out on or sit/lay in the sun We were charmed, incredible camping site. We had so much fun playing in the waves at the beach. Always a fantastic family walk. The views and the nature are abundant. Beautiful place, friendly staff. Nice large sites. Beautiful beach but lots of pebbles so you need some water shoes.
Only concern is the many pot wholes they need to be filled. I have been very disappointed in this park this camping season. Things have been let go, there doesn't seem to be any interest in making the campers happy. Policies have either been put into place or all of a sudden now being enforced ... Fantastic little park.  They have two very different waterfronts to see in the park - a fossil beach and a rocky gravel sort of beach.  The fossil beach has a number of fossils in the rock and a layer of seashells closing the entire ... Lovely place. The shore is not sandy but water is shallow and sand is on the bottom. Nice short hikes in the park. Great for families with smaller kids. Bicycles are good option to take. nice camping place.  be warned at lookout area. it is not sand or rocks. it is seashells. don't wear open toed shoes. as well as beach, bring water shoes, sharp rocks but lovely beach Absolutely beautiful. Obey the rules of the park so generations to come will be able to enjoy this beautiful place Super fun hidden gem. Off the beaten path while visiting Niagara. Kids loved it. We found a little secret spot to jump off some rocks in to the water. Nice Beach. nice, easy walking trails. Kayaking/canoeing available in nearby dunnville. Site was nice. Camp ground. Good lake. Park facilities excellent for campers. Would like to go in coming years. Huge camp sites and very nice beach....friendly staff, clean facilities.... will go back. Highly recommended for young families. They do great kids activities We love camping here with the kids. We go May long weekend and October long weekend. Been doing this for 5 years now. It's becoming a family tradition. Highly recommend! Love it here in the fall. It's the perfect time to visit. If you come in September you will witness the monarch butterflies migrating through the park along with countless birds. The beach isn't great to swim in so that's why we try to hit this park in the odd season Great for biking, hiking, fossil hunting and general exploration.  Nice sites, generally clean park. Overall this is a good Park for the rate they charge. Somethings that stand out:

1) They have really clean washrooms that are maintained daily. Sites are in good condition and regularly maintained. They even offer shower rooms which are ... Great campground it like your up north with the rock face Was there not even 12-hours and got evicted for being loud. No noise warnings, just evicted. The park rangers were extremely unreasonable. Was not able to get money back. There is a much better parks around the area. Luv luv luv this place great for families & or groups. Family had a blast Parks good, nice sites, friendly staff and other campers.  Spent 6 days here with a family of five from June 18th to June 23rd.  Also have my in-laws and my other friend. Making a total of three separate families on three separate sites. ... Been going here since I was born. Not necessarily as nice as other camp grounds and entering the water is super rocky but it's still nice! Very nice park! My biggest beef? No water on site and electrical is 100 ft away.  Lots of trees tho. Great place for day at the beach.
But waves can be sometimes big for smaller kids Quiet hidden gem. Great location to ride a bicycle on the trails. Crystal clear water . Love this park bring deet.  Water is clean comfort station was good.  Beach was good. Quiet family oriented park.      Washrooms and showers coould be cleaned a little more and water shoes recommended for rocky beach. It's no doubt a beautiful place with amazing view. But this time I wasn't happy. Paid $14 for parking for just visiting beach. Grounds were all marshy and muddy. Park and picnic place wasn't maintained. In my opinion they should lower the parking fee for short time visitors or at least maintain the park. Love this place, we go every year!! Really great park for a day trip to the beach on Lake Erie. My family absolutely adores this park it is great atmosphere very easygoing and we can't wait to go back Rock Point is my favorite place to go for a day on the beach.plenty of green space and nice, clean water. I just wish they have more picknic tables. Beautiful. Beach where we were starts out rocky, but got to nice sand further out. I cutted my foot with all those shells. Just remember to keep your shoes on :) Beautiful park. Sites was a great size and day use park is amazing and shady. The beach is kinda dirty... I found a needle, glass, lots of sharp objects... lots of dead fish wash ashore which is a health hazard if a dog eats it. I remember years ago the staff at Rock Point used to have a bunch of large tractors ... It's ridiculous that Rock Point Provincial Park charges the same rate for a motorcycle with two wheels and 1 rider as a full size  F350 Truck with 5 people in the truck . You can fit 6 bikes in the same space that an F350 Truck foot ... Nice view and picnic spots, the beach is very pebbly though. Easy car camping, especially with kids Worth visiting was welcomed by three deer I did not like how there was seaweed everywhere and cold as a beach it is not good but for hiking great Nice area. Other campers were disrespectful of park rules. Made it frustrating and not as enjoyable. Front desk person was very disorganized, she lost the reservation. When finally found we had to jump through hoops to figure everything out.

We've returned to this park for 3 years now and always go to the same spot. They have a dog beach and sites within minutes of the beach. There is a family who provides dry wood and kindling just outside the grounds for very reasonable ... Stayed Friday/Saturday/Sunday of August long weekend.  Very friendly staff. Was a good spot for my dog, though people let off fireworks that she didn't care for (but no ones fault). One thing I will say is that our camp site (52) had a ... Beautiful beach. Lovely woods. Perfect place Sites are very secluded from one another. They are all fairly large, and well maintained. For a campground, The showers are great! The nearby town of dunnville has many cool and unique shops and restaurants. The campground is 1hr from ... Good for group camping and close to the beach, which is kind of rocky.

Friendly staff and visitors. Park store located on the beach with all necessities (plus hot food and ice cream). This park has all amenities needed for city folk who need a little nature. Rates are fair for sites, going for the day is ... Great Place for Hiking & our Dogs The water is beautiful! It's never super crowded, even on a holiday. Love this place!! Beautiful beach with dog allow area. No East Asian people yet. 2 hr from Toronto The facilities are rudamentar, and at first it seems not worth a fee. But it's never crowded especially on working days, and that's the best thing about it. The sound of the waves when you go to sleep.  Nice big area for picnic day trip. Nice little provincial park on the north shore of Lake Erie. A lot less crowded than Long Point and Turkey Point. Camp sites offer good privacy. Campers seemed to be more friendly and less rowdy than other parks we've been to.  Great beach !! Quiet compared to some other parks. Amazing view of Sunset..don't miss. Nice to camp Very nice.

Beach wasn't as sandy as I had hired for Nice treed sizable tenting sites. Substantial fire pits. Beach is rather rocky and dog friendly beach a fair hike away. Easy water access, playgrounds, bathrooms like any other provincial park. Very swampy experience had to leave early due to being a mud pit not very happy as I had to call a tow truck to get my awd SUV and trailer out of the camp site. Nice sites, some quite private. Great lake access. Be aware that the park closes early on long weekends and do not allow you in after 6:30 No debris in the water but it's murky. Tricky to get in due to large pebbles.

Plus side is no heading down the 400 to get to the lake.  One of our favourite Provincial Parks! Great park, beaches are a bit small although you can get a very nice view of Lake Erie. A beautiful spot on Lake Erie. One of the best camping places to go. Nice for the proximity to GTA, very strict wardens at this park though, don't fart after 11 if you don't want trouble.

Very rocky beach beautiful lake erie Nice place Very nice location.

Was fined and evicted for excessive noise for talking at the camp fire. 6 campsites were evicted which they told me was i record, i guess security was in a bad mood. We left and  went to a conservation park much better and cleaner! Not a huge campground on the shore of Lake Erie.  Clean, quiet and quaint.

The Site we had was having good privacy and washrooms were close enough. Beach of this provincial park ... Absolutely beautiful! Fossils and shells are fascinating to explore! Rock platforms and ledges are fun to walk out on or sit/lay in the sun We were charmed, incredible camping site. We had so much fun playing in the waves at the beach. Always a fantastic family walk. The views and the nature are abundant. Beautiful place, friendly staff. Nice large sites. Beautiful beach but lots of pebbles so you need some water shoes.
Only concern is the many pot wholes they need to be filled. I have been very disappointed in this park this camping season. Things have been let go, there doesn't seem to be any interest in making the campers happy. Policies have either been put into place or all of a sudden now being enforced ... Fantastic little park.

The beach isn't great to swim in so that's why we try to hit this park in the odd season Great for biking, hiking, fossil hunting and general exploration.  Nice sites, generally clean park. Overall this is a good Park for the rate they charge. Somethings that stand out:

1) They have really clean washrooms that are maintained daily. Sites are in good condition and regularly maintained. They even offer shower rooms which are ... Great campground it like your up north with the rock face Was there not even 12-hours and got evicted for being loud. No noise warnings, just evicted. The park rangers were extremely unreasonable.

Water is clean comfort station was good.  Beach was good. Quiet family oriented park.      Washrooms and showers coould be cleaned a little more and water shoes recommended for rocky beach. It's no doubt a beautiful place with amazing view. But this time I wasn't happy. Paid $14 for parking for just visiting beach. Grounds were all marshy and muddy. Park and picnic place wasn't maintained. In my opinion they should lower the parking fee for short time visitors or at least maintain the park. Love this place, we go every year!! Really great park for a day trip to the beach on Lake Erie. My family absolutely adores this park it is great atmosphere very easygoing and we can't wait to go back Rock Point is my favorite place to go for a day on the beach.plenty of green space and nice, clean water.

Nice and sandy not like sone places where you find nothing but rocks Outhouses smelled better than the bathrooms, flies biting all day long, mosquitoes too.  Have been to much nicer parks won't go back Quiet and well kept without too much fuss. I was there in June, though. This is one of my favourite campgrounds as there are not many provincial parks in southern Ontario. The campsites are a nice size and if you go in the fall you will have almost the whole park to yourself. The trails to the point are also nice to bike on and the bay offers a nice area to kayak Lots of bugs, but that's not their fault haha. Great place to bring the whole family My experience today was absolutely amazing great for bike riding. Always fun Reason for 3 stars, went off season.

I enjoy this place Amazing park with interesting habitats and fauna. One of the best places for the Prothonotary Warbler. Beautiful land with great access to Lake Erie. Enjoying Rondeau is like being in paradise; sun, sand, clean water for swimming, boating, water skiing, sailing or kayaking, building sand castles, book reading, trails for hiking, or white sandy beaches. There is hiking, bicycling, bird watching, tennis courts, ice cream stores and more and I love it. I love this place This park is nice for biking. Great park for cycling, and natural beauty! Great park, the only negative thing is there are some lots without threes My family and I have been coming here for 40+ years and my parents/families even longer. Its a wonderful place to visit.

Beautiful park with a great history The site claimed to be good privacy, but really had nothing separating any of the sites (ie. no overgrowth), so we felt very close to other campers. Although there's a sound policy in the park, we didn't realize it was so close to the ... I love this place...we've had cottage since 1925.  Though the enviro-nut from the MNR are trying to kick us out.  Camping sucks Awesome for birders! Beware though that Victoria Day weekend the park is so riddled with partying teenagers that they actually had a police mobile unit and at least 15 or so patrollers throughout the park. If looking to book this weekend ... Beautiful park, lots to see! Beautiful park. Great historic feeling. A lot of wild life.  Nice board walks, clean washrooms and well maintained trails.  Nice provincial park. Water is clean and shallow. Great family place and picnic site. You can also fire up a barbeque at certain places. Spice trail and Tulip trail never disappoint Shallow water and lots of weeds. Great family swimming I was there and 1 of the showers on Beach Road didn't have any hot water We ended up visiting on a day that had free admission so that was a huge bonus. Great beaches, lots of trails, campsites are very generous. I like this place for family camping.   Store is OK but not massive, proximity to the beach is wonderful.  Lake Erie is shallow and sandy so water depth is absolutely not an issue until you are very far from shore which can be good.  The ... A so so experience.

Well kept and lots of trails to walk. Nice beach and trail Lots of changes and updating:) $17 for a day pass is outrageous Edited, found camp store was closed. Not that we rely on it but if your park is open everything should be open. Felt they should just close for the season if they only wanted to halfass it. If you  go maybe during the peak summers months ... Nice park! Beautiful sunsets on the bay side, sandy beach, lots of roaď to ride your bikes safely and the park store restaurant has some nice take out for the people looking for a quick bite or ice cream This is not the Pinery. Kind of expensive. Not kept up like it used to be. No charging facilities for electric cars. You would think that Al the provincial parks would have that. Good beach, kids activities, clean bathrooms.  I wish the sites were more private. Great family environment. Lots of hiking, and very scenic being on the lake. Beautiful park Beautiful place An amazing park to camp and bike ride. Extremely large beach for swimming and dogs separate from the main beach and Rondeau Bay.  Absolutely amazing place to go camping the wildlife Is stunning and it's just very beautiful  Poor campsites (extreme slopes/small sites) with no privacy - disappointing Provincial Park!  Great Park to go camping, swimming, or going for a run along the trails as it is near Chatham so you can just camp here for the weekend and drive home. Lots of biking few trails not very good canoeing unless you want to canoe in Lake Huron This is a wonderful camp with good campsites. The mosquito's can be a problem so come prepared with an screened room and bug spray. A M A Z I N G !!! Harrison trail is the best one of the park, it leads to a beautiful sandy beach and other interesting spots ... I wouldn't recommend to complete the Marsh trail passing the observation tower ... it's a bit monotonous and not rewarding at the end ... we had an exhausting but memorable time 👌🏽 Love this park Nice park. The route that walks along the point has been washed out but it still makes for a nice, fairly relaxed, stroll. 
$17 just to park your car though! Park nearby and get there by bike. Nice park with lots of trails for hiking and biking. Also there are endless sandy beaches along the Erie shoreline. There is also nice bay on the other side of the park. It is not deep and what're is flat most of the times which makes it very nice place fir vindsurfing or kiteboarding. Great place to take the family. Have a picnic, go for bike ride, boating, fishing, hiking ect. The only down fall is the cost to get in the park is too high Very nice long sandy beach perfect for sand castles, etc.  Excellent rustic camping, great facilities, reasonable price per night. Biking, hiking, paddling, family picnics, camping, education and outreach, learn about nature, plants and animals.
Knowledgeable, helpful staff.

Beautiful hiking trails and great fishing in Rondeau Bay! Good place for relaxing Nice place A hidden gem! Great dog beach and a lot of beautiful trails.

Nice and sandy not like sone places where you find nothing but rocks Outhouses smelled better than the bathrooms, flies biting all day long, mosquitoes too.  Have been to much nicer parks won't go back Quiet and well kept without too much fuss. I was there in June, though. This is one of my favourite campgrounds as there are not many provincial parks in southern Ontario. The campsites are a nice size and if you go in the fall you will have almost the whole park to yourself. The trails to the point are also nice to bike on and the bay offers a nice area to kayak Lots of bugs, but that's not their fault haha. Great place to bring the whole family My experience today was absolutely amazing great for bike riding. Always fun Reason for 3 stars, went off season. Unimpressed with enteu fee just to drive through to see if it would be summer destination for us.
Understand they need cash flow but it was days end, just wanted to take a quick peek at campsites and ... Great birding opportunities, trails camping and a pebbled beach. Love coming here. Although a lot of the board walks have been destroyed by ice over the winters and are not being replaced. Very nice park. Nice long trails for bike riding or walking. Well maintained with lots of wildlife. The windsurfers were awesome to watch. Endless amounts of beach. Purple sand at some of the beach spots was so cool. Beautiful place we will be back again soon. I enjoy this place Amazing park with interesting habitats and fauna. One of the best places for the Prothonotary Warbler. Beautiful land with great access to Lake Erie. Enjoying Rondeau is like being in paradise; sun, sand, clean water for swimming, boating, water skiing, sailing or kayaking, building sand castles, book reading, trails for hiking, or white sandy beaches. There is hiking, bicycling, bird watching, tennis courts, ice cream stores and more and I love it. I love this place This park is nice for biking. Great park for cycling, and natural beauty! Great park, the only negative thing is there are some lots without threes My family and I have been coming here for 40+ years and my parents/families even longer. Its a wonderful place to visit. Even if just for a day, weekend or camp for week or longer. Lots of activities to do. You have lake erie on one side ... It is nice quite place to relax and make barbecue We went there for camping. It was really nice and, we really enjoyed our time. We visited the pet beach, which was sandy and beautiful. The walking trails were good too.  Nice hiking trails! I liked it here, nice place with lots of stuff to do. Long hiking trails and beautiful scenery. The camp grounds aren't as private as a lot of other parks but still decent. Bathrooms were always close by and so were showers. The lake ... Always a relaxing time. Always a special place to reconnect with friends and family. Such an interesting place from the field naturalist point of view.  Tons of wildlife, birds etc.  Even saw a turtle digging a nest!  Great beaches and trails and the ice cream store stays open until 9pm. ☺ Very nice place for group camping in summer $17.50 ENTRANCE FEE...very expensive...bathrooms filthy...smelled aweful This Park is great. Excellent facilities and friendly staff.  The dog beach is also great, not too busy and has a nice sandy beach front. I will be coming back. Great place to enjoy nature. Good facilities.  Park is not very large. There are permanent home in the park as well. Nice park ,clean and friendly Camp here quite often. Friendly clean campground. A wonderful place to visit! Excellent beaches, nice camp grounds and just a really pleasant ""bygone"" feel to the place; reminds me of that place in Jaws (but without the killer sharks) Beautiful park. Beautiful park with a great history The site claimed to be good privacy, but really had nothing separating any of the sites (ie. no overgrowth), so we felt very close to other campers. Although there's a sound policy in the park, we didn't realize it was so close to the ... I love this place...we've had cottage since 1925.  Though the enviro-nut from the MNR are trying to kick us out.  Camping sucks Awesome for birders! Beware though that Victoria Day weekend the park is so riddled with partying teenagers that they actually had a police mobile unit and at least 15 or so patrollers throughout the park. If looking to book this weekend ... Beautiful park, lots to see! Beautiful park. Great historic feeling. A lot of wild life.  Nice board walks, clean washrooms and well maintained trails.  Nice provincial park. Water is clean and shallow. Great family place and picnic site. You can also fire up a barbeque at certain places. Spice trail and Tulip trail never disappoint Shallow water and lots of weeds. Great family swimming I was there and 1 of the showers on Beach Road didn't have any hot water We ended up visiting on a day that had free admission so that was a huge bonus. Great beaches, lots of trails, campsites are very generous. I like this place for family camping.   Store is OK but not massive, proximity to the beach is wonderful.  Lake Erie is shallow and sandy so water depth is absolutely not an issue until you are very far from shore which can be good.  The ... A so so experience. Most of campsites are in full sun and fire cannot be moved to change their location. no other tree is planted to replace those who were uprooted. the full bins were not collected during our week and the smell was ... We love this place! Amazing trails, lots of beaches too! Nice place to fish Love the cottage here Just visited the bay, shallow water and lots of weeds. Good campsite and beach Beautiful place. This place is amazing I've been coming here for the last 28 years off and on Champ! You will see EVERYTHING there.... Beautiful. No exception. Love camping here.  Well kept and lots of trails to walk. Nice beach and trail Lots of changes and updating:) $17 for a day pass is outrageous Edited, found camp store was closed. Not that we rely on it but if your park is open everything should be open. Felt they should just close for the season if they only wanted to halfass it. If you  go maybe during the peak summers months ... Nice park! Beautiful sunsets on the bay side, sandy beach, lots of roaď to ride your bikes safely and the park store restaurant has some nice take out for the people looking for a quick bite or ice cream This is not the Pinery. Kind of expensive. Not kept up like it used to be. No charging facilities for electric cars. You would think that Al the provincial parks would have that. Good beach, kids activities, clean bathrooms.  I wish the sites were more private. Great family environment. Lots of hiking, and very scenic being on the lake. Beautiful park Beautiful place An amazing park to camp and bike ride. Extremely large beach for swimming and dogs separate from the main beach and Rondeau Bay.  Absolutely amazing place to go camping the wildlife Is stunning and it's just very beautiful  Poor campsites (extreme slopes/small sites) with no privacy - disappointing Provincial Park!  Great Park to go camping, swimming, or going for a run along the trails as it is near Chatham so you can just camp here for the weekend and drive home. Lots of biking few trails not very good canoeing unless you want to canoe in Lake Huron This is a wonderful camp with good campsites. The mosquito's can be a problem so come prepared with an screened room and bug spray. A M A Z I N G !!! Harrison trail is the best one of the park, it leads to a beautiful sandy beach and other interesting spots ... I wouldn't recommend to complete the Marsh trail passing the observation tower ... it's a bit monotonous and not rewarding at the end ... we had an exhausting but memorable time 👌🏽 Love this park Nice park. The route that walks along the point has been washed out but it still makes for a nice, fairly relaxed, stroll. 
$17 just to park your car though! Park nearby and get there by bike. Nice park with lots of trails for hiking and biking. Also there are endless sandy beaches along the Erie shoreline. There is also nice bay on the other side of the park. It is not deep and what're is flat most of the times which makes it very nice place fir vindsurfing or kiteboarding. Great place to take the family. Have a picnic, go for bike ride, boating, fishing, hiking ect. The only down fall is the cost to get in the park is too high Very nice long sandy beach perfect for sand castles, etc.  Excellent rustic camping, great facilities, reasonable price per night. Biking, hiking, paddling, family picnics, camping, education and outreach, learn about nature, plants and animals.
Knowledgeable, helpful staff.
A natural gem. This is a beautiful provincial park. They have many walking a bike paths, a nice beach, and the camping is fantastic. This is a great park for both a day trip or enjoying for an entire week. Great beach, some of the sites are good,but noise at night is seemingly ignored by rangers, would not advise to bring those who have a hard time sleeping. Some really small sites. But over all nice place. While not the Best park to party , this park is perfect for those who desire a relaxing commune with nature, especially those families who enjoy cycling. The parks roadways and trails are perfectly flat; there are no hills to be found. ... Nice park....need more attention to facilities when it is really busy Campground is very open with little privacy.  A lot of campsites for the number of showers.  Expect a wait.

My family and I pulled over a hundred off my dog and I have taken pictures of them. I really can't believe that ... Great place too visit It is nice park for camping, fishing and observing birds. But, camping site is smaller than other provincial park. Great place for a romantic walk Wonderful park with nice beach Great Park....

Beautiful hiking trails and great fishing in Rondeau Bay! Good place for relaxing Nice place A hidden gem! Great dog beach and a lot of beautiful trails.

Best part, the incredibly helpful and friendly park warden,  Carrie Beaver. Amazing hiking trails and lots of private sites. One of my favourite provincial parks - excellent staff, and well run park  Lots of well marked hiking trails The park staff are friendly. There are many security drive arounds by the care takers. The sites are serviced by 30 amp hookups. There are many drinking water outlets around the park and the washroom facilities are spotless and smell ... Good hiking trails. Nice camping spots Went to the lake, splashed around and played on the playground One of Ontario's best kept secrets   shhhhhhh...  Lots of activities for the kids.  Wonderful wheelchair sites. Very disappointed with the state of this park. It used to be very well kept when it was run by Drex and Jean-Guy. I can't believe how down hill it has gone over the years.

At Long Lake, you can paddle beside large cliffs while enjoying the serenity of motor-free environment. Lovely park Decent car camping experience. Less crowded than many other provincial parks.

Large park with all necessary amenities and a variety of activities. Always fun to hike through the dunes to find yourself a secluded beach spot for the day. Popular place so make sure you book in advance as camping spots are hard to come by! A great vacation spot for a weekend trip. The best fresh water beach that I’ve been to. Make sure to go on a non busy day. During that latter part of the summer, there is a lot of green algae floating around, watch out for that. They have some vineyards around the prince Edward county that are worth a visit as well. Since I'm from Hamilton, I'm used to Lake Ontario being disgusting, green, and toxic. When on my vacation, I came several times to Sandbanks Provincial Park, and it was honestly great! Clean water that you can actually see to the bottom ... Sandbanks is generally beautiful, and I remember it fondly from childhood.  sadly, zebra mussels have become a massive problem.  while this isn't the park's fault, it does affect the visitor experience, so I cannot give the park the rating it deserves. Clean, cheap and good for the whole family. It's nice that it hasn't been over run with Americanized stores. There's one store, with minimal selection. the bathrooms are clean. The beach is also clean and garbage free. Sand is usually ... My family has been camping at Sandbanks since long before I was born. My grandmother started taking my dads family there in the 70s and we’ve been back every year since. We always pick a week in July. Although the booking process can ...

Water gradually goes deep and sand is fine, given that it is a lake.  What I don’t like is that there is no shower room for the public to use. That facility is only available for campers and not for day use. Other ... I had a great camping trip here with my cousin. There are 5 trails to hike and tons of beach area to explore. I seen people canoeing and kayaking down the river by the outlets. The beach was spectacular and great for families. They have ... Beautiful long beach. Could be crowded during long weekend but not that bad. Great beach and water. Maybe one of the best I've been to in Ontario.  The only downfall is the price. $17 per car on the weekend we went. We visited dunes beach.  It had a nice little snack bar too and the sand is soft and clean. The water is shallow with a soft Sandy bottom and is  great for small children. Sandbanks is one of the best beaches if not the best beach on Lake Ontario.  The entrance to the park is cheap at $11/car.  The beach is wide, sandy and very shallow water makes is safe for children to wade out. The park provides picnic ... Love the park which is why I buy a seasons pass every year for 25 years. Just came back from a walk on a trail to find a ticket on my vehicle for not having a pass. PARK PASS WAS DISPLAYED IN THE VEHICLE!! Office refused to revoke the ticket or help in any way. Great public relations guys. 👎. Love this place! It gives me a pretty good impression at the gate as you get a sandbanks information guide and there are stories of family coming here for camping since 1967, now and then.  The beach is amazing. Clean and long coast ... Beach is a gem for Ontario. Large clean beach. Most of the beach is shallow and you can walk out pretty far before it starts to pass your waist. Safe for kids because of this, but there aren't any lifeguards so still keep an eye on them. Get there early to get a good spot and to avoid the lineups to get in. We enjoyed this park! The beach was nice and the park site was nice and private. Thanks for a good time. Caribbean too expensive. Too far. No worries. White sand beaches here will get you as close to a real beach experience. 

Parking limited. PLEASE, BUILD MORE & BETTER WASHROOMS.
The beach was perfect,  the sand was perfect, the water was warm the day we visited. BUT I decided to give only 3 stars because of the beach salubrity. There are no signs on the beach to direct you ... One of the best Beaches in Ontario,  great for kids and adults.  Nice silky sand.  Provincial park has nice campsites with all amenities.

My favorite beach! I travel 2.5 hours and absolutely love this beach! Crystal clear water One of the best beaches in Ontario!  Facilities are great.  Check in was slow after a long drive. Bothered me more than it should. Like anywhere, if you are picky about your campsite, be careful what you book.  We reserved late and took ... Outstanding customer service.   We were missing the grill from our fire pit.  Called the park office about it, and within an hour, they came to our site and replaced the entire fire pit.  Beaches are beautiful, and the water was so much fun.  Felt like being at the ocean. Beautiful beaches, with very warm water. Incredible to discover and enjoy summer vibes in September in Ontario. This is a must-see. A place that made me drop my jaw. The sandy beach is just beautiful. It is clean, wide and long. A great spot where you can bbq underneath your umbrella (you must have one for a hot sunny day) and jump into the water. I would have given 5 stars had the water been clean enough to swim. Very disappointed. No water at boat launch. Handicap shower in Woodlands campground not working Tuesday, staff right there notified. Not fixed, no out of order or closed sign as of Friday. Several people with mobility issues have been caught undressed before discovering there is no water! However the beaches are gorgeous. This super small lakeside village offers fine-dining, award-winning wines, and some epic music and arts events. With its own stunning beach and a boardwalk that leads to a lighthouse, there's plenty to see in this quaint artist town. It also offers the best view of the Sandbanks Dunes. Nice beach and park. Wanted to play volleyball on the beach but couldn't get anyone to play with. I guess that's not the Beach's fault but I'm still upset about it. Wow ! What a nice beach. The people seem very respectful. Very clean. I was expecting cold water and it really wasn't that cold at all. I love that park I really recommend go visit and enjoy the transparent water and warm The place is great. There is a very long line when we went there but it is worth the wait. The beach is huge and well maintained. One only thing is that it is really hot when we got there because of the heatwave. The water feels great ... This location is a must-see for anyone passing through the area. It's a lovely drive through the county in the summer, and ends with a spectacular beach that's blue as can be and an uninhibited view of sand, sun, and sky. Go with friends and make a plan to visit wine country while your at it. It's therapeutic! Love this place . We spent the whole beach day here this summer. Absolutely gorgeous and everything was convenient, easy to find and tons of fun. The beach is beautifully done the water temperature is perfect. Good place for a friends trip or for family! Small tip:  The dog areas are less crowded. Great park but small sites and over packed. Only good for beach days Well kept beach and there's a dog friendly section. I highly recommend you arriving early as it does it quite busy and they do close the parking lot when it reaches capacity. I got sand in places... Just kidding! It was a very nice place to visit.

A true gem! Best beach I have found in the province. We spent a great day here. This park is wonderful in so many ways. Beaches are speechless, and it's only at a few hours drive.

Was amazed first time I got there by how beautiful it is.

Dune Beach is crazy. An amazing time... The beach is incredible. My family and I really enjoyed our visit. Definitely worth coming back! Nice place, overcrowded in the afternoon. The camping spots could have  a little bit more privacy. The water is warm because not deep at all.  Great for a 3 days break. This is a solid park with a great beach.  The park store was ok while the nature center actually had better items for children and souvenirs.  The quality of camp site varies greatly with some private and large while others in full sun ... Going again end of August, sure hope they have repaired the access to the dogs allowed beach? Victoria Day weekend was disappointing for my wife and our dogs as the Outlet River washed out the path and the park rangers made a big deal ... It's always great.  Friendly staff and clean facilities.  Love the white Sandy Beach! Best beach I ever been in Ontario. The only downside is the parking. You have to walk to go to the beach. The beach is beautiful. But not worth going for. No shower in change room plus parking is horrible. You have to climb up the hill to go to the beach and bring your stuff from the parking lot. Not gonna come back again. Awesome a great time in the county. Sandbanks will not let you down. Water is always clean.. 3 different areas to swim, you have Sandbanks, The Outlet or the Sanddunes.. all have pros and cons, but if you want beach, sun and water.. they ... Belle plage!  Beautiful beach!  Washrooms were clean, although my wife tells me the changing rooms were not.  Got there by 9:30, still plenty of parking space.  By 11 the place was full.  Go early!!!!! BEWARE of the overzealous Park Rangers.  They will milk you for cash knowing that most people won't be able to return to Picton to attend a trial.  When you get your camping/parking pass, you should probably make multiple, enlarged ... I just love this place, Prince Edward county Ontario is one of the most beautiful places I have visited. You do not need to go to the Carribbean to enjoy the sunshine or the sandy beaches. The area is great for biking, camping, and wind surfing. Great Beach for families. Water is nice in the summer and is shallow enough for young children to wade. Very clean park and facilities. Great beach near Toronto super clean !! Ill go again We stayed for a week and the park rangers ware awesome didn’t bother anyone.
Park was nicely maintained, only downside was the boat access to the lake . Went with my good friend Bud. A little late in the season but we did see some images that I'm sure we will never forget. The best beach besides lake Ontario. Nice and cool. I am driving about 3 hours each summer to use the beach. Always a great beach to go to...can get very busy.  Water always cold because it is Lake Ontario.  Waves can be hazerdous when a storm is near. Gorgeous beach to visit. Lots of waves that are safe to swim in. Water is nice and warm on Sunny days. Hard to find parking - it can get pretty crowded. Great park. Check out the sand dunes. There is a charge to enter the park calculated per car. Great beach! Like it very much! Will definitely visit again. Do not stay in 800’s unless you want to sleep in a field. I was supper disappointed.  Nice beach but that’s about all. First time here and the last time. one of the best water i've seen. I mean you dont believe you're still in Canada and way more Ontario. I really recommend this to any 1!!!! Kids and dogs and lots of sand , fun times to be had by all ages ...
Going back next year . Hot showers was the my teenagers favourite after a swim . Keep up the great job. We have been going to Sandbanks for 20 yrs. It is beautiful. You can pick chose  the different beaches ans you must check them all out. Wonderdul staff and everyone is friendly. Affordable well kept camping spots.
The only thing to watch out for is the abundant amounts of poison ivy. So Google what it looks like to bw safe. Beautiful place for a day trip with family.    Water is fantastic!  Not much shade and the concession  stands were closed. Overall it is a great get away. Love it there, can hardly wait for summer! Beach is great but we didn't see any bathrooms close to where we were so it was a shorter stay. One of our favorite beaches to travel to as a family. It's quiet, lots of open space, and much cleaner than 90% of other hangouts that are well known. Amole parking too so that's a plus. Beach is great... but beware of a scam if u dont know their law, doesnt matter where you're from.. no visible alcohol allowed. Even tho there are no signs, nothing on their website and nothing in the entrance..you ll get a ticket..125$ Great place for the family. Soft sand and shallow enough for the kids to go into the lake Short answer is this is a must see. Beautiful beaches and very unique from my experiences. Coolest beach I've been to. Cliffs of sand pretty cool.  Didn't go far from the parking lot but definitely going again. Awesome huge beach.  Super busy with families. Go early to get a spot .  Parking right there along the road. $17 to get a pass for vehicle entry to the park . Nothing to eat nearby. 1 or 2 good trucks that's it. Most ppl take food. One of the best beaches but its better to arrive early... after 12pm line ups can be long and lot can be full. Fun , but when with little kids make sure they don't enter the water , it has random drop offs I went here yesterday with my family. I remember coming here on 3 separate occasions besides yeaterday and unlike passed years, the water has more and more seaweed in it so definitely not as clear as it was like 4 or so years ago. I ... You pay 17 bucks per car for a day pass

Go there with good weather. It was too cold for us as it also was a bit cloudy. 

Quite nice to walk around Bring a bike as each area is a considerable distance (kms) from each other. 
Different choices of spots to choose from....open grassland, wooded and beachy depending on your size (limited areas for large RVS but perfect for tent or small ... Awesome beach, amazing shallow water , clean washrooms, will come back next year for camping!! Beach was ok. Don't like the fact there is no change rooms. There are better options closer to Toronto (if that's where you're coming from. First time here but too windy today. Not sure  if it is always like this. Difficult to use paddle board. Otherwise 5 stars Wow. What a nice beach. Perfect for kids of all ages. Amazing place. Very good for families. Its clean and the beach is like the Ocean!! I camped at one of the sites near the beach which was absolutely breathtaking. The sand dunes are equally as beautiful as lake Ontario. I wouldnt recommend this park to familys with younger kids as their is a lot of poison ivy and you ... Lots of fun beautiful beach very clean except for the ones who don't know how to clean up after themselves Its only one of the best beaches in canada so if you dont like it then move to another country. The place is good for kids as long as your a decent parent and dont let the swim where it says their is undertow on the left side. Their is a lot of good beach bums their and sandbanks so dont be afraid to look around. One of our favourite places in Canada for families. Amazing beaches and beautiful scenery Love going to this beach. You'd swear that you're down south. the only thing that is missing is palm tree's.
Parking is expenisve though. Not what I remember as a child but nothing stays the same forever, still a nice clean place to take your family, no litter, clean beaches, fairly clean bathrooms, I mean it's a beach your going to have sand everywhere, parking is pretty ... Best ontario park hands down. Like a tropical paradise right in the middle of ontario! love these provincial park .. probably the best sand beach in Ontario Bit crowded, but it has great trails and some really nice lake views as well. Water is quite clear, sands are smooth and warm. The price for the parking is $17 and cannot be chosen, the rate on the ticket machine shows it can but the buttons just didn’t work. We arrived in the afternoon and had to pay the full day rate. Being going for years, my paradise in Ontario. By far one of the best provincial parks in Ontario . The beaches are amazing . Great beach, very fine and white sand! Went there end of July, water temperature was perfect! Beautiful dunes with warm water and clean beaches.  Parking was $17 but considering that it’s a provincial park and upkeep is most likely costly, sounds reasonable. Great beaches and great camping. Not much to do other than go to the beach. It is a big and nice beach with really fine sand. I wish they’d have shower. Over crowded poor traffic management. Lined up for 2 hours to eventually be told by rude park security parking is unavailable and no redirection to another area. It's also Lake Ontario so not convinced it's actually clean. Very nice but often very busy. My second fav provincial park in Ontario ! Gorgeous beaches I can’t get enough of it !! Clean beach, perfect for a family day or weekend. Little expensive for a visit of half a day but great views and beautiful. One of the best place for weekend hangout. I took this video during thunder storm. Its comparable to Florida beaches, without having to go on an airplane. Make sure to get their early, to avoid the line-up or risk of being denied entry due to parking being full.

We enter Sandbank Beach into the GPS, instead of ... Perfect Spot for time in the Sun, fun on the beach and warm water!!! We love it! Pretty beach, clean and shallow waters... Great little break from the normal life. Great beach but always crowded. Worth going at least once. One of the best beaches in Ontario.... If not the best We stayed two nights in Richardsons Campground and went to Sandbank beach and outlet beach.

The sands were good in the beach, but the water was not that clean and very crowded.

The toilet was drity and smelled bad and no showers in the ... Amazing beach.
Clear water and sand Great Beach. Clean and people generally clean up after themselves. It has sand and water. But it's nice Beautiful sunsets and the perfect place for a family get together.

Great place to take the family and friends.  👍👍 Dont miss this beach  in  summer Clean beautiful beach, one of the best in Ontario. Great local vacation spot. Can't get enough. Very cold and windy in spring, but the water is a beautiful sea green on a sunny day. The drive has water on one side of the road with many small waves,great for photos. There's a shortcut, 1min walk from lakeroad lodge road, when off season, when the main road is closed off. A must visit destination...very enjoyable and beach is wonderful Car camping is great in this park. The sand is white and soft and plentiful.  Sand bars run along the beach allowing you to walk a fair distance before entering deeper water. Great beaches and the camping is ok here. Lots of low sites so they get flooded easily. The real attraction is the day use areas and beaches. Great windsurfing and kitebpardong spot. Best beach in Ontario. Nice Beach & campground s to spend few days.

Definitely a must-go place if you like to travel not too far from Ottawa or Toronto. This year, the beach space was a bit limited due to high water levels, but the Outlet Beach was pretty much fully accessible and it was definitely not a disappointment. Tons of parking spaces as well Beautiful all Sandy beaches in Ontario.    A great place to go hiking or camp for a few days with the family. Don’t even think about going there on weekends , no matter what season it is. Sandbanks is always a great trip with the family Wow wonderfull place to be !!! very clean.  such a beautiful beach I go there twice a year. Love area and beaches Some of the nicest beaches in southern Ontario. Great beach. Perfect for families Awesome beach and place for swimming and relaxing! Always great - best swimming in ontario The quality of this beach clientele really degraded over the years. Last time I was there 95% of the visitors were obese. Driving 2+ hours from GTA, paying close to $20 for entry and seeing just fat people in swimsuits is kind of ... Love it clean and beautiful Lots of people but an amazing view. There is a lot of beach to find your own spot. Better to go early as there are always a lot of people.

We went there in middle of summer! Nice cozy warm beach just be there early to avoid traffic. Definitely a very good place to enjoy with kids. Water was muddy and dirty ..couldnt enjoy the beach but you can do canoeing/kayaking in the river near to the beach.. Sandbanks officers harassed my girlfriend shortly after our arrival.
I ended up with a false charge and have launched a complaint. It will be  a hardship to miss work and fight this in court hours from home, but it is my name. Shame on Parks Ontario. Who doesn't love white sand? It's quite lovely here :) I suggest going farther when you park because it's less crowded. There are certain spots of the beach too where you can get a bench-table; and that's great if you want to bring your own little barbecue/feast. I like Sandbanks because there are lots of trees for shade. Great area and clean. Good for young families. I am glad you pay to go in because we are paying people to keep it clean. The best thing about the county, and the Belleville area in general. Beautiful beaches sand galore Love it! Beautiful beach colour, very transparent and clean. Best place if you can't afford going south 😊 This park is always a beautiful location to visit and camp at! The campsites themselves are generally well kept. But due to it's nature of being one of the busiest provincial parks in Ontario I feel that some of the facilities (ie. Washrooms) should be updated and cared for more often. Love this place! So many people from Toronto come here. It's worth the drive They have the best beach in Ontario for sure! One of my all time favorite places. You feel like you're somewhere tropical when on the beach there. Love thewheelchair access to the beach Gorgeous scenery but very busy.  A little pricey to camp there but they do fill up quick.

Nice beach, was crowded but that was to be expected. Camped at west lake campground and it was rainy and windy and cold one night with no trees at all for protection. This was labour day long weekend. Still had a nice time besides the campsite not being the greatest, taught me to thoroughly check campsites before booking. The sands is smooth and silky. The beach is shallow near the shore, so it's safe for those who bring young children. There's also a cafe in case you didn't bring any lunch or breakfast. There are some washroom and changing station very close to the beach. World class beach. Great camping. Better make reservations 5 months in advance for camping or you probably won't be getting a site. Very nice park. Staff are very helpful and scenery is amazing Had time only for two hours on the beach
 We may come for another day but we need to come early to find a spot. Beach is above average.. But given that it's on a lake its amazing.  Don't tell anyone but it's amazing and affordable. One of our best family vacations. The beach and the park here are beautiful. There isn't a lot to do except walk around and enjoy the sights, but this place is incredibly relaxing and scenic. The parking is pricey so be prepared for that (18$). Sometimes you can stay at nearby hotel which offers a day pass to the park. What's not to love? See it for yourself. The sand dunes, trails, campsites, everything is beautiful and fun for all ages. Lovely park. Must visit at least once to see the sand dunes!

Sand dunes are a blast for the kids
Bathrooms and changing rooms by the parking area.
No shade though, so bring an umbrella, a shelter, plenty of sunscreen!
Get there early before the beaches crowd in.

They also have trails, camp ground, but I haven't checked those out. The campground itself and the beach was great. The organization however was terrible. Our campground was flooded (only found out at the gate, no notice was given) so we were offered to sleep in a field with others or get a refund and ... Beautiful beach, nice camping site I think the place really be great if everything is open and you arrive early.

It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Love Sand Banks terrible place for kids , no safety on beach, you are on your own. I felt I was in Cuba. Sandy beach for kilometres and clear water. Safe for kids since it stays shallow for long stretches.  Beautiful park, good separation between most camping sites so you don't feel like your on top of the people next to you. The park maps are horrible though and are more like directions on a napkin than a proper map. The pet beach could use some garbage cans especially if you want people to clean up pet messes. A beautiful place to visit or to camp. The besr beach ive been to so far. Very well maintained and managed. Clean washrooms and many activities to do if you stay there for multiple days The best place for the weekend camping. Unquestionably one of the finest beaches in the province.

It's about a 2.5 hour drive from Toronto, but this place is worth it (and you can easily stay overnight in the area if you want to). Lots of folks make day trips out here.

The ... What a beautiful beach especially with young children, even our 13 month old was able to crawl in the water and let the small waves hit him since it is so shallow and that way for a long ways out. There are washrooms and the beach is ... It's so nice place especially the sand beach. But some of the staff are not friendly and unprofessional. I had a parking issue and no one wants to help me. If I ever want to come back it will be for the day pass only!! Not for the camping. Beautiful beach. Wow. Dog friendly Great place for beach camping. The water and the sand are great. Awesome amenities and great for bicycles, longboards and skateboards Nice park. Sand banks are a great site to see. Camping sites are on top of each other. Good biking trail to beach. Many wineries to visit. Reasonable driving distance to Picton, Bloomfield and Belleville. Kingston and the 1000 Islands is a good day trip. Only negative is that trees cut down at campsites have been left as stumps and are a severe tripping hazard. Great for a variety of activities. Great for hiking, swimming, cycling, roller blading.... Or snoozing. Varied landscapes make for an interesting outdoor adventure.  Don't come here on the may 2-4 weekend unless you don't mind the noise from a concert at a house close by.  It's 10:05 pm, an alcohol ban in effect (which is fine) and ""no excessive noise"" signs around.  I just called about the fact that ... It is busy at times. You need to book a campsite really far in advance. Once the water level goes back to normal the beach is really nice. This year it is flooded As a child our family would come to what was then called Outlet Provincial Park and now called Sand Banks every summer for two weeks.   It was peaceful, quiet and accommodating (free firewood, trash pickup etc.)   After not going there ... Beautiful park. Great for camping, but especially the beach is awesome. I think it's one of the best beach's in Ontario. You can actually get some waves like if you were at the sea which is amazing  It’s like Caribbean in Canada Really nice beach.  Nice sand.  Just a bit busy obviously as it's a well known place. A great beach Nice camping place Love this place....go enjoy it. Awesome beaches but the park was packed and I think they could have better managed the flow of people coming, like informing the ones who won't be able to access the park (since they closed it at noon) Very good spot The beach is amazing. Soft sand and clear, shallow waters. It's hard to believe that it's Lake Ontario. You have to be there early to get on of the few picnic tables. Bring an umbrella to get some shade. The washrooms are dirty. They need to be cleaned more often.  Beautiful beach. You can walk for a really long way in the clearest, cleanest water I've ever seen!  I absolutely love this beach! I've been coming here every summer every year and it never disappoints. The sand is soft and smooth, the water is amazing, and there is also a dog friendly area that's awesome.  This provincial park is absolutely beautiful, located on some natural sand dunes on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It is an extremely popular and busy park in the summer, so don't expect too much peace and quiet. Due to the large number of people, the staff often have trouble keeping up with cleaning washrooms, etc. Good job by staff on Friday! While it was difficult for so many people to not have a campsite, they were polite and understanding throughout what looked like an extremely long day.  Too bad so much of the park was flooded by the rains. Nice to go up for the day. Great beach with enough space for everyone Going during the winter was a great experience. There were no people around and we didn't have to worry about parking either. It will be cold but definitely worth it. Great skim edit: someone must have dug the outlet river through the beach with a backhoe completely destroying any skim there was Wonderful beach,  great sand and lots of area for kids to play both in sand and along shoreline. They are also able to walk out quite a ways and it still be shallow. Trees provide shade near back of beach or you can bring umbrella or ... It's a great place for a beach vacation with families, many families Family tradition we travel all the way from Toronto We come hear a lot and I joy it every time we come
😎 Best place on the world! 🤙 Visited today, paid $17 for a day pass. Went to Dune beach only to be turned away as the parking lot was full. Drove to the other beaches and all beaches were closed due to full capacity. Drove back to the Permit Office to get a refund ... Beautifull soft sandy beaches.  Nice mix of ecosystems(beach, dune, forest, meadow, wetland) But very busy.  Can have long waits at the gate. My favourite time to go to the park is early spring primarily because no one else is there. The photos here are from may 17th 2016. From dunes to woods, kilometers of beaches and country roads to farmland the hiking and biking are ... Perfect pristine beach on the West side of the park. If you're there on the right day you can have the whole beach to yourself. Amazing atmosphere. Water is usually cold but worth it! Great for the family  My wife and I love it here. It's relaxing and safe for families. Super nice beach but too many people This is THE best beach i have been to in Ontario. (If there is a better beach, please let me know).. The beach is almost 5KM long. The water is only up to your waist more than 500 metres from the shore. The sand is clean and beautiful ... Tons of great beaches in the area. Particularly a fan of dunes beach with its gigantic sand dunes. Believe it or not, Sandbanks can be just as much fun during the winter/spring/fall months as during the summer. It's such an interesting, visually stimulating environment, definitely worth a trip. We camped for 3 nights in our 5th wheel RV. We stayed in the Westlake Campground which is set up very well. We liked that the grounds are planted with native plants and that the washroom facilities are excellent. Our site had more then ... Beautiful beach on the lake Beatiful park, especially the outlook beach (the main beach was closed due to flooding) and the bluffs they are somehow less impressive than the picture.

But the outlook beach with its white sand and emerald water colour is the closest ... Will never forget this place in my life. My wife was almost drowned in the waters. There are some sudden drop points in the water well within the marked rope area by the park officials.  So watch out ! Especially those who don't know swimming.  Otherwise good spot for a picnic with families.  In a word: Oasis. Huge white sand beach, beautiful hiking trails, ice-cream shop, you can easily live there for weeks. While staying there you can do a short trips around the island by visiting towns located near by for antique shopping as well as eating out at local restaurants: Picton and Wellington are your great choices. One of my favourite places to camp and be. Amazing beach!!! You'd never guess that it's Lake Ontario! White sandy beaches.  There are three to be exact: outlet, dunes and sandbanks.  Outlet beach is large and less busy than dunes and sandbanks.  Tip: go through highway 12 to go through the back way to the park. Very nice place! It's hard to believe you can get such great waves 🌊 on a lake! It's like the ocean!  One of the thrilling place with desert sand dunes in unusual place. Can't get enough of sandbanks Amazing sands and many fun places Great place Beautiful place to relax and enjoy shared memories One of the best beaches in Ontario. I've been going here since I was a kid, and I recommend Outlet beach for your usual beach going experience (long white sand, warm water). If you want to be a bit more adventurous try the Sandbanks Beach or the Dunes.  Beautiful national park! One of my favorite Beaches in Ontario aside from Sauble Beach. The water is shallow and safe for kids, the sand is beautiful and soft. Its a outlet beach is the best and normally gets busy during summer weekends so arrive early if you want a good spot. There change rooms and washrooms close to parking/beaches. The beach is beautiful, there is no doubt about that. My kids love to come hear and frolic in the water and build sandcastles.  We have never had a problem until this year.  DO NOT USE their outhouses.  If you have to go to the bathroom ... Very crowded in the summer but great for spring camping.  I came here with a group of friends and loved hiking the trails and climbing the sand dunes Beach was great as always! Staff at main entrance were very pleasant. We made campsite reservations. The site was very large. During our walk on the dunes trail and at the dunes beach, we noticed a lot of litter and garbage like full ... Great beach, the #1 beach in Canada in my opinion. The ""outlet beach"" is the cleanest of both. The bathroom at the second beach were horrible. This the reason why I'm giving 4 stars. During weekends there is a lineup starting around 11AM to enter the park and they sometime close it because it is full. Such a lovely place Beautiful, clean and a wonderful place to swim, or just to come relax and have a picnic. Small beach lined store fronts with a clean beach. The best beaches in Ontario, I dare say 🤣 Easily the best beach in Ontario.  Lots of local attractions to explore. Paradise in Ontario. Beautiful beach! Nicest confia  each I've ever been too Perfect summer beach. Come early as they close when they are full. Amazing beaches! Clean clear water. Great beach with clean facilities and beautiful sand. Great beach I was scammed at the Sandbanks BY SANDBANKS staff.  I paid the $16 parking permit and displayed it on the dashboard. Hours later I found a ticket for $30 for ""failure to display by parking person named W. Matthews. I called the park ... Absolutely beautiful. It feel like I'm in Cuba. The beach is amazing! Natural beauty specially the area which covers with sand dunes. Ontario lake shows itself in full force and beauty. Facilities are good and park is clean. Good for camping or a day trip. Great beach go early to avoid the parking line. Loved this beach, the sand is so soft and fun to relax in! Great place to camp and have a dip in lake Ontario, the place is often very crowed which is a bit of drawback. It is as well a great place to bring your bike. We had a great afternoon exploring the dunes. They are greedy bastards.. Its suposed to be a free provincial park. But we spent over 200 dollars.. Sux balls dont go!!! Love the place!!! We rented the Jacques cottage for a girls weekend as we have done the last couple of years the weekend after Thanksgiving but we were very disappointed. The water pressure was horrible. Barely could have a shower and the water from the ... Great park with super soft sand! Best beaches on Canadian east coast Nice beaches Enjoyes my time there and the views! Will be going back One of my favourite beaches in Canada. Amazing provincial park
Great beaches and trails Wonderful beaches and great water. This seems to be the spot where Lake Ontario is most beautiful. Entry fee to the park is $16 but it's worth the price.  Amazing natural beauty....best sunsets. It is very busy though and alot of disrespectful campers during busy times.... This place is incredible! Great place to camp. Lots of people and not too far from major cities. Nice big park and they seem to be adding lots of sites  The province should spend more money and clean the beach more often it's gotten dirty over the years Great park Beautiful park but book early if you want a spot! Well kept with excellent beaches Awesome beach great place to getaway Great beach @www move to the county.  Com Got a parking ticket for being there about 30mins. There parking dispenser only allowed me to pay 11$ for a senior pass which was the cheapest. Thought I'd take my chances as there was nobody in the park but sure enough patrol officer caught me. Nice long sandy beach with lots of sand. Great location near Kingston, ON  Amazing camping views....giant park but nice wide sites and a beach just like N.C obx Car camping at its best. Ideal for families with young children. Spending the day at Sandbanks is one of my most cherished memories. So much family fun with each visit. Love to body surf the waves Best camping place with sandy Shores ever seen Looks like the ocean Beautiful sand beach not crazy busy  Nice scenery, overcrowded and overpriced Great camping,very nice beach. If you love soft Sandy beaches, this is the provincial Park for you. Busy, but arguably the best beach in Ontario. Been here many times ...it never disapoints for sunsets Very nice park, enjoyed our vacation although beaches were closed for swimming for the first few days. Beautiful white sand I went with my family wife, son (11) and my daughter (9), and we loved, the camp side, the main washrooms was pretty and clean, the washrooms close to the camp site was not so clean, but was good, the water and the sand was very good. ... Prettiest beach I've seen Nice place but the toilet situation was disgusting for the price. Dead fish on the beach too and nobody seemed to concerned about picking them up and getting rid of the smell. Beautiful place though. Too bad they dont take care of it. Great location, beaches have very soft sand. Lots of areas to walk and bike. Not enough shower or toilet facilities though. Awesome sand beaches.  Not too crowded and easy parking.  Each car is $17/day. We had a wonderful experience during our stay at Sandbanks. The hiking trails, beach and camping were very memorable. Long sandy beaches.  A great way to spend the day. Really nice beach! Oh but mind the centipedes, during the summer they literally infest the sand climbing up the slope to get into the beach. Fantastic Long line to get in to the beach. Crowded but not too bad.  Amazing beach!  Washrooms aren't always the cleanest and it is very crowded in the summer.  The best time to go is September after the labour day long weekend.   Great beach, but not the cleanest PP we visited with our RV. We found the facilities for camper a bit lacking and overall very busy and crowded. The beach makes up for a lot but that is about it. We stayed at other PP's with our RV on this trip and found them what roomier and cleaner. Love it Service at desk sucks big time... Awesome Nice beach It was a very great experience. The beach is so clean and the water is so clear . Overall we had a very nice weekend. Very pretty with nice beaches! Great dunes... but busy Great beaches and places for picnics. Provincial park people why do you insist on charging same day price for people that arrive early morning and those of us that like to arrive after mid-afternoon and maybe only stay an hour? Been going to sandbanks since I was 10 days old amazing experience get an electrical site  Beautiful Great place to hang out with the kids Very nice park, beautiful views Such a beautiful beach Everything you thought it was, endless white sand beaches, clear warm water Love the animal friendly area! Great park with multiple beaches and other areas to enjoy. I come here every year for a week and it is the best place to camp as well as going to the different beaches!   Love sandbanks! I go there all the time, its beautiful all year. Nice place to visit Beautiful Busy and too crowded to enjoy. If you don't mind crowded areas and next to impossible parking...

Super beau","World’s largest baymouth barrier dune formation
Three expansive sandy beaches that some say are among the best in Canada; Outlet Beach is perfect for families, with shallow waters and gentle drop off
Location jutting out into Lake Ontario means that this park is a bird migration hotspot in spring and fall
Walking trails that allow visitors to experience the dune and wetland habitats of the park
Daily interpretive programming for the whole family during summer months
Great starting point to explore Prince Edward County known for its bicycle touring, wineries, food and antiquesMy favourite provincial park! Large park with all necessary amenities and a variety of activities. Always fun to hike through the dunes to find yourself a secluded beach spot for the day. Popular place so make sure you book in advance as camping spots are hard to come by! A great vacation spot for a weekend trip. The best fresh water beach that I’ve been to. Make sure to go on a non busy day. During that latter part of the summer, there is a lot of green algae floating around, watch out for that. They have some vineyards around the prince Edward county that are worth a visit as well. Since I'm from Hamilton, I'm used to Lake Ontario being disgusting, green, and toxic. When on my vacation, I came several times to Sandbanks Provincial Park, and it was honestly great! Clean water that you can actually see to the bottom ... Sandbanks is generally beautiful, and I remember it fondly from childhood.  sadly, zebra mussels have become a massive problem.  while this isn't the park's fault, it does affect the visitor experience, so I cannot give the park the rating it deserves. Clean, cheap and good for the whole family. It's nice that it hasn't been over run with Americanized stores. There's one store, with minimal selection. the bathrooms are clean. The beach is also clean and garbage free. Sand is usually ... My family has been camping at Sandbanks since long before I was born. My grandmother started taking my dads family there in the 70s and we’ve been back every year since. We always pick a week in July. Although the booking process can ... If you have young kids you really cannot beat Sandbanks Provincial Park given its massive beaches with shallow water that are absolutely perfect to allow your children to roam around. You won't have to freak out about whether the water ... This review is long overdue. Had a great time here. If you don't like crowd areas, this is a great place to visit. I like the beach here. Water gradually goes deep and sand is fine, given that it is a lake.  What I don’t like is that there is no shower room for the public to use. That facility is only available for campers and not for day use. Other ... I had a great camping trip here with my cousin. There are 5 trails to hike and tons of beach area to explore. I seen people canoeing and kayaking down the river by the outlets. The beach was spectacular and great for families. They have ... Beautiful long beach. Could be crowded during long weekend but not that bad. Great beach and water. Maybe one of the best I've been to in Ontario.  The only downfall is the price. $17 per car on the weekend we went. We visited dunes beach.  It had a nice little snack bar too and the sand is soft and clean. The water is shallow with a soft Sandy bottom and is  great for small children. Sandbanks is one of the best beaches if not the best beach on Lake Ontario.  The entrance to the park is cheap at $11/car.  The beach is wide, sandy and very shallow water makes is safe for children to wade out. The park provides picnic ... Love the park which is why I buy a seasons pass every year for 25 years. Just came back from a walk on a trail to find a ticket on my vehicle for not having a pass. PARK PASS WAS DISPLAYED IN THE VEHICLE!! Office refused to revoke the ticket or help in any way. Great public relations guys. 👎. Love this place! It gives me a pretty good impression at the gate as you get a sandbanks information guide and there are stories of family coming here for camping since 1967, now and then.  The beach is amazing. Clean and long coast ... Beach is a gem for Ontario. Large clean beach. Most of the beach is shallow and you can walk out pretty far before it starts to pass your waist. Safe for kids because of this, but there aren't any lifeguards so still keep an eye on them. Get there early to get a good spot and to avoid the lineups to get in. We enjoyed this park! The beach was nice and the park site was nice and private. Thanks for a good time. Caribbean too expensive. Too far. No worries. White sand beaches here will get you as close to a real beach experience. 

Parking limited. PLEASE, BUILD MORE & BETTER WASHROOMS.
The beach was perfect,  the sand was perfect, the water was warm the day we visited. BUT I decided to give only 3 stars because of the beach salubrity. There are no signs on the beach to direct you ... One of the best Beaches in Ontario,  great for kids and adults.  Nice silky sand.  Provincial park has nice campsites with all amenities.  Lots to do around there: horseback riding/fishing/hiking/boating/ Pictor close by for some ... Went here for the first time last weekend and was amazed! The beautiful sandy beaches looked like something from a vacation brochure not our Lake Ontario! The kids had a blast walking out on the sandbags that seemed to go forever. The ... The inner canadian ocean! Ontario has a marvel that needs to be discovered! Sandbanks just like the name. You can sit on the beach and relax while the kids are out in the water playing. The water is warm and is so shallow that you can ... Greatest provincial park in Ontario.  Between the immaculate sandy beaches and the clean bathroom/showers it's really the best place to camp or just visit for a day trip.  The dunes are great for the kids, dune jumping is great and the ... A beautiful beach which waters are warm and clear. It’s a great location to pretend being lost at sea, because you can seemingly goes miles off shore and still being able to touch the bottom. ( from perspective of someone 6ft and up) but ... My favorite beach! I travel 2.5 hours and absolutely love this beach! Crystal clear water One of the best beaches in Ontario!  Facilities are great.  Check in was slow after a long drive. Bothered me more than it should. Like anywhere, if you are picky about your campsite, be careful what you book.  We reserved late and took ... Outstanding customer service.   We were missing the grill from our fire pit.  Called the park office about it, and within an hour, they came to our site and replaced the entire fire pit.  Beaches are beautiful, and the water was so much fun.  Felt like being at the ocean. Beautiful beaches, with very warm water. Incredible to discover and enjoy summer vibes in September in Ontario. This is a must-see. A place that made me drop my jaw. The sandy beach is just beautiful. It is clean, wide and long. A great spot where you can bbq underneath your umbrella (you must have one for a hot sunny day) and jump into the water. I would have given 5 stars had the water been clean enough to swim. Very disappointed. No water at boat launch. Handicap shower in Woodlands campground not working Tuesday, staff right there notified. Not fixed, no out of order or closed sign as of Friday. Several people with mobility issues have been caught undressed before discovering there is no water! However the beaches are gorgeous. This super small lakeside village offers fine-dining, award-winning wines, and some epic music and arts events. With its own stunning beach and a boardwalk that leads to a lighthouse, there's plenty to see in this quaint artist town. It also offers the best view of the Sandbanks Dunes. Nice beach and park. Wanted to play volleyball on the beach but couldn't get anyone to play with. I guess that's not the Beach's fault but I'm still upset about it. Wow ! What a nice beach. The people seem very respectful. Very clean. I was expecting cold water and it really wasn't that cold at all. I love that park I really recommend go visit and enjoy the transparent water and warm The place is great. There is a very long line when we went there but it is worth the wait. The beach is huge and well maintained. One only thing is that it is really hot when we got there because of the heatwave. The water feels great ... This location is a must-see for anyone passing through the area. It's a lovely drive through the county in the summer, and ends with a spectacular beach that's blue as can be and an uninhibited view of sand, sun, and sky. Go with friends and make a plan to visit wine country while your at it. It's therapeutic! Love this place . We spent the whole beach day here this summer. Absolutely gorgeous and everything was convenient, easy to find and tons of fun. The beach is beautifully done the water temperature is perfect. Good place for a friends trip or for family! Small tip:  The dog areas are less crowded. Great park but small sites and over packed. Only good for beach days Well kept beach and there's a dog friendly section. I highly recommend you arriving early as it does it quite busy and they do close the parking lot when it reaches capacity. I got sand in places... Just kidding! It was a very nice place to visit. The beach is amazzzzing!!! Beautiful blue water, white fine sand and lots of room. You don't feel crowded!! The water is clear and on the windy days theirs waves! So much fun! The water is not deep before a few 50-100 feet away, perfect ... Probably the best provincial park in Ontario with fabulous sandy beaches. 😍 Love it. Great for families. Great for young kids. In summer go early sometimes park fills up & closes it's gates!!!! Dunes Day Beach, smallish, but it has ... Love this beach!   Nice and clean and warm.  Have been coming for over 30 years! A true gem! Best beach I have found in the province. We spent a great day here. This park is wonderful in so many ways. Beaches are speechless, and it's only at a few hours drive.

Was amazed first time I got there by how beautiful it is.

Dune Beach is crazy. An amazing time... The beach is incredible. My family and I really enjoyed our visit. Definitely worth coming back! Nice place, overcrowded in the afternoon. The camping spots could have  a little bit more privacy. The water is warm because not deep at all.  Great for a 3 days break. This is a solid park with a great beach.  The park store was ok while the nature center actually had better items for children and souvenirs.  The quality of camp site varies greatly with some private and large while others in full sun ... Going again end of August, sure hope they have repaired the access to the dogs allowed beach? Victoria Day weekend was disappointing for my wife and our dogs as the Outlet River washed out the path and the park rangers made a big deal ... It's always great.  Friendly staff and clean facilities.  Love the white Sandy Beach! Best beach I ever been in Ontario. The only downside is the parking. You have to walk to go to the beach. The beach is beautiful. But not worth going for. No shower in change room plus parking is horrible. You have to climb up the hill to go to the beach and bring your stuff from the parking lot. Not gonna come back again. Awesome a great time in the county. Sandbanks will not let you down. Water is always clean.. 3 different areas to swim, you have Sandbanks, The Outlet or the Sanddunes.. all have pros and cons, but if you want beach, sun and water.. they ... Belle plage!  Beautiful beach!  Washrooms were clean, although my wife tells me the changing rooms were not.  Got there by 9:30, still plenty of parking space.  By 11 the place was full.  Go early!!!!! BEWARE of the overzealous Park Rangers.  They will milk you for cash knowing that most people won't be able to return to Picton to attend a trial.  When you get your camping/parking pass, you should probably make multiple, enlarged ... I just love this place, Prince Edward county Ontario is one of the most beautiful places I have visited. You do not need to go to the Carribbean to enjoy the sunshine or the sandy beaches. The area is great for biking, camping, and wind surfing. Great Beach for families. Water is nice in the summer and is shallow enough for young children to wade. Very clean park and facilities. Great beach near Toronto super clean !! Ill go again We stayed for a week and the park rangers ware awesome didn’t bother anyone.
Park was nicely maintained, only downside was the boat access to the lake . Went with my good friend Bud. A little late in the season but we did see some images that I'm sure we will never forget. The best beach besides lake Ontario. Nice and cool. I am driving about 3 hours each summer to use the beach. Always a great beach to go to...can get very busy.  Water always cold because it is Lake Ontario.  Waves can be hazerdous when a storm is near. Gorgeous beach to visit. Lots of waves that are safe to swim in. Water is nice and warm on Sunny days. Hard to find parking - it can get pretty crowded. Great park. Check out the sand dunes. There is a charge to enter the park calculated per car. Great beach! Like it very much! Will definitely visit again. Do not stay in 800’s unless you want to sleep in a field. I was supper disappointed.  Nice beach but that’s about all. First time here and the last time. one of the best water i've seen. I mean you dont believe you're still in Canada and way more Ontario. I really recommend this to any 1!!!! Kids and dogs and lots of sand , fun times to be had by all ages ...
Going back next year . Hot showers was the my teenagers favourite after a swim . Keep up the great job. We have been going to Sandbanks for 20 yrs. It is beautiful. You can pick chose  the different beaches ans you must check them all out. Wonderdul staff and everyone is friendly. Affordable well kept camping spots.
The only thing to watch out for is the abundant amounts of poison ivy. So Google what it looks like to bw safe. Beautiful place for a day trip with family.    Water is fantastic!  Not much shade and the concession  stands were closed. Overall it is a great get away. Love it there, can hardly wait for summer! Beach is great but we didn't see any bathrooms close to where we were so it was a shorter stay. One of our favorite beaches to travel to as a family. It's quiet, lots of open space, and much cleaner than 90% of other hangouts that are well known. Amole parking too so that's a plus. Beach is great... but beware of a scam if u dont know their law, doesnt matter where you're from.. no visible alcohol allowed. Even tho there are no signs, nothing on their website and nothing in the entrance..you ll get a ticket..125$ Great place for the family. Soft sand and shallow enough for the kids to go into the lake Short answer is this is a must see. Beautiful beaches and very unique from my experiences. Coolest beach I've been to. Cliffs of sand pretty cool.  Didn't go far from the parking lot but definitely going again. Awesome huge beach.  Super busy with families. Go early to get a spot .  Parking right there along the road. $17 to get a pass for vehicle entry to the park . Nothing to eat nearby. 1 or 2 good trucks that's it. Most ppl take food. One of the best beaches but its better to arrive early... after 12pm line ups can be long and lot can be full. Fun , but when with little kids make sure they don't enter the water , it has random drop offs I went here yesterday with my family. I remember coming here on 3 separate occasions besides yeaterday and unlike passed years, the water has more and more seaweed in it so definitely not as clear as it was like 4 or so years ago. I ... You pay 17 bucks per car for a day pass

Go there with good weather. It was too cold for us as it also was a bit cloudy. 

Quite nice to walk around Bring a bike as each area is a considerable distance (kms) from each other. 
Different choices of spots to choose from....open grassland, wooded and beachy depending on your size (limited areas for large RVS but perfect for tent or small ... Awesome beach, amazing shallow water , clean washrooms, will come back next year for camping!! Beach was ok. Don't like the fact there is no change rooms. There are better options closer to Toronto (if that's where you're coming from. First time here but too windy today. Not sure  if it is always like this. Difficult to use paddle board. Otherwise 5 stars Wow. What a nice beach. Perfect for kids of all ages. Amazing place. Very good for families. Its clean and the beach is like the Ocean!! I camped at one of the sites near the beach which was absolutely breathtaking. The sand dunes are equally as beautiful as lake Ontario. I wouldnt recommend this park to familys with younger kids as their is a lot of poison ivy and you ... Lots of fun beautiful beach very clean except for the ones who don't know how to clean up after themselves Its only one of the best beaches in canada so if you dont like it then move to another country. The place is good for kids as long as your a decent parent and dont let the swim where it says their is undertow on the left side. Their is a lot of good beach bums their and sandbanks so dont be afraid to look around. One of our favourite places in Canada for families. Amazing beaches and beautiful scenery Love going to this beach. You'd swear that you're down south. the only thing that is missing is palm tree's.
Parking is expenisve though. Not what I remember as a child but nothing stays the same forever, still a nice clean place to take your family, no litter, clean beaches, fairly clean bathrooms, I mean it's a beach your going to have sand everywhere, parking is pretty ... Best ontario park hands down. Like a tropical paradise right in the middle of ontario! love these provincial park .. probably the best sand beach in Ontario Bit crowded, but it has great trails and some really nice lake views as well. Water is quite clear, sands are smooth and warm. The price for the parking is $17 and cannot be chosen, the rate on the ticket machine shows it can but the buttons just didn’t work. We arrived in the afternoon and had to pay the full day rate. Being going for years, my paradise in Ontario. By far one of the best provincial parks in Ontario . The beaches are amazing . Great beach, very fine and white sand! Went there end of July, water temperature was perfect! Beautiful dunes with warm water and clean beaches.  Parking was $17 but considering that it’s a provincial park and upkeep is most likely costly, sounds reasonable. Great beaches and great camping. Not much to do other than go to the beach. It is a big and nice beach with really fine sand. I wish they’d have shower. Over crowded poor traffic management. Lined up for 2 hours to eventually be told by rude park security parking is unavailable and no redirection to another area. It's also Lake Ontario so not convinced it's actually clean. Very nice but often very busy. My second fav provincial park in Ontario ! Gorgeous beaches I can’t get enough of it !! Clean beach, perfect for a family day or weekend. Little expensive for a visit of half a day but great views and beautiful. One of the best place for weekend hangout. I took this video during thunder storm. Its comparable to Florida beaches, without having to go on an airplane. Make sure to get their early, to avoid the line-up or risk of being denied entry due to parking being full.

We enter Sandbank Beach into the GPS, instead of ... Perfect Spot for time in the Sun, fun on the beach and warm water!!! We love it! Pretty beach, clean and shallow waters... Great little break from the normal life. Great beach but always crowded. Worth going at least once. One of the best beaches in Ontario.... If not the best We stayed two nights in Richardsons Campground and went to Sandbank beach and outlet beach.

The sands were good in the beach, but the water was not that clean and very crowded.

The toilet was drity and smelled bad and no showers in the ... Amazing beach.
Clear water and sand Great Beach. Clean and people generally clean up after themselves. It has sand and water. But it's nice Beautiful sunsets and the perfect place for a family get together. Amazing beach and great soft sand. If you go on a sunny day then parking is going to be problematic Beautiful beach! Went to both Outlet beach and the dunes. Great place to take the family and friends.  👍👍 Dont miss this beach  in  summer Clean beautiful beach, one of the best in Ontario. Great local vacation spot. Can't get enough. Very cold and windy in spring, but the water is a beautiful sea green on a sunny day. The drive has water on one side of the road with many small waves,great for photos. There's a shortcut, 1min walk from lakeroad lodge road, when off season, when the main road is closed off. A must visit destination...very enjoyable and beach is wonderful Car camping is great in this park. The sand is white and soft and plentiful.  Sand bars run along the beach allowing you to walk a fair distance before entering deeper water. Great beaches and the camping is ok here. Lots of low sites so they get flooded easily. The real attraction is the day use areas and beaches. Great windsurfing and kitebpardong spot. Best beach in Ontario. Nice Beach & campground s to spend few days. Love it! feels like I'm at the beach Bathrooms near each campsite & showers. Firewood for sale at entrance also near by out of camp grounds at local store & road side stands. Gorgeous beaches near by with very fine grain sand. Also there's a animal allowed beach as well as non allowed ones Lots of pretty girls in the summer. Best park nearby toronto Good large park. 17 bucks but world class beach Hot hot great place to take the kids or grandkids Nice place very beautiful it's a long that's worth it Absolutely love this provincial park.  The beach is great, kids have a good time Good spot for camping very clean grounds and nice beach Water feels wonderful absolutely amazing hang out place for the family Nice park with a beach. we go there every year. Definitely a must-go place if you like to travel not too far from Ottawa or Toronto. This year, the beach space was a bit limited due to high water levels, but the Outlet Beach was pretty much fully accessible and it was definitely not a disappointment. Tons of parking spaces as well Beautiful all Sandy beaches in Ontario.    A great place to go hiking or camp for a few days with the family. Don’t even think about going there on weekends , no matter what season it is. Sandbanks is always a great trip with the family Wow wonderfull place to be !!! very clean.  such a beautiful beach I go there twice a year. Love area and beaches Some of the nicest beaches in southern Ontario. Great beach. Perfect for families Awesome beach and place for swimming and relaxing! Always great - best swimming in ontario The quality of this beach clientele really degraded over the years. Last time I was there 95% of the visitors were obese. Driving 2+ hours from GTA, paying close to $20 for entry and seeing just fat people in swimsuits is kind of ... Love it clean and beautiful Lots of people but an amazing view. There is a lot of beach to find your own spot. Better to go early as there are always a lot of people. OMG it's like you are somewhere at the beach, it's amazing place to be and make holidays alone or with partner or with family, it's very family friendly you definitely should visit this place even when season is over you dont be disappointed. Amazing place, amazing view have fun there😉 One the busiest provincial parks in Ontario. This park is always packed but there is plenty of room on the beach for everyone! Gorgeous location! Sandy sandy sandy and far away from my place... Get there early or it hard to find a parking spot for a day trippers Closest thing to feeling like we are vacationing by the ocean. Family favourite. We went there in middle of summer! Nice cozy warm beach just be there early to avoid traffic. Definitely a very good place to enjoy with kids. Water was muddy and dirty ..couldnt enjoy the beach but you can do canoeing/kayaking in the river near to the beach.. Sandbanks officers harassed my girlfriend shortly after our arrival.
I ended up with a false charge and have launched a complaint. It will be  a hardship to miss work and fight this in court hours from home, but it is my name. Shame on Parks Ontario. Who doesn't love white sand? It's quite lovely here :) I suggest going farther when you park because it's less crowded. There are certain spots of the beach too where you can get a bench-table; and that's great if you want to bring your own little barbecue/feast. I like Sandbanks because there are lots of trees for shade. Great area and clean. Good for young families. I am glad you pay to go in because we are paying people to keep it clean. The best thing about the county, and the Belleville area in general. Beautiful beaches sand galore Love it! Beautiful beach colour, very transparent and clean. Best place if you can't afford going south 😊 This park is always a beautiful location to visit and camp at! The campsites themselves are generally well kept. But due to it's nature of being one of the busiest provincial parks in Ontario I feel that some of the facilities (ie. Washrooms) should be updated and cared for more often. Love this place! So many people from Toronto come here. It's worth the drive They have the best beach in Ontario for sure! One of my all time favorite places. You feel like you're somewhere tropical when on the beach there. Love thewheelchair access to the beach Gorgeous scenery but very busy.  A little pricey to camp there but they do fill up quick.  Make sure to reserve in advance. Went there to visit family for 2 hours .
Paid 18 dollars and told to park outside the gate in a special place .
I had a handicap parking permit on my car and had food to carry in a long hike to a spot that was awefull. My leg was in a ... Outlet beach is packed all summer long, so families will dig it. Probably the most developed provincial park so flush toilets and amenities are everywhere. If you're a couple or a gang who wants more privacy the sandbanks beach is a good ... Amazing sands and waves. Pretty full beach. Got a parking ticket for not displaying the pass when it was clearly visible as being turned the right side up on the rear view mirror. Not cool. Otherwise had a fun time with my husband. Very scenic.  This is a beautiful park, very well maintained. The beach is gorgeous and there are some great short trails to go around. Perfect for a day trip. Ver nice place to camping. All amenities. You need to reserve in advance. I love the beach. Great beach to go. Quiet clean close to beach campground. The place is amazing for a family with trailer parking and cottage rearking you can ride your bike and there are public showers  after the beach the beach is very nice with a great veiw at sunset. Nice beach, was crowded but that was to be expected. Camped at west lake campground and it was rainy and windy and cold one night with no trees at all for protection. This was labour day long weekend. Still had a nice time besides the campsite not being the greatest, taught me to thoroughly check campsites before booking. The sands is smooth and silky. The beach is shallow near the shore, so it's safe for those who bring young children. There's also a cafe in case you didn't bring any lunch or breakfast. There are some washroom and changing station very close to the beach. World class beach. Great camping. Better make reservations 5 months in advance for camping or you probably won't be getting a site. Very nice park. Staff are very helpful and scenery is amazing Had time only for two hours on the beach
 We may come for another day but we need to come early to find a spot. Beach is above average.. But given that it's on a lake its amazing.  Don't tell anyone but it's amazing and affordable. One of our best family vacations. The beach and the park here are beautiful. There isn't a lot to do except walk around and enjoy the sights, but this place is incredibly relaxing and scenic. The parking is pricey so be prepared for that (18$). Sometimes you can stay at nearby hotel which offers a day pass to the park. What's not to love? See it for yourself. The sand dunes, trails, campsites, everything is beautiful and fun for all ages. Lovely park. Must visit at least once to see the sand dunes! Kayaking and canoeing rental available on park, which is great. I also saw a Western Black Rat Snake here by the portion of Lake Ontario near the Woodlands campground! World's wonder Very beautiful scenery however it is often busy with lots of people which takes away from the enjoyment. Love it here. One of the best provincial camps in Ontario. There is alot of Sand dunes all around. The water is shallow for quite some time so you can walk very far out. 

This time around we had some loud neighbors. We told the park ... Clean beach and water is super clear definately recommend! The goto beach spot for eastern Ontario. Very Beautiful, will definitely go back Beautiful and peaceful beaches. Interesting place. Beautiful. Will be back This beach is amazing! The $18 for parking is a little high so try to fit everyone and everything into 1 car! It is a little difficult to get around if you haven't been there before so download a map before hand to be able to visit the ... Great beach.
Sand dunes are a blast for the kids
Bathrooms and changing rooms by the parking area.
No shade though, so bring an umbrella, a shelter, plenty of sunscreen!
Get there early before the beaches crowd in.

They also have trails, camp ground, but I haven't checked those out. The campground itself and the beach was great. The organization however was terrible. Our campground was flooded (only found out at the gate, no notice was given) so we were offered to sleep in a field with others or get a refund and ... Beautiful beach, nice camping site I think the place really be great if everything is open and you arrive early. On the other hand, there is really a lack in flexibility with the way parking/entrance work. Indeed, it's very disappointed to pay a full day price when you ... Amazing beachc Beautiful area Clean site. Clean bathrooms. Clean beach. One of the better beaches in Ontario The sand is really fine and smooth. The beach is gorgeous. Highly recommend visiting. no  shower   no sink to watch your hands       way  too sandy Awesome family location! Get there early to get parking Great place for a family outing Very nice and clean Wow what. Cool place to go for the day Had a wonderful time. Camped with 2 small children, 4 adults and our dog. We stayed at the woodland camp site on a shaded site close to the comfort station for 4 nights, 5 days and wished we booked at week because their is so much to do ... I don't like Sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Love Sand Banks terrible place for kids , no safety on beach, you are on your own. I felt I was in Cuba. Sandy beach for kilometres and clear water. Safe for kids since it stays shallow for long stretches.  Beautiful park, good separation between most camping sites so you don't feel like your on top of the people next to you. The park maps are horrible though and are more like directions on a napkin than a proper map. The pet beach could use some garbage cans especially if you want people to clean up pet messes. A beautiful place to visit or to camp. The besr beach ive been to so far. Very well maintained and managed. Clean washrooms and many activities to do if you stay there for multiple days The best place for the weekend camping. Unquestionably one of the finest beaches in the province.

It's about a 2.5 hour drive from Toronto, but this place is worth it (and you can easily stay overnight in the area if you want to). Lots of folks make day trips out here.

The ... What a beautiful beach especially with young children, even our 13 month old was able to crawl in the water and let the small waves hit him since it is so shallow and that way for a long ways out. There are washrooms and the beach is ... It's so nice place especially the sand beach. But some of the staff are not friendly and unprofessional. I had a parking issue and no one wants to help me. If I ever want to come back it will be for the day pass only!! Not for the camping. Beautiful beach. Wow. Dog friendly Great place for beach camping. The water and the sand are great. Awesome amenities and great for bicycles, longboards and skateboards Nice park. Sand banks are a great site to see. Camping sites are on top of each other. Good biking trail to beach. Many wineries to visit. Reasonable driving distance to Picton, Bloomfield and Belleville. Kingston and the 1000 Islands is a good day trip. Only negative is that trees cut down at campsites have been left as stumps and are a severe tripping hazard. Great for a variety of activities. Great for hiking, swimming, cycling, roller blading.... Or snoozing. Varied landscapes make for an interesting outdoor adventure.  Don't come here on the may 2-4 weekend unless you don't mind the noise from a concert at a house close by.  It's 10:05 pm, an alcohol ban in effect (which is fine) and ""no excessive noise"" signs around.  I just called about the fact that ... It is busy at times. You need to book a campsite really far in advance. Once the water level goes back to normal the beach is really nice. This year it is flooded As a child our family would come to what was then called Outlet Provincial Park and now called Sand Banks every summer for two weeks.   It was peaceful, quiet and accommodating (free firewood, trash pickup etc.)   After not going there ... Beautiful park. Great for camping, but especially the beach is awesome. I think it's one of the best beach's in Ontario. You can actually get some waves like if you were at the sea which is amazing  It’s like Caribbean in Canada Really nice beach.  Nice sand.  Just a bit busy obviously as it's a well known place. A great beach Nice camping place Love this place....go enjoy it. Awesome beaches but the park was packed and I think they could have better managed the flow of people coming, like informing the ones who won't be able to access the park (since they closed it at noon) Very good spot The beach is amazing. Soft sand and clear, shallow waters. It's hard to believe that it's Lake Ontario. You have to be there early to get on of the few picnic tables. Bring an umbrella to get some shade. The washrooms are dirty. They need to be cleaned more often.  Beautiful beach. You can walk for a really long way in the clearest, cleanest water I've ever seen!  I absolutely love this beach! I've been coming here every summer every year and it never disappoints. The sand is soft and smooth, the water is amazing, and there is also a dog friendly area that's awesome.  This provincial park is absolutely beautiful, located on some natural sand dunes on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It is an extremely popular and busy park in the summer, so don't expect too much peace and quiet. Due to the large number of people, the staff often have trouble keeping up with cleaning washrooms, etc. Good job by staff on Friday! While it was difficult for so many people to not have a campsite, they were polite and understanding throughout what looked like an extremely long day.  Too bad so much of the park was flooded by the rains. Nice to go up for the day. Great beach with enough space for everyone Going during the winter was a great experience. There were no people around and we didn't have to worry about parking either. It will be cold but definitely worth it. Great skim edit: someone must have dug the outlet river through the beach with a backhoe completely destroying any skim there was Wonderful beach,  great sand and lots of area for kids to play both in sand and along shoreline. They are also able to walk out quite a ways and it still be shallow. Trees provide shade near back of beach or you can bring umbrella or ... It's a great place for a beach vacation with families, many families Family tradition we travel all the way from Toronto We come hear a lot and I joy it every time we come
😎 Best place on the world! 🤙 Visited today, paid $17 for a day pass. Went to Dune beach only to be turned away as the parking lot was full. Drove to the other beaches and all beaches were closed due to full capacity. Drove back to the Permit Office to get a refund ... Beautifull soft sandy beaches.  Nice mix of ecosystems(beach, dune, forest, meadow, wetland) But very busy.  Can have long waits at the gate. My favourite time to go to the park is early spring primarily because no one else is there. The photos here are from may 17th 2016. From dunes to woods, kilometers of beaches and country roads to farmland the hiking and biking are ... Perfect pristine beach on the West side of the park. If you're there on the right day you can have the whole beach to yourself. Amazing atmosphere. Water is usually cold but worth it! Great for the family  My wife and I love it here. It's relaxing and safe for families. Super nice beach but too many people This is THE best beach i have been to in Ontario. (If there is a better beach, please let me know).. The beach is almost 5KM long. The water is only up to your waist more than 500 metres from the shore. The sand is clean and beautiful ... Tons of great beaches in the area. Particularly a fan of dunes beach with its gigantic sand dunes. Believe it or not, Sandbanks can be just as much fun during the winter/spring/fall months as during the summer. It's such an interesting, visually stimulating environment, definitely worth a trip. We camped for 3 nights in our 5th wheel RV. We stayed in the Westlake Campground which is set up very well. We liked that the grounds are planted with native plants and that the washroom facilities are excellent. Our site had more then ... Beautiful beach on the lake Beatiful park, especially the outlook beach (the main beach was closed due to flooding) and the bluffs they are somehow less impressive than the picture.

But the outlook beach with its white sand and emerald water colour is the closest ... Will never forget this place in my life. My wife was almost drowned in the waters. There are some sudden drop points in the water well within the marked rope area by the park officials.  So watch out ! Especially those who don't know swimming.  Otherwise good spot for a picnic with families.  In a word: Oasis. Huge white sand beach, beautiful hiking trails, ice-cream shop, you can easily live there for weeks. While staying there you can do a short trips around the island by visiting towns located near by for antique shopping as well as eating out at local restaurants: Picton and Wellington are your great choices. One of my favourite places to camp and be. Amazing beach!!! You'd never guess that it's Lake Ontario! White sandy beaches.  There are three to be exact: outlet, dunes and sandbanks.  Outlet beach is large and less busy than dunes and sandbanks.  Tip: go through highway 12 to go through the back way to the park. Very nice place! It's hard to believe you can get such great waves 🌊 on a lake! It's like the ocean!  One of the thrilling place with desert sand dunes in unusual place. Can't get enough of sandbanks Amazing sands and many fun places Great place Beautiful place to relax and enjoy shared memories One of the best beaches in Ontario. I've been going here since I was a kid, and I recommend Outlet beach for your usual beach going experience (long white sand, warm water). If you want to be a bit more adventurous try the Sandbanks Beach or the Dunes.  Beautiful national park! One of my favorite Beaches in Ontario aside from Sauble Beach. The water is shallow and safe for kids, the sand is beautiful and soft. Its a outlet beach is the best and normally gets busy during summer weekends so arrive early if you want a good spot. There change rooms and washrooms close to parking/beaches. The beach is beautiful, there is no doubt about that. My kids love to come hear and frolic in the water and build sandcastles.  We have never had a problem until this year.  DO NOT USE their outhouses.  If you have to go to the bathroom ... Very crowded in the summer but great for spring camping.  I came here with a group of friends and loved hiking the trails and climbing the sand dunes Beach was great as always! Staff at main entrance were very pleasant. We made campsite reservations. The site was very large. During our walk on the dunes trail and at the dunes beach, we noticed a lot of litter and garbage like full ... Great beach, the #1 beach in Canada in my opinion. The ""outlet beach"" is the cleanest of both. The bathroom at the second beach were horrible. This the reason why I'm giving 4 stars. During weekends there is a lineup starting around 11AM to enter the park and they sometime close it because it is full. Such a lovely place Beautiful, clean and a wonderful place to swim, or just to come relax and have a picnic. Small beach lined store fronts with a clean beach. The best beaches in Ontario, I dare say 🤣 Easily the best beach in Ontario.  Lots of local attractions to explore. Paradise in Ontario. Beautiful beach! Nicest confia  each I've ever been too Perfect summer beach. Come early as they close when they are full. Amazing beaches! Clean clear water. Great beach with clean facilities and beautiful sand. Great beach I was scammed at the Sandbanks BY SANDBANKS staff.  I paid the $16 parking permit and displayed it on the dashboard. Hours later I found a ticket for $30 for ""failure to display by parking person named W. Matthews. I called the park ... Absolutely beautiful. It feel like I'm in Cuba. The beach is amazing! Natural beauty specially the area which covers with sand dunes. Ontario lake shows itself in full force and beauty. Facilities are good and park is clean. Good for camping or a day trip. Great beach go early to avoid the parking line. Loved this beach, the sand is so soft and fun to relax in! Great place to camp and have a dip in lake Ontario, the place is often very crowed which is a bit of drawback. It is as well a great place to bring your bike. We had a great afternoon exploring the dunes. They are greedy bastards.. Its suposed to be a free provincial park. But we spent over 200 dollars.. Sux balls dont go!!! Love the place!!! We rented the Jacques cottage for a girls weekend as we have done the last couple of years the weekend after Thanksgiving but we were very disappointed. The water pressure was horrible. Barely could have a shower and the water from the ... Great park with super soft sand! Best beaches on Canadian east coast Nice beaches Enjoyes my time there and the views! Will be going back One of my favourite beaches in Canada. Amazing provincial park
Great beaches and trails Wonderful beaches and great water. This seems to be the spot where Lake Ontario is most beautiful. Entry fee to the park is $16 but it's worth the price.  Amazing natural beauty....best sunsets. It is very busy though and alot of disrespectful campers during busy times.... This place is incredible! Great place to camp. Lots of people and not too far from major cities. Nice big park and they seem to be adding lots of sites  The province should spend more money and clean the beach more often it's gotten dirty over the years Great park Beautiful park but book early if you want a spot! Well kept with excellent beaches Awesome beach great place to getaway Great beach @www move to the county.  Com Got a parking ticket for being there about 30mins. There parking dispenser only allowed me to pay 11$ for a senior pass which was the cheapest. Thought I'd take my chances as there was nobody in the park but sure enough patrol officer caught me. Nice long sandy beach with lots of sand. Great location near Kingston, ON  Amazing camping views....giant park but nice wide sites and a beach just like N.C obx Car camping at its best. Ideal for families with young children. Spending the day at Sandbanks is one of my most cherished memories. So much family fun with each visit. Love to body surf the waves Best camping place with sandy Shores ever seen Looks like the ocean Beautiful sand beach not crazy busy  Nice scenery, overcrowded and overpriced Great camping,very nice beach. If you love soft Sandy beaches, this is the provincial Park for you. Busy, but arguably the best beach in Ontario. Been here many times ...it never disapoints for sunsets Very nice park, enjoyed our vacation although beaches were closed for swimming for the first few days. Beautiful white sand I went with my family wife, son (11) and my daughter (9), and we loved, the camp side, the main washrooms was pretty and clean, the washrooms close to the camp site was not so clean, but was good, the water and the sand was very good. ... Prettiest beach I've seen Nice place but the toilet situation was disgusting for the price. Dead fish on the beach too and nobody seemed to concerned about picking them up and getting rid of the smell. Beautiful place though. Too bad they dont take care of it. Great location, beaches have very soft sand. Lots of areas to walk and bike. Not enough shower or toilet facilities though. Awesome sand beaches.  Not too crowded and easy parking.  Each car is $17/day. We had a wonderful experience during our stay at Sandbanks. The hiking trails, beach and camping were very memorable. Long sandy beaches.  A great way to spend the day. Really nice beach! Oh but mind the centipedes, during the summer they literally infest the sand climbing up the slope to get into the beach. Fantastic Long line to get in to the beach. Crowded but not too bad.  Amazing beach!  Washrooms aren't always the cleanest and it is very crowded in the summer.  The best time to go is September after the labour day long weekend.   Great beach, but not the cleanest PP we visited with our RV. We found the facilities for camper a bit lacking and overall very busy and crowded. The beach makes up for a lot but that is about it. We stayed at other PP's with our RV on this trip and found them what roomier and cleaner. Love it Service at desk sucks big time... Awesome Nice beach It was a very great experience. The beach is so clean and the water is so clear . Overall we had a very nice weekend. Very pretty with nice beaches! Great dunes... but busy Great beaches and places for picnics. Provincial park people why do you insist on charging same day price for people that arrive early morning and those of us that like to arrive after mid-afternoon and maybe only stay an hour? Been going to sandbanks since I was 10 days old amazing experience get an electrical site  Beautiful Great place to hang out with the kids Very nice park, beautiful views Such a beautiful beach Everything you thought it was, endless white sand beaches, clear warm water Love the animal friendly area! Great park with multiple beaches and other areas to enjoy. I come here every year for a week and it is the best place to camp as well as going to the different beaches!   Love sandbanks! I go there all the time, its beautiful all year. Nice place to visit Beautiful Busy and too crowded to enjoy. If you don't mind crowded areas and next to impossible parking...

An exceptional picnicking site including a children’s adventure playground.
Spring and fall spawning runs for Rainbow Trout and Chinook salmon. Watch the fish struggle over each ledge of this cascading waterfall to spawn upstream.
Excellent fishing.

Needed to use the toilets in the parking lot above the falls where we parked. We have never been more shocked and disgusted in a Provincial Park facility. Excrement ... Decent campground at Sauble Falls and close to Sauble Beach. Great bathroom, shower facilities. We did see 2 wood roaches during our 4 day stay though. Excellent customer service and friendly staff. Good site sizes easily accessible. We had parking for 4 cars when friends surprised us with a visit. Short day trip to Sauble Beach was heavenly. Short day trip to Tobermory was ... These grounds are the least private of all the provincial parks I’ve ever been to. We could see the cars on the highway from our campsite... the highway was on the other side of the fence... not impressed. I would go to a private park next time I’m in Sauble area Went here to check out the falls and it is very beautiful. It is a tourist attraction so in the warm weather it is packed with people. Parking is expensive but there are a few cheaper lots if you are willing to walk a few minutes. The ... Went camping here for the first time with my wife during Fall and enjoyed the beautiful falls and unique rock formations. Was even lucky to spot salmon in the water. I have been camping at provincial parks since inception, and my friends and I have been going annually for nearly a decade, never before have I dealt with such strict noise policies. We booked a group site, and had about 10 people with ... Beautiful park worth going .  5 minutes from Sauble beach. Beautiful campsites. Nice clean facilities. Very nice staff. Lots to do in the area. We camped here and have an awesome experience. The girls that work there were all super friendly and very helpful. The site was very large and it had a cooking grate over the fire pit, thought that was pretty cool. It was very lovely and very minimal bugs and mostly just at night mosquitoes. Incredible natural wonder where you are allowed to swim and dive off the falls. People were swimming the rapids and jumping off the falls into the pool.  Great fun for old and young ... highly recommended.  No admission fee but there is ... Due to the character limit, my full review cannot be provided here. Please refer to the attached screenshots. Beautiful park! Sites were a great size and private enough. We rented kayaks for an hour down the river and did some exploring it was fantastic. Would highly recommend! It was a very nice experience. Felt very happy. I would rate it 5 stars. Happy Entry and Felt sad to miss that place. #nice #good #happy #google #maps #googlemaps #localguides #contributions #localguide #exiting #missing #feeling #place Tree coverage was fantastic since it provided much needed shade during noon day sun. Our lot size was kind of small compared to some of the other ones. Would be a good idea if they had dimension to the sites so that you can reserve one that fits your needs. The main beach area is only a few kilometers down the road.👍 Great provincial camp grounds. Staff were very friendly at the front gate and make checking in very pleasant. Camp sites are not very private but overlook the river which is nice to wake up too. If you forget something these are several stores close to the camp. The river was a blast to spend some time in. Beautiful Campground, see lots of nature up close, short drive to Sauble Beach, clean brand new Washroom building with Shower rooms. Good size campsites all with 2 picnic tables. Quiet & peaceful little spot not too far out of the way on a beautiful winding road thru a tunnel of gorgeous autumn leaves. ITS A MUST SEE. You won't regret it! Beautiful beach very nice clean park. Nice water fall behind the park all in all fun times To busy with people, find a better time to visit This Park is very nice and very small. Its lane ways are the old style narrow one lane roads that provincial parks used to have.
The waterfall is amazing but it's hit and miss depending how high or low the river is.
The park is split in ... We went the first week in May and had a great time!  The park was almost empty so the kids had free reign for biking and exploring.  We stayed in the north section and the bathrooms were great.  The fishing was easily accessible and ... Beautiful falls! It is a hidden gem. The parking is plenty. They have camping facilities as well. Clean washrooms with running water. Shower stalls for campers are also there. 
The rocks can be slippery. Be careful when getting on to the ... Going in the fall is lovely. The colors are amazing The falls itself is beautiful for that I’d vote 5 stars(yay nature!).  The parking was super crowded. Basically minimal amenities, washrooms brings a fly infested outhouse.  nice stop before or after the beach, parking at the ... Fun to walk around.  It's really about the nature and nothing to do with value added.  A little pricey seeing as it doesn't appear to be maintained, but rather capitalizing on work done long ago.  Should be free, though the brief boardwalk would cost something to fix. The most fun I've had in a long time, the Falls are cascading and you can walk out from the boardwalk and fight the current.It was just over 5.00 to park. You are close to the amazing Sauble Beach and check out the Sauble Sands just up ... Breathtaking views! Great for fishing if you're interested, and great for a one day getaway. It's a great park for taking a stroll, having a picnic, taking pictures, and generally enjoying yourself. It's a great place for family. There is a smaller parking spot past the main provincial park that allows you to park for hourly ... This is such a beautiful place its not a high falls but pretty Really nice spot to look at the falls. They are small but beautiful. Parking is a bit pricey even though there isn't much to do or see. Maybe stop here for a picnic as it's a great spot for that. The falls and the park was great. Even kids can walk through the falls with parents supervision of course. A very nice and shady place to do picnicking. Park is very well maintained and washrooms nice and clean.  Campsites have some trees and good privacy on most sites.   One of the smaller provincial parks.  Sites available right on the river so you can launch your canoe right from your site if you want. Even when busy still lots of room to explore and have fun. Great place to enjoy for anyone young and old! The site is interesting. The falls are nice.  Paid to park for the 10 minutes i spent there.... Spent 2 nights there. Staff was friendly when checking in and roaming around at night. Facilities are very clean and up to date, more than what would you expect when going frontcountry camping. Super close to the falls, the beach as well ... Great place to bring family and friends. There's a basketball court and a beach volleyball area for sports lovers and regular park benches to set up a nice picnic/bbq. Small trail leads to the falls; truly wonderful scenery! This park is super quiet all day and at night through the week. Unfortunately the sites are anything but private and are very small. I’m not really sure I’d come back. Beautiful area. Lovely falls. You can swim at the bottom of it. Liked the place very much. Natural waterfall. Nice to have bath. Clear force water. Beautiful spot, right by the river. Close to sauble beach. Bathrooms didn't get cleaned enough, very often out of toilet paper. Stunning view. Some tables and benches to sit and relax. You can also put your feet into the water and have a foot massage. Nice place for day trip with family or friends Highly recommended. Nice camp sites. Beautiful treed area. Great location for the beach and falls. BUT washrooms and showers too few of and so FILTHY! Very disappointing, so wouldn't recommend this campground because of this. Great park along the river with a staircase style of waterfall to see.  The walk along the river on the east campground side was fantastic as well. Beautiful part with excellent beach just minutes away.  Only downfall are the sites are so close to each other. Beautiful place to visit and jump off the falls. There is a small fee for parking. We stayed in the radio free zone, but that did not guarantee quiet.  Unlike private campgrounds, there is not a designated family zone.  
We were awoken the first morn at 0630 by a screaming child. On the second night ~1130, we were stirred by the sounds of a (different) wailing child. Been going to the Tent & Trailer park across the road for a few summers now. Wouldn't go without spending some time at the falls. The falls are beautiful with lots of little spots to check out. Play area for the kids, canoe and paddle ... Nice camp site for families except for a few Yahoo's one note... but the cops took care of them Great place for a swim, picnics and just sight seeing. Kids will LOVE it too. Not much of a falls... More of a river runs through it. Staff was very nice. First camping experience and we're glad to have it in Sauble Falls Campground. ☺ Nice trail, clean washrooms and friendly staff. Gentle, peaceful and quiet. Park out for 2 hr parking for a quick visit (sufficient) or in the park for the whole day. -Park rangers circle every thirty minutes or less if you're in your 20's
-my dog has $4000 worth of training and didnt make a single sound all weekend but they came by and double checked he was on a leash 3 times and warned us to keep ... Amazing waterfalls that you can actually walk on or play or jump into hole or soak yourself in falls.... Literally. Safe and cute place for family and nature lover. Great experience. Awesome waterfall, nice place for wedding photographs. I found the east park had very small campsites and they were really close..no privacy at all. There’s no beach bc they want u to go to Sauble Beach and spend $15 a day for parking..won’t be back I really like watching the water make it's way down the falls. Peacefull to stand on the falls and only hear water rushing around you. Beautiful must see road side stop! They even have convenient parking and a park although the park was closed during winter. The park seems pretty big so I'm sad we missed it but the river we saw was still so pretty! Rangers should be paying more attention to the  deteriorating bathroom conditions than noise on sites. Bathrooms need a lot of attention. 2 inches of water in the women’s bathroom Gorgeous, great little stop - water shoes recommend. During our stay at the park we ran into a large issue involving some serious power trip action. While crossing from campsite A to campsite B with a single opened beer at around 530 pm, we were approached from behind by park rangers and ... Falls is spectacular in view its just its not that clean when we went there are algae and water is not that clean Nice park but washrooms and showers need to be cleaned more often. Maybe people could be more còurteous and not make such a mess!!!!!!! Well maintained park. Private sites. Absolutely lovely falls. Good place to spend some time on a hot day. Had a great time and are going back again next week. Beautiful scenery and lots of fun jumping off the  falls! This tiny provincial is well worth of the money, within seconds of walk, you can see the whole small falls, which is very nice and wide, in addition, you can learn the history of early settlers here. Nice falls. Good place to spend the weekend Awesome place! Must to see! Free access! Beautiful place to enjoy nature. Beatiful and ypu can go on and enjoy the water Lovely park with a great step waterfall. Later in the year you can come and see the salmon run. 
Our only issue was with the wasps, so we had to eat our lunch in the car. But I would recommend this park to anyone looking for a quiet and ... This place is really nice. When we went it was just before summer, so it wasn't packed (we were the only ones at the falls....a few kids were in the park). We didn't go in the falls like the picture shows... I wouldn't have known people ... Nice park great hiking trail inside park I love this place! Amazing fun. Beautiful place . Great for picnics and family time it’s a cozy nook. Very good and enjoying place, to visit with family & friends Cool place to watch the salmon run in the fall Beautiful area, just a little far. Unfortunately high water levels left us unable to rent the paddle boats! But lovely as always otherwise the falls are different than what I expected but fun Must see when in Sauvle Beach Best views ever and most important 5mins from the beach!! Beautiful and clean falls.  One can even sit/stand on some rocks for pictures(not deep).  Many different picturesque areas to look at.  Paid parking is at a walking distance.  Washrooms need attention by the park staff, otherwise a fun place to be. I've never camped here but spent the day here several times. Canoeing/kayaking here is AWESOME! I always come to the rental place by the bridge and the prices are great and it's a really fun time. Love kayaking up the river and it's also ... Nice clean beach with nice shops and restaurants Near nature and amenities. Small enjoyable park for tenting/small Rvs. Beautiful place. Must visit A very popular provincial park, possibly due to location. The falls themselves can be impressive if there has been lots of rainfall. The campsites and washroom facilities are of a lowering standard than most provincial parks. Since the ... Lovely with fall colors. It's ok. Washrooms not so clean. Parking machine is a pain in the neck. The views are different and interesting. Good visit. The cost of parking seemed a bit high. I liked that there was a liability sign telling people not to be dangerous around and near the water but that people still have the option to go ... Beautiful park. Busy on the long weekend! Delightful view of the falls. Perfect camp site. Absolutely gutting not worth the money u spend on parking Beautiful park! Wait all winter to come back love it here So beautiful! An absolute treasure! Beautiful campsites and just a few minutes walk from the falls. The bathrooms are clean enough but the showers are pretty dirty. Full of cobwebs, dead bugs and lots of spiders. Other than that everything was great. Very friendly park staff. Not an awful lot to do here if you're not fishing or kayaking. 

Parking is paid, and they charge a minimum of 2 hours/$5.75. A bit of a rip off considering the average visit is likely much shorter.

Washrooms are typical of a provincial ... nothing too interesting. small falls Very noisy! Lots of dirt bikes riding around Good place to spend a weekend. Great place to see nature I had a great time relaxing here. Kayaking was cool. Beach nearby was top notch. A place I will camp again when it's not too busy. ""Best beach ever"" that kids said! Smaller of the provincial parks. Close by to Sauble beach and Wiarton. The shapes of the campsites are bit weird, but some campsites are awesome and some are very close to the river. There are lot of fun in this park such as playing in the falls , volley ball in the campground and very close to sauble beach. Their washrooms are well maintained as well. Staying at b&b next to park Small falls where you can complete a small cliff jump. The falls were small, but wonderful. Very quiet and you forget there are other campers. Nice park. Large sites. Not as private as most provincial parks and you are very close to you neighbours. But overall a solid place to camp. Nice quiet and peaceful. We camped here, in our trailer, in 2015. A typical Provincial Park with some beautiful scenery. Walking the park is nice, it really does have some  very nice camping sites. We have stayed at nicer provincial parks, but also stayed at worse ones as well. Amazing place, just 5 min away from Sauble beach. Loved the picturesque view here. Make sure you spend more time here. You could also do canoeing here. Not much to see, I should of looked at the images on Google first. Spent a week in Sauble Falls Provincial Park.  Quiet, great park for the kids, and decent sized campsites.  Most areas of the park have very close sites, however we were able to book five sites together for our family of 34.  Great for a family experience with individual sites.   Very nice beach, has a dog friendly part which is what were looking for. Its between the posts. Enjoy able beach, the water is on the cool side ans the sand is white. Good Salmon and Trout fishing, friendly hosts. This is one of 2 parks we made as a tradition to come to for Thanksgiving. Beautiful autumn colours  One of the most wonderfulest places to camp Nice camp site, close to the falls This was one of the nicest parks we have been to in Ontario and we loved every minute of it. Beautiful waterfalls. No fish jumping yet. Small campground, sites a bit close together. No great spot to fish or launch boats, even though right on the river. Really great proximity to hiking and Sauble Beach Good for boating and lots of slippery along the way if you want to walk  and be carefull from the bugs in the area Great place for a weekend get away, only about an hour drive from Tobermory. 

the falls are a must see if your in the sauble beach area.

washrooms and showers are a little outdated, other than that its a great place for a visit..

OPP are on the look out for partygoers!! Fun to walk in the falls! This is a great place A beautiful park, with campgrounds along the Sauble River and Sauble Falls, located in Southern Bruce Peninsula.  Private lots are a plenty. 
A short walk away from a Historical site which over looks Sauble Falls, and a short drive to view the Great Lake Huron! Fun, beautiful, get sites, clean Nice walking paths and safe to see the falls Clean bathrooms and nice campsites great park but they don't sell fire wood so bring some with you or buy before you get there. DON'T! let anyone convince you to going to the store up the street that guy is a crook! charged me 8.50 plus tax which he said was 10$ but if ... Very good place Fun place to be The park rangers were way too strict. I played a little music on my phone while I was making the fire, not knowing that we were in a radio free zone. Without any warning they gave me a ticket, and evicted everybody from the campsite. ... You have to go it’s beautiful! Sauble Falls is very beautiful & peaceful We love renting kayaks & exploring the river. Nice small provincial camp ground. Very close the falls and lots of sites with river access for those with canoes, kayaks, paddleboards etc. Well maintained washrooms nearby. Also has access to the sauble trail Horrible experience, got kicked out for being of a different race, I can't believe this happened especially in our great Canadian country. Park ranger gave us one warning to turn down the music and when we did he came back with a ticket ... Fill stations not clearly marked Haven't been here...wanted to three times for this upcoming season (2017) I went on to book it. I went on at 2 am this morning and it said I can't book until 7 am. There was 2 trailer sites left at that point for 2 nights. I go on RIGHT ... Fun day. Beautiful,will come again This was our third time going and was greatly disappointed this time around. Facilities weren't clean... staff at the campground seem unhappy and are unpleasant. The site we had was nothing special and the fire ring was full! 

Likely won't be booking here again. Pretty spot, good for a quick visit, small playground on one side. Water currently high and canoe rentals closed. Pay for parking, so choose the $5 2hr option To many noisy people. Park allows people to over book sites... Our neighbours had 30 people in the quiet radio free section.

I am never going back. I love Sauble falls park. It's nicely located near sauble beach which is the best Ontario beach. Great camp site Great place to camp as a family. It's an easy 5 minute drive to the beach, or it can act as a basecamp to explore the Bruce Peninsula.  Beautiful area! We love nature & this park was a ton of fun! Hiking, canoeing & swimming! Definitely will be back! Beautiful... Serene... Beautiful for photography...more cascades than falls,  though. Worth the cost of parking!  Needs more shady and green development around We reserved the Group site and was having a Family reunion but we got a ticket and evicted the first night we got there....the security or whatever he was had no heart and said that we had to leave by 9 am the next day because it was too ... Pretty little cascade. Open to walk across or take a relatively safe dip. Amazing scenic place Good Washroom You can take bath with warm water and quiet place.. Beautiful place nice scenery but sites are small (22' motorhome was a tight fit on a bigger site) Zero privacy- site beside us was so close the camper asked me to turn my camping lights off. Kids everywhere with no adults. Not a big fan of the place but ... Very clean and quiet It's a nice place to visit but don't expect too much. Amazing place. Beautiful stop along the bike ride from Lion's Head to Sauble Beach! Good nothing  spacial Awesome expereince The falls are the best part of this campground. They are low and slow moving enough that even children can play in them. Definitely worth the trip. But the awesome ends there. The sites are small and lack the privacy I've come to expect at provincial parks. And the washrooms are old and tired. Nice place, but cannot spend the whole day there.  My friends family brought me along for their vacation here. And my God is it gorgeous! Having a bathroom and shower to go to is also pretty great.  Electric plug ins! Amazing view great place to visit We went to the (Sauble) falls as a stopover and were a little disappointed. We entered the North park entrance and had to pay for parking for a minimum of 2 hours. The falls weren't too impressive but that may depend on the amount of ... Lots of trails to walk. Canoe rental available. Large grilling area and picnic tables. Public indoor wash rooms. Parking is expensive.  Washrooms are dirty and you have to hike to go to the showers. The site itself is quite small compared to other parks, and the park rangers take their jobs waaaaay too seriously (they seemed to have mastered the art of douchebaggery). ... Small and the washrooms are basic.....campsites pretty open.... Really nice park. Nice camp store. Has some nice campsites. Nice roads around the sites. Really nice Beach and rocks to climb out to The only good thing about this park is its proximity to Sauble Beach and the Sauble River. Showers are dates. Some fixtures (toilets) were leaking others (shower) handle not secured) TOTAL lack of ANY privacy. Noisy park vehicles touring ... Great spot for a picnic and splashing around a bit in the water, but don't expect to be able to swim or hike around. For the price of entry we actually expected there would be more to see, but it wasn't bad. Great park with friendly staff and nice facilities So beautiful. So glad we had a chance to visit.  beach and campground were excelent scenery too enjoy Best provincial park for camping in Ontario. Beautiful sites, clean and modern facilities, and more importantly: Waterfalls to sit/play in 5 minutes from your site, a beautiful beach 5 min drive away, and a cute little town with a solid assortment of food a 10 min drive away. Nothing but harassment. With 5 kids ages 6, 8,9,10 and 14.  Having a normal conversation with the 14 yr old after 11 pm and told to be quite   Unbelievable. Never again. I guess I should be texting to my kid after 11 pm.   Beautiful!!! Very clean and family friendly! Excellent place for camping, activities for kids and adults, clean and good bathrooms The so called ""non-reservable"" sites are available to book the week before they are needed. I don't think that's the reason to have ""non-reservable"". Offers a nice cascading waterfall with subtle drops. You are able to sit right in the water which is pretty cool. Surrounding area is great. Some campsites are downright horrible as far as privacy is concerned. The park rangers are way too strict and are out to sap the fun out of a weekend under the stars. If I wanted to go to bed at 11, I'd be staying at home. These falls are awesome to play in, in the summer! Really fun to jump off the falls but also super dangerous  very clean and accessible park. bathrooms were not as clean as I would like but for a campground it's good. showers had good hot water.  The falls themselves is lackluster. Not much to do but take a few pictures. Camping, Beach, Waterfall. Watersports, clean air. Easy to approach..one can spend a whole day who wants loneliness with beautiful Nature surrounding!!! The falls are low and flat so it is easy for lots of people to enjoy a refreshing swim.  It is a very pretty spot with walking trails and campsites to enjoy an overnight as well. Get ruins of old wind mill. Can safely enjoy the rapids, with minimal gear. Great fishing spot.  Stayed in East campground electrical area.  Some of the smallest and least private sites I've ever seen in a provincial park.  Highly recommend that you try the unserviced sites, which have tree cover and are closer to the camping ... Camping sites are small and tight and very close to each other Nice place to stay and relax with the view Beautiful cascading waterfall with good diving spot. Kayaking, canoeing, waterboarding. Campground and children play area nearby. Pristine and serene. Great site with lots to do for the family. Amazing launch for paddling the Sable River  and a very cool chance to swim in the waterfall! Beautiful Love it! Nice well maintained park!  Nice clean picnic spot Great beaches,good restaurants,hotels for a most enjoyable weekend outing with your loved ones and family.Far away from the maddening crowds.  Nice trek route to get to see the falls. Make sure you are going after the rainfall otherwise theh willl be dry and empty Beautiful Good for a short visit. Nothing too exciting though. Gorgeous! Water was super high so no walking in the falls but was still beautiful to see Very clean, large sites, and plenty of washroom/water access campground wide. Bring some bug spray and maybe a tiki torch, there is quite a few mosquitoes in the summertime at this park! Nice area but camping booked up 3 to 4 months prior to weekends Not much of a beach This place has a water fall , camping area The only negative was the weather.  As per Christine, she must of had bad neighbors who complained.  The people across from me were having tons of fun and noisy, good for them, no need to complain.  I hope Christine gives it another try :) Paddled up the river.   Wonderful, calm river.  The waterfalls are fun to play in. Cheaper price for canoeing and kayaking...
Slippery surface on falls... good to be careful while with children... Fun place to stop, but parking prices are pretty steep. Fun place to come in the summer for a swim! Also good for fishing. Fall was beautiful. Not very crowded  Lovely place to relax looking to the river Cleanest washrooms in all of Ontario  Park was great, park rangers were ass holes who were trying to make problems where there were none all because we were a group of young guys.  Sauble falls paddle boats suck big time
Paddle systems are beatout and very hard to peddle to paddle save your money and do somethimg else Fun spit to wade in the river and explore. Can rent canoes, kayaks and paddle boats. VERY tightly packed sites and the park is essentially a cheap motel for people going to Sauble Beach Great camping place. Lovely, low-key park. Boat rentals are affordable.  Great place to visit.  Not to impress Campsites are close together without much privacy.  Every year the price goes up.  We stay in Sauble Beach every year and visit Sauble Falls often.  Last time it was $8 to park, now it is $14.  That is gouging and ridiculous.  Parking at the beach is $15 now, too!  They have killed tourism around here with these ridiculous fees.  Will not return. Was there 40yrs ago remember waterfalls was yellow water and in toilets water ran yellow   It's okay place to go. Nothing much there staff tried to intimidate us, not going back. The scenery is nice but there's little privacy between sites since they're so close together. Staff were like cops when I signed in and not pleasant at all - perhaps I disrupted their conversation. Facilities were nice and we enjoyed a ... Great location with the Falls being a 2 minute walk and the beach being so close. The only issue we had was the bathrooms needed more maintenance and cleaning during the day, especially on the weekends. Same basic setup you'd expect from a Provincial park.  No surprises. Sites are kinda small. No firewood at the park, if you're coming from Toronto, best deal is $3/bag @ Hwy6/10 meets grey rd 10😊😊 It was ok... 3 out of 5... Great place to explore, especially during the summer !!! Awesome for hiking tubing kayaking Need pay parking to see the falls, the trail is short. First time here and I can't say I'll be back again. The park seems over crowded...lots of families (of all kinds!), lots of kids...definitely not for nature lovers who enjoy solitude! The washrooms are old, dirty and they smell like they are overused. Yeah... My husband and I along with another married couple booked sauble falls. We booked the most private site we could find. Everything was fine until dark. These sites are not private at all. We couldnt even talk to each other without a park ... Usually a lot of people but it's pretty fun Awesome Beautiful falls, definitely a stop on the way up the Bruce!  Nice area to stop off or stay the night  Come to this area before going to the beach.  The falls are beautiful and it's close to Sauble Beach. But the campsites are the worst. Had a great day with the kids at Sable Falls. We felt that the day parking was too expensive. Nice camping site Stopped by for day visit had blast with the kids on the falls  My 2nd home. Lovely picnic spot  Beautiful falls!  Not big rig friendly It's beautiful  Nice Park. clean, good maintenance.! Private lots
Clean Beuaticul place to visit.. Small park, very open sites with little natural vegetation. Amazing!!! A very nice place.

Lit","The perfect base camp for visits to nearby Sauble Beach and to explore the Bruce Peninsula.
An exceptional picnicking site including a children’s adventure playground.
Spring and fall spawning runs for Rainbow Trout and Chinook salmon. Watch the fish struggle over each ledge of this cascading waterfall to spawn upstream.
Excellent fishing.
This historic falls used to power a timber mill and generating station. Now flanked by immature forest, the falls are the end of the Rankin River canoe route - ideal for novice canoeists.We stopped for a look around the falls, quite nice until we left. Needed to use the toilets in the parking lot above the falls where we parked. We have never been more shocked and disgusted in a Provincial Park facility. Excrement ... Decent campground at Sauble Falls and close to Sauble Beach. Great bathroom, shower facilities. We did see 2 wood roaches during our 4 day stay though. Excellent customer service and friendly staff. Good site sizes easily accessible. We had parking for 4 cars when friends surprised us with a visit. Short day trip to Sauble Beach was heavenly. Short day trip to Tobermory was ... These grounds are the least private of all the provincial parks I’ve ever been to. We could see the cars on the highway from our campsite... the highway was on the other side of the fence... not impressed. I would go to a private park next time I’m in Sauble area Went here to check out the falls and it is very beautiful. It is a tourist attraction so in the warm weather it is packed with people. Parking is expensive but there are a few cheaper lots if you are willing to walk a few minutes. The ... Went camping here for the first time with my wife during Fall and enjoyed the beautiful falls and unique rock formations. Was even lucky to spot salmon in the water. I have been camping at provincial parks since inception, and my friends and I have been going annually for nearly a decade, never before have I dealt with such strict noise policies. We booked a group site, and had about 10 people with ... Beautiful park worth going .  5 minutes from Sauble beach. Beautiful campsites. Nice clean facilities. Very nice staff. Lots to do in the area. We camped here and have an awesome experience. The girls that work there were all super friendly and very helpful. The site was very large and it had a cooking grate over the fire pit, thought that was pretty cool. It was very lovely and very minimal bugs and mostly just at night mosquitoes. Incredible natural wonder where you are allowed to swim and dive off the falls. People were swimming the rapids and jumping off the falls into the pool.  Great fun for old and young ... highly recommended.  No admission fee but there is ... Due to the character limit, my full review cannot be provided here. Please refer to the attached screenshots. Beautiful park! Sites were a great size and private enough. We rented kayaks for an hour down the river and did some exploring it was fantastic. Would highly recommend! It was a very nice experience. Felt very happy. I would rate it 5 stars. Happy Entry and Felt sad to miss that place. #nice #good #happy #google #maps #googlemaps #localguides #contributions #localguide #exiting #missing #feeling #place Tree coverage was fantastic since it provided much needed shade during noon day sun. Our lot size was kind of small compared to some of the other ones. Would be a good idea if they had dimension to the sites so that you can reserve one that fits your needs. The main beach area is only a few kilometers down the road.👍 Great provincial camp grounds. Staff were very friendly at the front gate and make checking in very pleasant. Camp sites are not very private but overlook the river which is nice to wake up too. If you forget something these are several stores close to the camp. The river was a blast to spend some time in. Beautiful Campground, see lots of nature up close, short drive to Sauble Beach, clean brand new Washroom building with Shower rooms. Good size campsites all with 2 picnic tables. Quiet & peaceful little spot not too far out of the way on a beautiful winding road thru a tunnel of gorgeous autumn leaves. ITS A MUST SEE. You won't regret it! Beautiful beach very nice clean park. Nice water fall behind the park all in all fun times To busy with people, find a better time to visit This Park is very nice and very small. Its lane ways are the old style narrow one lane roads that provincial parks used to have.
The waterfall is amazing but it's hit and miss depending how high or low the river is.
The park is split in ... We went the first week in May and had a great time!  The park was almost empty so the kids had free reign for biking and exploring.  We stayed in the north section and the bathrooms were great.  The fishing was easily accessible and ... Beautiful falls! It is a hidden gem. The parking is plenty. They have camping facilities as well. Clean washrooms with running water. Shower stalls for campers are also there. 
The rocks can be slippery. Be careful when getting on to the ... Going in the fall is lovely. The colors are amazing The falls itself is beautiful for that I’d vote 5 stars(yay nature!).  The parking was super crowded. Basically minimal amenities, washrooms brings a fly infested outhouse.  nice stop before or after the beach, parking at the ... Fun to walk around.  It's really about the nature and nothing to do with value added.  A little pricey seeing as it doesn't appear to be maintained, but rather capitalizing on work done long ago.  Should be free, though the brief boardwalk would cost something to fix. The most fun I've had in a long time, the Falls are cascading and you can walk out from the boardwalk and fight the current.It was just over 5.00 to park. You are close to the amazing Sauble Beach and check out the Sauble Sands just up ... Breathtaking views! Great for fishing if you're interested, and great for a one day getaway. It's a great park for taking a stroll, having a picnic, taking pictures, and generally enjoying yourself. It's a great place for family. There is a smaller parking spot past the main provincial park that allows you to park for hourly ... This is such a beautiful place its not a high falls but pretty Really nice spot to look at the falls. They are small but beautiful. Parking is a bit pricey even though there isn't much to do or see. Maybe stop here for a picnic as it's a great spot for that. The falls and the park was great. Even kids can walk through the falls with parents supervision of course. A very nice and shady place to do picnicking. Park is very well maintained and washrooms nice and clean.  Campsites have some trees and good privacy on most sites.   One of the smaller provincial parks.  Sites available right on the river so you can launch your canoe right from your site if you want. Even when busy still lots of room to explore and have fun. Great place to enjoy for anyone young and old! The site is interesting. The falls are nice.  Paid to park for the 10 minutes i spent there.... Spent 2 nights there. Staff was friendly when checking in and roaming around at night. Facilities are very clean and up to date, more than what would you expect when going frontcountry camping. Super close to the falls, the beach as well ... Great place to bring family and friends. There's a basketball court and a beach volleyball area for sports lovers and regular park benches to set up a nice picnic/bbq. Small trail leads to the falls; truly wonderful scenery! This park is super quiet all day and at night through the week. Unfortunately the sites are anything but private and are very small. I’m not really sure I’d come back. Beautiful area. Lovely falls. You can swim at the bottom of it. Liked the place very much. Natural waterfall. Nice to have bath. Clear force water. Beautiful spot, right by the river. Close to sauble beach. Bathrooms didn't get cleaned enough, very often out of toilet paper. Stunning view. Some tables and benches to sit and relax. You can also put your feet into the water and have a foot massage. Nice place for day trip with family or friends Highly recommended. Nice camp sites. Beautiful treed area. Great location for the beach and falls. BUT washrooms and showers too few of and so FILTHY! Very disappointing, so wouldn't recommend this campground because of this. Great park along the river with a staircase style of waterfall to see.  The walk along the river on the east campground side was fantastic as well. Beautiful part with excellent beach just minutes away.  Only downfall are the sites are so close to each other. Beautiful place to visit and jump off the falls. There is a small fee for parking. We stayed in the radio free zone, but that did not guarantee quiet.  Unlike private campgrounds, there is not a designated family zone.  
We were awoken the first morn at 0630 by a screaming child. On the second night ~1130, we were stirred by the sounds of a (different) wailing child. Been going to the Tent & Trailer park across the road for a few summers now. Wouldn't go without spending some time at the falls. The falls are beautiful with lots of little spots to check out. Play area for the kids, canoe and paddle ... Nice camp site for families except for a few Yahoo's one note... but the cops took care of them Great place for a swim, picnics and just sight seeing. Kids will LOVE it too. Not much of a falls... More of a river runs through it. Staff was very nice. First camping experience and we're glad to have it in Sauble Falls Campground. ☺ Nice trail, clean washrooms and friendly staff. Gentle, peaceful and quiet. Park out for 2 hr parking for a quick visit (sufficient) or in the park for the whole day. -Park rangers circle every thirty minutes or less if you're in your 20's
-my dog has $4000 worth of training and didnt make a single sound all weekend but they came by and double checked he was on a leash 3 times and warned us to keep ... Amazing waterfalls that you can actually walk on or play or jump into hole or soak yourself in falls.... Literally. Safe and cute place for family and nature lover. Great experience. Awesome waterfall, nice place for wedding photographs. I found the east park had very small campsites and they were really close..no privacy at all. There’s no beach bc they want u to go to Sauble Beach and spend $15 a day for parking..won’t be back I really like watching the water make it's way down the falls. Peacefull to stand on the falls and only hear water rushing around you. Beautiful must see road side stop! They even have convenient parking and a park although the park was closed during winter. The park seems pretty big so I'm sad we missed it but the river we saw was still so pretty! Rangers should be paying more attention to the  deteriorating bathroom conditions than noise on sites. Bathrooms need a lot of attention. 2 inches of water in the women’s bathroom Gorgeous, great little stop - water shoes recommend. During our stay at the park we ran into a large issue involving some serious power trip action. While crossing from campsite A to campsite B with a single opened beer at around 530 pm, we were approached from behind by park rangers and ... Falls is spectacular in view its just its not that clean when we went there are algae and water is not that clean Nice park but washrooms and showers need to be cleaned more often. Maybe people could be more còurteous and not make such a mess!!!!!!! Well maintained park. Private sites. Absolutely lovely falls. Good place to spend some time on a hot day. Had a great time and are going back again next week. Beautiful scenery and lots of fun jumping off the  falls! This tiny provincial is well worth of the money, within seconds of walk, you can see the whole small falls, which is very nice and wide, in addition, you can learn the history of early settlers here. Nice falls. Good place to spend the weekend Awesome place! Must to see! Free access! Beautiful place to enjoy nature. Beatiful and ypu can go on and enjoy the water Lovely park with a great step waterfall. Later in the year you can come and see the salmon run. 
Our only issue was with the wasps, so we had to eat our lunch in the car. But I would recommend this park to anyone looking for a quiet and ... This place is really nice. When we went it was just before summer, so it wasn't packed (we were the only ones at the falls....a few kids were in the park). We didn't go in the falls like the picture shows... I wouldn't have known people ... Nice park great hiking trail inside park I love this place! Amazing fun. Beautiful place . Great for picnics and family time it’s a cozy nook. Very good and enjoying place, to visit with family & friends Cool place to watch the salmon run in the fall Beautiful area, just a little far. Unfortunately high water levels left us unable to rent the paddle boats! But lovely as always otherwise the falls are different than what I expected but fun Must see when in Sauvle Beach Best views ever and most important 5mins from the beach!! Beautiful and clean falls.  One can even sit/stand on some rocks for pictures(not deep).  Many different picturesque areas to look at.  Paid parking is at a walking distance.  Washrooms need attention by the park staff, otherwise a fun place to be. I've never camped here but spent the day here several times. Canoeing/kayaking here is AWESOME! I always come to the rental place by the bridge and the prices are great and it's a really fun time. Love kayaking up the river and it's also ... Nice clean beach with nice shops and restaurants Near nature and amenities. Small enjoyable park for tenting/small Rvs. Beautiful place. Must visit A very popular provincial park, possibly due to location. The falls themselves can be impressive if there has been lots of rainfall. The campsites and washroom facilities are of a lowering standard than most provincial parks. Since the ... Lovely with fall colors. It's ok. Washrooms not so clean. Parking machine is a pain in the neck. The views are different and interesting. Good visit. The cost of parking seemed a bit high. I liked that there was a liability sign telling people not to be dangerous around and near the water but that people still have the option to go ... Beautiful park. Busy on the long weekend! Delightful view of the falls. Perfect camp site. Absolutely gutting not worth the money u spend on parking Beautiful park! Wait all winter to come back love it here So beautiful! An absolute treasure! Beautiful campsites and just a few minutes walk from the falls. The bathrooms are clean enough but the showers are pretty dirty. Full of cobwebs, dead bugs and lots of spiders. Other than that everything was great. Very friendly park staff. Not an awful lot to do here if you're not fishing or kayaking. 

Parking is paid, and they charge a minimum of 2 hours/$5.75. A bit of a rip off considering the average visit is likely much shorter.

Washrooms are typical of a provincial ... nothing too interesting. small falls Very noisy! Lots of dirt bikes riding around Good place to spend a weekend. Great place to see nature I had a great time relaxing here. Kayaking was cool. Beach nearby was top notch. A place I will camp again when it's not too busy. ""Best beach ever"" that kids said! Smaller of the provincial parks. Close by to Sauble beach and Wiarton. The shapes of the campsites are bit weird, but some campsites are awesome and some are very close to the river. There are lot of fun in this park such as playing in the falls , volley ball in the campground and very close to sauble beach. Their washrooms are well maintained as well. Staying at b&b next to park Small falls where you can complete a small cliff jump. The falls were small, but wonderful. Very quiet and you forget there are other campers. Nice park. Large sites. Not as private as most provincial parks and you are very close to you neighbours. But overall a solid place to camp. Nice quiet and peaceful. We camped here, in our trailer, in 2015. A typical Provincial Park with some beautiful scenery. Walking the park is nice, it really does have some  very nice camping sites. We have stayed at nicer provincial parks, but also stayed at worse ones as well. Amazing place, just 5 min away from Sauble beach. Loved the picturesque view here. Make sure you spend more time here. You could also do canoeing here. Not much to see, I should of looked at the images on Google first. Spent a week in Sauble Falls Provincial Park.  Quiet, great park for the kids, and decent sized campsites.  Most areas of the park have very close sites, however we were able to book five sites together for our family of 34.  Great for a family experience with individual sites.   Very nice beach, has a dog friendly part which is what were looking for. Its between the posts. Enjoy able beach, the water is on the cool side ans the sand is white. Good Salmon and Trout fishing, friendly hosts. This is one of 2 parks we made as a tradition to come to for Thanksgiving. Beautiful autumn colours  One of the most wonderfulest places to camp Nice camp site, close to the falls This was one of the nicest parks we have been to in Ontario and we loved every minute of it. Beautiful waterfalls. No fish jumping yet. Small campground, sites a bit close together. No great spot to fish or launch boats, even though right on the river. Really great proximity to hiking and Sauble Beach Good for boating and lots of slippery along the way if you want to walk  and be carefull from the bugs in the area Great place for a weekend get away, only about an hour drive from Tobermory. 

the falls are a must see if your in the sauble beach area.

washrooms and showers are a little outdated, other than that its a great place for a visit..

OPP are on the look out for partygoers!! Fun to walk in the falls! This is a great place A beautiful park, with campgrounds along the Sauble River and Sauble Falls, located in Southern Bruce Peninsula.  Private lots are a plenty. 
A short walk away from a Historical site which over looks Sauble Falls, and a short drive to view the Great Lake Huron! Fun, beautiful, get sites, clean Nice walking paths and safe to see the falls Clean bathrooms and nice campsites great park but they don't sell fire wood so bring some with you or buy before you get there. DON'T! let anyone convince you to going to the store up the street that guy is a crook! charged me 8.50 plus tax which he said was 10$ but if ... Very good place Fun place to be The park rangers were way too strict. I played a little music on my phone while I was making the fire, not knowing that we were in a radio free zone. Without any warning they gave me a ticket, and evicted everybody from the campsite. ... You have to go it’s beautiful! Sauble Falls is very beautiful & peaceful We love renting kayaks & exploring the river. Nice small provincial camp ground. Very close the falls and lots of sites with river access for those with canoes, kayaks, paddleboards etc. Well maintained washrooms nearby. Also has access to the sauble trail Horrible experience, got kicked out for being of a different race, I can't believe this happened especially in our great Canadian country. Park ranger gave us one warning to turn down the music and when we did he came back with a ticket ... Fill stations not clearly marked Haven't been here...wanted to three times for this upcoming season (2017) I went on to book it. I went on at 2 am this morning and it said I can't book until 7 am. There was 2 trailer sites left at that point for 2 nights. I go on RIGHT ... Fun day. Beautiful,will come again This was our third time going and was greatly disappointed this time around. Facilities weren't clean... staff at the campground seem unhappy and are unpleasant. The site we had was nothing special and the fire ring was full! 

Likely won't be booking here again. Pretty spot, good for a quick visit, small playground on one side. Water currently high and canoe rentals closed. Pay for parking, so choose the $5 2hr option To many noisy people. Park allows people to over book sites... Our neighbours had 30 people in the quiet radio free section.

I am never going back. I love Sauble falls park. It's nicely located near sauble beach which is the best Ontario beach. Great camp site Great place to camp as a family. It's an easy 5 minute drive to the beach, or it can act as a basecamp to explore the Bruce Peninsula.  Beautiful area! We love nature & this park was a ton of fun! Hiking, canoeing & swimming! Definitely will be back! Beautiful... Serene... Beautiful for photography...more cascades than falls,  though. Worth the cost of parking!  Needs more shady and green development around We reserved the Group site and was having a Family reunion but we got a ticket and evicted the first night we got there....the security or whatever he was had no heart and said that we had to leave by 9 am the next day because it was too ... Pretty little cascade. Open to walk across or take a relatively safe dip. Amazing scenic place Good Washroom You can take bath with warm water and quiet place.. Beautiful place nice scenery but sites are small (22' motorhome was a tight fit on a bigger site) Zero privacy- site beside us was so close the camper asked me to turn my camping lights off. Kids everywhere with no adults. Not a big fan of the place but ... Very clean and quiet It's a nice place to visit but don't expect too much. Amazing place. Beautiful stop along the bike ride from Lion's Head to Sauble Beach! Good nothing  spacial Awesome expereince The falls are the best part of this campground. They are low and slow moving enough that even children can play in them. Definitely worth the trip. But the awesome ends there. The sites are small and lack the privacy I've come to expect at provincial parks. And the washrooms are old and tired. Nice place, but cannot spend the whole day there.  My friends family brought me along for their vacation here. And my God is it gorgeous! Having a bathroom and shower to go to is also pretty great.  Electric plug ins! Amazing view great place to visit We went to the (Sauble) falls as a stopover and were a little disappointed. We entered the North park entrance and had to pay for parking for a minimum of 2 hours. The falls weren't too impressive but that may depend on the amount of ... Lots of trails to walk. Canoe rental available. Large grilling area and picnic tables. Public indoor wash rooms. Parking is expensive.  Washrooms are dirty and you have to hike to go to the showers. The site itself is quite small compared to other parks, and the park rangers take their jobs waaaaay too seriously (they seemed to have mastered the art of douchebaggery). ... Small and the washrooms are basic.....campsites pretty open.... Really nice park. Nice camp store. Has some nice campsites. Nice roads around the sites. Really nice Beach and rocks to climb out to The only good thing about this park is its proximity to Sauble Beach and the Sauble River. Showers are dates. Some fixtures (toilets) were leaking others (shower) handle not secured) TOTAL lack of ANY privacy. Noisy park vehicles touring ... Great spot for a picnic and splashing around a bit in the water, but don't expect to be able to swim or hike around. For the price of entry we actually expected there would be more to see, but it wasn't bad. Great park with friendly staff and nice facilities So beautiful. So glad we had a chance to visit.  beach and campground were excelent scenery too enjoy Best provincial park for camping in Ontario. Beautiful sites, clean and modern facilities, and more importantly: Waterfalls to sit/play in 5 minutes from your site, a beautiful beach 5 min drive away, and a cute little town with a solid assortment of food a 10 min drive away. Nothing but harassment. With 5 kids ages 6, 8,9,10 and 14.  Having a normal conversation with the 14 yr old after 11 pm and told to be quite   Unbelievable. Never again. I guess I should be texting to my kid after 11 pm.   Beautiful!!! Very clean and family friendly! Excellent place for camping, activities for kids and adults, clean and good bathrooms The so called ""non-reservable"" sites are available to book the week before they are needed. I don't think that's the reason to have ""non-reservable"". Offers a nice cascading waterfall with subtle drops. You are able to sit right in the water which is pretty cool. Surrounding area is great. Some campsites are downright horrible as far as privacy is concerned. The park rangers are way too strict and are out to sap the fun out of a weekend under the stars. If I wanted to go to bed at 11, I'd be staying at home. These falls are awesome to play in, in the summer! Really fun to jump off the falls but also super dangerous  very clean and accessible park. bathrooms were not as clean as I would like but for a campground it's good. showers had good hot water.  The falls themselves is lackluster. Not much to do but take a few pictures. Camping, Beach, Waterfall. Watersports, clean air. Easy to approach..one can spend a whole day who wants loneliness with beautiful Nature surrounding!!! The falls are low and flat so it is easy for lots of people to enjoy a refreshing swim.  It is a very pretty spot with walking trails and campsites to enjoy an overnight as well. Get ruins of old wind mill. Can safely enjoy the rapids, with minimal gear. Great fishing spot.  Stayed in East campground electrical area.  Some of the smallest and least private sites I've ever seen in a provincial park.  Highly recommend that you try the unserviced sites, which have tree cover and are closer to the camping ... Camping sites are small and tight and very close to each other Nice place to stay and relax with the view Beautiful cascading waterfall with good diving spot. Kayaking, canoeing, waterboarding. Campground and children play area nearby. Pristine and serene. Great site with lots to do for the family. Amazing launch for paddling the Sable River  and a very cool chance to swim in the waterfall! Beautiful Love it! Nice well maintained park!  Nice clean picnic spot Great beaches,good restaurants,hotels for a most enjoyable weekend outing with your loved ones and family.Far away from the maddening crowds.  Nice trek route to get to see the falls. Make sure you are going after the rainfall otherwise theh willl be dry and empty Beautiful Good for a short visit. Nothing too exciting though. Gorgeous! Water was super high so no walking in the falls but was still beautiful to see Very clean, large sites, and plenty of washroom/water access campground wide. Bring some bug spray and maybe a tiki torch, there is quite a few mosquitoes in the summertime at this park! Nice area but camping booked up 3 to 4 months prior to weekends Not much of a beach This place has a water fall , camping area The only negative was the weather.  As per Christine, she must of had bad neighbors who complained.  The people across from me were having tons of fun and noisy, good for them, no need to complain.  I hope Christine gives it another try :) Paddled up the river.   Wonderful, calm river.  The waterfalls are fun to play in. Cheaper price for canoeing and kayaking...
Slippery surface on falls... good to be careful while with children... Fun place to stop, but parking prices are pretty steep. Fun place to come in the summer for a swim! Also good for fishing. Fall was beautiful. Not very crowded  Lovely place to relax looking to the river Cleanest washrooms in all of Ontario  Park was great, park rangers were ass holes who were trying to make problems where there were none all because we were a group of young guys.  Sauble falls paddle boats suck big time
Paddle systems are beatout and very hard to peddle to paddle save your money and do somethimg else Fun spit to wade in the river and explore. Can rent canoes, kayaks and paddle boats. VERY tightly packed sites and the park is essentially a cheap motel for people going to Sauble Beach Great camping place. Lovely, low-key park. Boat rentals are affordable.  Great place to visit.  Not to impress Campsites are close together without much privacy.  Every year the price goes up.  We stay in Sauble Beach every year and visit Sauble Falls often.  Last time it was $8 to park, now it is $14.  That is gouging and ridiculous.  Parking at the beach is $15 now, too!  They have killed tourism around here with these ridiculous fees.  Will not return. Was there 40yrs ago remember waterfalls was yellow water and in toilets water ran yellow   It's okay place to go. Nothing much there staff tried to intimidate us, not going back. The scenery is nice but there's little privacy between sites since they're so close together. Staff were like cops when I signed in and not pleasant at all - perhaps I disrupted their conversation. Facilities were nice and we enjoyed a ... Great location with the Falls being a 2 minute walk and the beach being so close. The only issue we had was the bathrooms needed more maintenance and cleaning during the day, especially on the weekends. Same basic setup you'd expect from a Provincial park.  No surprises. Sites are kinda small. No firewood at the park, if you're coming from Toronto, best deal is $3/bag @ Hwy6/10 meets grey rd 10😊😊 It was ok... 3 out of 5... Great place to explore, especially during the summer !!! Awesome for hiking tubing kayaking Need pay parking to see the falls, the trail is short. First time here and I can't say I'll be back again. The park seems over crowded...lots of families (of all kinds!), lots of kids...definitely not for nature lovers who enjoy solitude! The washrooms are old, dirty and they smell like they are overused. Yeah... My husband and I along with another married couple booked sauble falls. We booked the most private site we could find. Everything was fine until dark. These sites are not private at all. We couldnt even talk to each other without a park ... Usually a lot of people but it's pretty fun Awesome Beautiful falls, definitely a stop on the way up the Bruce!  Nice area to stop off or stay the night  Come to this area before going to the beach.  The falls are beautiful and it's close to Sauble Beach. But the campsites are the worst. Had a great day with the kids at Sable Falls. We felt that the day parking was too expensive. Nice camping site Stopped by for day visit had blast with the kids on the falls  My 2nd home. Lovely picnic spot  Beautiful falls!  Not big rig friendly It's beautiful  Nice Park. clean, good maintenance.! Private lots
Clean Beuaticul place to visit.. Small park, very open sites with little natural vegetation. Amazing!!! A very nice place.

We Went With Family and our 6 friends and their family. This place is not good for camping. Dirty Washroom. No shower in our side of camp ground. Staff are not friendly. We Just ENJOY because of big group. ... The park has some really private camp sites and it is well maintained. The staff are lovely and our kids enjoyed the art in the park activities. We will absolutely go back! A decent Provincial Park with the usual amenities. The site we booked had good shade and privacy. The beach was okay. Great camp sites, well maintained common areas/washroom facilities. Beach isn't maintained, very rocky, lots of dead fish/birds. Dog beach is actually nicer than the dog free beach, except for some irresponsible dog owners that don't ... I am so disappointed with this park.  We arrived with our 5 year old for the weekend, it is so noisy all day!  The proximity of all the campsites not only limit privacy but also lack any sort of sound barrier.  When complaining, the park ... Nice maintained park, quiet and shadowy. Beach is a bit rocky first 10 feet,  then soft send. Good for swimming and camping. Washrooms are basic, but it's not a Warldorf-Astoria, right? There is ONE COMFORT STARTION FOR THE WHOLE PARK. Unfortunately we had site #92, right across from the parking for the comfort station. People from all over the park drive to that station and there are lineups for the 6 showers. After ... Close by for us (Caledonia) and there're always sites available. A quick getaway and much appreciated. Serviced sites have both electric and water. My only complaint: park roads can get to be very dusty. That's why I'm giving a rating of 4. We use 32' fifth wheel. Awesome place, nice beach.. Nice park with waking trail through the forest and boardwalk over a river.  Beach areas had lots of open space for picnics and events.  There were a number of people playing cricket there when I visited. Great Park! Clean and great size.. Just bring bug spray, ticks are in full force but it is like that everywhere right now. Staff was super friendly and helpful, gave us sufficient warning that our original site had flooded and let us pick our new site when wr got there. Highly recommend this park Clean, great spots for camping ! Loved the spot and the beach is awesome. If you want to go for a walk it's great for trails ! Nice park. People and dog beaches. Power and water sites. Friendly staff. Excekent park . Went there for the first time on Spetember long weekend. The only think lacking is a nice beach but that would not keep me from going back Loved it.  It goes without saying, but bring bug spray and good t.p. Always sites available, neat, clean and close by. (We live in Caledonia). We were in a 32' Fifth wheel. Very relaxing, surprised how detached from everything it feels even though is so close to town. Encountered 6 blacklegged ticks around the campground, 4 of which were on our site. Not the most comforting feeling considering we weren't walking around in high grasses and such, just walking around the campground and our campsite. The ... Large sites, We stayed at the in a radio free zone. Loved the place. Lovely camping area.. beach not so great....slimy green shoreline mid summer Nice quiet park. Great great place to relax. Gotta go there. The bathrooms near most sites were sketchy but the 'comfort centre' was very nice. Not too many bugs, overall a good experience. It's really a great place to spend weekend days here. Nice little park, conveniently located. Beautiful place to go camping and a nice beach Big disappointment from time rolled in not much privacy between sites loud group beside us that security never told to be quiet bathrooms were few and far between and only one set of showers that they closed for over a half an hour the ... great campgrounds, the swimming area was not so great A nice park but lacks a nice beach, sites were fair sized, no clear flushable washrooms Well maintained campsite and washrooms, beach left a little to be desired.   Bring sandals or water shoes as there are lots of rocks . Too many rocks at the beach. If you're looking for a good swimming spot... Don't look here. Quiet. No city anywhere near the park. Great park, the privacy on the camp site was outstanding, tones of big trees, great walking trails, beach was nice (though the water levels this year meant that there wasn't as much sandy space as I would like), and the staff were ... There are many nicer parks to go camping. The sites themselves were fairly nice, and a decent size. But the beach was all stoney, the volleyball net was way to low, they ran out of water my first morning so we couldn't use the washrooms. Would definitely find a different campground.  Rangers are power tripping hard at this place... don't laugh past 9:30 pm. Huge open sites nestled in among trees. No bad sites. Short walk to Lake Erie shoreline. Power and water good, bathrooms fine. Tricky to find/access septic dump. Water ran out Friday night of long weekend. Shoreline rocky, not sandy. People very nice. Would return in a heartbeat.  The beach wasn't what I'd call a beach more like a cliff with rocks. The ranges at the night have a hard on for a position of power so, they like to harass people at the slightest bit of noise. The site was pretty clean though. Decent park for camping. One trail for hiking . Very Small beach and full of stones. Water is not so clean. For first time campers and people with children this park is good as they have children park too.  I've camped here two nights . The washrooms are limited ( the proper ones) only 3 for male 3 for female. They have campside washrooms more but they stink and there is no flash. But the showers are good with hot water. Good place for swimming A good experience. Our site was fairly private, with some growth between sites, and there's a nice walking trail. The beach was nice too; particularly the grassy picnic area, but there's not a ton of sand (unless the water was really ... A small park that is pretty quiet. Not much for an extended stay, but great for a short getaway and to have a bonfire. Has one short hiking trail, a dog beach, a play area. Spots are fairly private, especially in the non electric sites. Loved the stay the beach not acceptable for people in wheel chairs or with a problem walking, very rocky. Beach is Rocky but swimable once you get further out. Vault toilets sucks but hey that's camping lol 
Really enjoyed my time here, campsites are nice, spacious & private, grill on fire pit, hiking. Will come again :) Stayed here 2 nights.  Beautiful Park with a great view of Lake Eerie with just a 2 minute walk to the beach.  Our Canadian Geese would fly over our campground every morning and night, a truly wonderful Canadian experience! 
It's also just an hour drive to Niagara Falls!! Spent 2 nights here. Boring campground. They ran out of firewood on our first night and did not get more. The trail they advertise took 25 mins to complete in its entirety. Rangers were rude and unhelpful. The beach was disgusting. We ... Grass not cut ran out of water roads and campsites very dusty cars driving too fast stirring up dust Wish cutbacks didn't affect their boat launch area! Just returned from a two night stay. Site 135. Big site with 30 amp service AND water hookups. I think it's the only PP with that. The Beach is not great, very rocky and lots of seaweed. However, the park is full of mature couples during ... The trails and beaches were completely disgusting. It was just awful to be taking a hike and find more garbage than wildlife. 
On the other hand the staff was very patient with our huge group that we had on the group campsite. Pro tip: the washrooms near the group sites are waaaayyy cleaner than the next closest washrooms. We love taking the grandchildren and we always took the dog here until his passing. Now we have a new puppy to take to the beach and make some more memories  It is a great park but it needs better speed control and better pressure in the shower For us this would be a last resort destination if we can't find a place to go, but want to go camping.  Sites are spacious but next to no privacy (as far as camping goes) meaning there are no tree's or forest, its just wide open. They do ... We had a great long weekend camping at Selkirk! The grounds were very well kept and clean. Staff and rangers were very friendly and welcoming! We had site 24 and it was close to the bathrooms and water tap and was very private with lots ... Selkirk Prov. Park is a good park for some quiet weekend camping. Great cycling along Lake Erie. Good playground for small children It's so refreshing by the lake Erie Close camping grounds to the Niagara region for a quick trip. Great for families and friends.  Clean park. Friendly stuff. Good size camp sites. Nice beach.  Great park. I visited for the day, checked out the campsites and the beach. The smell from the beach is horrendous. I would not swim in the water and I do not recommended it. However we did visit during a heat wave so that probably didn't help with ... Park was awesome nice to see grassy sites only issue was the dog beach was really smelly dogs needed a bath afterwards Beautiful scenery, nice place to visit for a stroll and picnic Had a great time. Sites were clean, large and private. Not at all noisy, even the many dogs who were there - there's a great dog beach - were quiet and well behaved. The beach isn't very large or sandy, but the swimming was great. A good place to go for a weekend getaway. Just returned from a Labour Day camping trip with our 6 year old.  Selkirk is a nice place for a family camping trip.  Its a small park so easy to walk everywhere.  The bathroom was clean and well kept.  The staff are very friendly and ... Very good Ticks everywhere. Too much over grown grassy area's and there where tons of Ticks. Beautiful park, GREAT staff each year.  Love camping here. Not overcrowded, just right.  Only thing is I would like to see the Ministry keep this park OPEN till Thanksgiving. Great location and great dog beach Spacious lots, great green space by the water Went for day use purposes. Everything seemed neat and well kept. Office staff were friendly and helpful. The beach is very rocky though. The campsites and washrooms were nice and clean and the staff were extremely helpful with any needs. They also offer a ""Learn to Camp"" program that's great for first timers. Great sites. Not much beach. Family loves it here The sites are nice. Just not the greatest beach. Big nice camp grounds Received a phone call to tell us our site was too wet which was fine but they wanted us to drive there to pick another site.

Been going here since I was a child, now I take my own kid there to make her own memories... great way to spend a day!! The beach is beautiful, camp sites are clean, the boat launch is fantastic (although busy, but understandably since it is a good one!) and the store has pretty much everything you need, including some really tasty ice cream!!! Nice place lot of parking. Long beach sandy as well as pebbles. Make sure u take the bbq lots of sunscreen. A tent would be good.  Changing and toilets all around.  Excellent family picnic place. Great camp site, very close to Toronto less than 1 hour. Warm and pleasant water and great sand beach. Totally recommend it We had a great time. I guess the only reason I am not rating it 5 stars has nothing to do with the park itself and that it was just too busy!  First time visitor....we will be back. It's the first time i camp in Canada and i could say it was a wonderful experience, everything is super clean. If you want fresh air for your lungs and you're close to Toronto come here and have a peaceful night and jump into the lake Simcoe. Great spot to swim and SUP paddle board This park is disgusting. It's full of dog poop, stinks and has way to many bugs. (Bugs you will be terrified of and ones you won't find anywhere else) The beach and park area is ok. The area for swimming is way to small and it's crowded, … It was busy on the weekend but not during the week. Comfort stations were clean. Lots of sites are private. Average beach with a nice playground for kids. A great Park to hang out lots of trees cover parking is 20 bucks per car when I was here with a group of five people, the beach is very muddy so buy some swim wear and get a pair of waterproof slippers if your going in the water.
And be early for parking otherwise its jammed up. All time favourite park so far. Very nice beach and plenty to do. Eldon hall is a great place to visit in the park for a look into the past. I will start the review first by saying the staff at this park were extremely pleasant and friendly. They were very enjoyable to engage with and were always waving when passing by. Even when they were cleaning up left over garbage at a … I've been here numerous times for day use or camping. It's good for beginner campers. For a day use of beach close to Toronto it's great although Simcoe doesn't have the best water. The biggest problem with it is lack of showers in the day use area. Beautiful camping.

Pros:
- Not very far from Toronto
- Big campsites
- Fairly big and maintained beach
- Overall good environment
Cons:
- Beach quality is not very good
- Very crowded in weekends, especially during long weekends.

Overall, a good park for camping. Really super busy on weekends because it's so close to Toronto. Lately the day use beaches are filled with inconsiderate mindless people that have no regard for the fact that they ought to share the space with others. 
Otherwise, the beach is pretty good and the park camping is decent. Meh beach. Literally always jam packed. Grounds are clean but just way too many patrons for me. Be prepared to wait for a parking spot and try and snag a picnic table by 8am Amazing sandy beach ! I absolutely love this place but be aware that you need to pay an entry fee!

The trail is not that great. Perfect week, thank you.    A few out of order showers is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, but not complaining. Generally very crowded on the weekends. I think there are much nicer beaches around Lake Simcoe that aren't as popular. Parking is also quite pricey. Good family fun.

The parking area is also unpaved, which will have your car coated in a thick … Wonderful provincial camping park with good facilities, wish there was more hiking.

Good grounds, good facilities. $20 for day visit. No showers but has private change rooms. The Beach is okay for kids to play but the water was full not clear here on that day.

Park has plenty of amenities though, hiking trails, park store and diner, boat launch, museum and more. Lots of green space and group areas as well. We were pleasantly surprised by this park. We had never had any friends mention it or recommend it, so we were skeptical when it was the last site available for the weekend we were going camping. However, when we got there, we discovered it is nicely wooded and quite private. We are going again next month! Can fill up easily and pay for parking/access for the park.

If you want fresh air for your lungs and you're close to Toronto come here and have a peaceful night and jump into the lake Simcoe. Great spot to swim and SUP paddle board This park is disgusting.

Even when they were cleaning up left over garbage at a … I've been here numerous times for day use or camping. It's good for beginner campers. For a day use of beach close to Toronto it's great although Simcoe doesn't have the best water. The biggest problem with it is lack of showers in the day use area. Beautiful camping.

Pros:
- Not very far from Toronto
- Big campsites
- Fairly big and maintained beach
- Overall good environment
Cons:
- Beach quality is not very good
- Very crowded in weekends, especially during long weekends.

Overall, a good park for camping. Really super busy on weekends because it's so close to Toronto. Lately the day use beaches are filled with inconsiderate mindless people that have no regard for the fact that they ought to share the space with others. 
Otherwise, the beach is pretty good and the park camping is decent. Meh beach. Literally always jam packed. Grounds are clean but just way too many patrons for me. Be prepared to wait for a parking spot and try and snag a picnic table by 8am Amazing sandy beach ! I absolutely love this place but be aware that you need to pay an entry fee! I spent 3 nights there. It is a quiet place to spend time with your family and friends out of the city. Its clean, and enjoyable. Don't forget to bring your repellent. Nice camp site on a perfect location
They just don’t explain enough at the entrance so we had to pay double and no refund!! Excellent camp site with a beach nearby. Beach gets crowded with day visitors but still fun. Has electrical and non electrical sites.
The trail is not that great. Perfect week, thank you.    A few out of order showers is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, but not complaining. Generally very crowded on the weekends. I think there are much nicer beaches around Lake Simcoe that aren't as popular. Parking is also quite pricey. Good family fun. Sometimes a bit crowded but that's to be expected being so close to the city. Been coming back for years as it's great to get away without the long drive and on short notice. Clean sites.

This place is beautiful with many beaches and coasts to play on. I definitely recommend you to get a kayak or canoe to explore the shores. We found a nice big rock a little cove and had a blast. 

Went here for the long weekend and I ... We had a lovely weekend enjoying the trails. Walking poles of some sort really helped.

Lovely trail with some great lookouts. Park was clean and had a terrific beach. Mosquitoes are insane on the trail. Dope up! This was my first time hiking and we did the Bonnie's trail which was amazing! For beginners it's a moderate difficulty trail. We saw some bear claws or I thought that's what it was :) the park staff could have been nicer, when I walked ... Nice park, very quiet even with a full campground. Bathrooms relatively clean.

I hardly recommend this place. All things are perfect I've been going to Silent Lake since I was a kid. Beautiful Provincial park with no motorboats. Great fishing, swimming and camping. Really nice, clean camp ground.  We stayed in cabin 208 which is well located and quiet.  Comes with a friendly raccoon 😆.  Shallow sand beach, nice co.fort station with shower and dish washing rooms.  Good canoeing and fishing.  In general a wonderful, fun family experience. This has been a great park every time I've visited. Especially since they remodeled parts of it. The campsites are clean and have distance between them. The comfort stations have always been clean and I've never seen them run out of ... Even though it was long weekend and day use area parking was full, once we launched our kayaks it was all quiet.

Camp sites are great with utmost privacy. Park office is new; great and helpful staff. A must to visit park. Some awesome walk in sites near the campground beach. Nice quiet lake for paddling. Day use beach is nice too. Some good hiking or biking. A lot of the sites lack level tent pads, but most are decently spaced. I liked it here. Bugs can be bad early in the season due to some swampy areas, so be prepared! Amazing experience as always! Beautiful campsites, lots of space between sites (partly because the surrounding area is full of hills and whatnot), but also good tree cover to keep privacy. Many options for campsites and generally a very ... Great park. Had a great time here. It was my first time camping here and I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested. This park is great.

I have been to many provincial parks in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI, and this one really surprised me with how nice the facilities were. The beach is small and beautiful to swim at as well! Great camping for fishing, kayaking and relaxing. Ton's of wild animals and bugs :)  The reason i'm giving this place 3 stars is due to the unclean toilets and comfort stations. One of the comfort stations was closed which created big lineups. This is a great park that is a task of Algonquin on a smaller scale.  The gate house is new with two dumping and three filling stations in the park.  There are three docs to launch boats from and a well organized rental system.  The park ... Silent Lake PP's Lake Trail is a great hike!  Last time I did this hike was ~30 years ago.

Not much privacy and filled with hills and massive rocks. We chose the most recent site because it looked private, after arriving we ... Great place for camping, picnics, swimming or canoeing. Very clean washrooms at least at the entrance. Will camper here next year. We really enjoy camping at silent lake. Had not been here for about 5 years with the kids and really miss the raft in the swimming area. Otherwise this is an awesome place to kids for a geat camping experience. Beautiful, well-maintained park grounds. Very quiet, very serene. The facilities have all been recently renovated and updated, which is a plus. We stayed in one of the newly built cabins and wow! Talk about luxury. Our only complaint was ... Great hiking trails, park itself was really nice, staff were kind. It's relatively quiet, however there was a screaming crying baby the whole time my partner and I were there. .. which made it a not so silent lake.. otherwise it was good. Would go back in the fall when theres less chance if smaller crying children. Small park. Beach though small is close to the entrance. Reasonably priced canoe rentals available. Lake water is calm, so easy to canoe. Yurt rental great beach fabulous semi rough camping BBQ was absolutely filthy so I cleaned it. Ran over pothole on paved road bearly flattened my sedans rear right so had to drive 30 km to get air right away. My point very overstaffed park very lazy staff. Security is a little strict but otherwise nice camp grounds and nature all around.  Can rent canoes and water gear without a hassle. Lovely spacious park.  Quiet as no engines allowed.  Two good beaches and camp sites are quite spacious and not too close together. Good spacing of camp sites. Electrical sites and yurts available. I really like this park. The walk in sites are great. Beach is clean.
What's up with the price of wood? Dudes: you have a monopoly on the market! What gives? Amazing park, would give it more than 5 stars if possible. I stayed in a cabin for four days and it had so many amenities. There was a binder that had information about the park trails, renting canoes etc. The cabin offered a kettle, ... A typical Ontario provincial park; excellent. This park has extra large sites making for a more private feel. We stayed 2 days in a yurt and really enjoyed not having to pack and set up a tent. The beds were comfortable and a bbq was ... Stayed in a cabin, small fridge and microwave. Very clean and close to amenities. Fantastic couple of days. It was amazing experience the hiking was amazing and the lake was really nice. The lake is very silent as the name suggests and its a great place to unwind Great park with clean facilities. I would have given 5 if there weren't too much mosquitoes. But had fun While the park itself is beautiful, the hiking map and trails need to be updated. The maps provided lacked detailed information, there were only a few trail markers as my husband and I hiked along. Having hiked at many provincial parks ... Yes it's worth the trip 
So beautiful and so fun Great place to camp and fun kayaking. The place is very clean and the staff are great Great for winter camping, especially in the new cabins. Cabins comfortably house a family of 4 and are great place for a midwinter break. Heated washrooms and dishwashing facilities at the comfort station are great and there is a good ... The camping park is very family friendly, there are little beaches, canoe rental, short maintained walks, nice toilets and laundry. But not too much on the lines of serious hiking, and not as great views as Algonquin or Bruce. Pristine water for swimming.  No motorized boats. No pollution. Fantastic camp sites, newly upgraded comfort stations; you could go swimming in the warm lake or hike on the trail. Canoe rental is available near the beach. There is coffee available for purchase at the park office. The only thing is ... Loved the beach! Will come back and bring more family. Staff do a great job of keeping bathrooms and the park clean.

It is avery nice provincial park. Lots of activities to do! Scenic and peaceful place. Very calm waters... great for canoeing. Nice and quiet. Cool lake with some islands and swimming remote spots. Tent camping, yurt camping, just hiking, all so so fun.  I went yurt camping in February when the lake was frozen solid and was able to walk out on the ice during the night and gaze up at the stars.  It was such a good trip! Also yurt camping gives unlimited wood supply! Love this place come every year it's always a blast Fantastic park. Very helpful staff. Very clean washrooms. Roomy campsites. Drunk driver who drove around in the park on a sat night. They were loud and made the visit terrible Clean lake, active rangers doing activities with children, and a nice little beach. Definitely a nice little spot to relax. Great for canoeing and for families! The cabins are awesome... Well worth the cost! An amazing place to Camp. The yurt and comfort stations were clean.

Bugs are bad this year so you have to keep moving. Nice distance between sites. I loved canoeing on the lake. The campgrounds facilities are well maintained, but it had a lot of mosquitoes on that particular weekend. Another great provincial park to visit with hiking trails and mountain biking trails and a big lake for canoeing. Nice new facilities too. Amazing park. Even the walk ins are awesome !

Small beach for campers. Prefer other parks. Beautiful quiet place to stop. We stayed for 2 nights in the log cabins. Well equipped with microwave and fridge. We visited on a winter weekend and had an amazing time. Unfortunately mother nature didn't cooperate and we were unable to ski, but we had a great time hiking. Silent lake is a beautiful park and I can't wait to return (hopefully to camp). The new cabins are a great way to get out to the parks in the winter. Clean and quiet, and close to the excellent new comfort stations. Probably much less private in the summer, since they are right beside the day use area. Great facilities, canoe rentals and beautiful views. Family friendly and memorable moments for kids and all. A remote feeling. Beautiful, clean swimming lake. One of the best parks in Ontario! A secret jem. We have been going here for 26 years! Beautiful, serene and clean! Park Warden Jennifer, and the rest of the staff, were incredibly kind and helpful, even calling me a week in advance to make sure things were discussed prior to our arrival.

Gorgeous views. Great park. Everything is perfect. The yurts location is good and they're well maintained. The trails were amazing, a real winter wonderland. A quiet lake. Beautiful campgrounds. Trail that goes around the whole lake love this park... it is in an extremely hilly area tho, so it's not for the faint if heart. serious enthusiasts are best for this park in regard to the trails I have been coming to this Park since 1980.

Had an amazing camping experience Great place! Great for tent camping. The roads in the campground are very hilly and steep which can make driving with a trailer difficult. Sites have a lot of trees and entrances are narrow. Great for tents but hard to back up a trailer. The hiking trails are very nice. Next time I'll be heading back to reserve a hike in site. A tiny, quiet delight. Fabulous camping and hiking. Loved it here! Stunning views! This was literally the WORST experience I have EVER had with a provincial park. We rented a yurt on lot 9 for two nights and when we showed up it was SURROUNDED by little spots of smelly stagnant water(and with an empty propane tank). ...

They will have a much better understanding of the park than the ones in the ... A great park with equally good amenities. Perfect for winter glamping, with a good amount of activities. Place is beautiful.

Lovely park with good facilities. The hiking trail along the lakeshore is fun. Didn't try the mountain bike trail, but just pedaling around was exhausting because this park is so hilly.

Bugs can be bad early in the season due to some swampy areas, so be prepared! Amazing experience as always!

I have been to many provincial parks in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI, and this one really surprised me with how nice the facilities were. The beach is small and beautiful to swim at as well! Great camping for fishing, kayaking and relaxing. Ton's of wild animals and bugs :)  The reason i'm giving this place 3 stars is due to the unclean toilets and comfort stations. One of the comfort stations was closed which created big lineups.

There are three docs to launch boats from and a well organized rental system.  The park ... Silent Lake PP's Lake Trail is a great hike!  Last time I did this hike was ~30 years ago.

It's relatively quiet, however there was a screaming crying baby the whole time my partner and I were there. .. which made it a not so silent lake.. otherwise it was good. Would go back in the fall when theres less chance if smaller crying children. Small park. Beach though small is close to the entrance. Reasonably priced canoe rentals available. Lake water is calm, so easy to canoe. Yurt rental great beach fabulous semi rough camping BBQ was absolutely filthy so I cleaned it. Ran over pothole on paved road bearly flattened my sedans rear right so had to drive 30 km to get air right away. My point very overstaffed park very lazy staff.

It was amazing experience the hiking was amazing and the lake was really nice. The lake is very silent as the name suggests and its a great place to unwind Great park with clean facilities. I would have given 5 if there weren't too much mosquitoes. But had fun While the park itself is beautiful, the hiking map and trails need to be updated. The maps provided lacked detailed information, there were only a few trail markers as my husband and I hiked along. Having hiked at many provincial parks ... Yes it's worth the trip 
So beautiful and so fun Great place to camp and fun kayaking. The place is very clean and the staff are great Great for winter camping, especially in the new cabins.

Silent lake is a beautiful park and I can't wait to return (hopefully to camp). The new cabins are a great way to get out to the parks in the winter. Clean and quiet, and close to the excellent new comfort stations. Probably much less private in the summer, since they are right beside the day use area. Great facilities, canoe rentals and beautiful views. Family friendly and memorable moments for kids and all. A remote feeling. Beautiful, clean swimming lake. One of the best parks in Ontario! A secret jem. We have been going here for 26 years! Beautiful, serene and clean!

The campsites are a little closer to each other. Nice beach. Great place for a swim. Lots of kids though. Very nice place, lake is beautiful and great for a canoe ride, not much more then sun fish if you're fishing but still a good place to camp, good staff. Silver lake is a very good park, they even have a rest point on HWY 7 ,every time I drive between Toronto and Ottawa, I take a break here, the water is clear and warm in summer, very good for swimming or paddling. The park was not crowded, and the weather was nice. It is good that you pay only for your car and not for the number of people coming when you enter the park. Great camping for families - only an hour or so outside of Ottawa. Great for day trips too. Great place to hang out with the family and enjoy the beach. Lots to do, good swimming. Campsites are nice. Close to the highway though, so you can hear and see many cars driving at night. Nice lake park is kept clean very small in size. I wouldn't plan on going if your a large party or have older kids absolute nothing to do. 
Parks police made there round at 10pm was told to turn music down so I shut it off. The people ... Great place to get away with the family.  Been coming to Silver Lake for over 20 years.

Clean comfort stations. Don't actually go to park. Go to 1st nation smoke shop across hwy. Big discounts on cigarettes but cash only. Stopped for lunch.  Very clean.
Only lacking was no family/disabled washroom.  My husband is blind therefore accompanied him to ladies washroom and somebody watched the door. Had a great time so beautiful Soo camping beside a busy highway isn't my thing.
But if your into car camping and modern amenities.
Seemed to be alot of Canada ""new comers"" trying out camping here too.
Washrooms were a mess at times. Wonderful small park if you're interested in a day trip. But if you're looking for a good camping trip, you should probably skip silver lake because it has a lack of wildlife. Overall a nice place for a swim and BBQ. Lots of the white stuff snow Love this little park. Very family focused. Nice beach, nice playground, good facilities. Limited privacy, typical of car camping sites.  Nice place as long as you get a site on the back campground.   The front campground is 3 meters or so from the highway and you hear every car that passes. Beautiful campground Worst campground I have ever been to. 1 star for friendly staff, the only nice thing I can say about it.

The bad:
-My campsite was like 50 ft from the highway which was ripe with motorcycles.
-My site was also infested with cockroaches. ... Have camped here a few times now, over a span of about 10 years. Camp sites are nicely wooded, situated on a rolling hillside. Some sites are closer to the highway than some would like, but we don't spend much time at the campsite ... Was too dark and late to stop Great little beaches and area for camping. It's a nice day trip to a modest but pleasant park. The views are typical of lakeside cottage country with a fairly nice swimming beach. Nice little campground with a great beach on a warm lake. Some drawbacks for me are that his park is very close to Highway 7 so you do hear traffic all day and night, and the camp site's are close together with little to no trees in between so there is not much privacy. A good place for picnic or family get together.  Beach is clean. Friendly staff to keep lake Park area clean.  Very nice shallow beach for kids. After Sept 10 the gate is closed and it is a bit of a walk in to the beach with kids plus beach gear but it is so worth it. The walk in enterance is not wide enough for a large stroller. Early on a ... Fun place to camp and fish. Ok park Clean, well maintained, good prices Beautiful but bad Caterpillar weekend. Site 135 is primo!
Most private site I have ever had in a car camping Provincial Park camp site.  Excellent provincial park Beautiful park with some great sites right on the water. Very nice campsite with a beach and a place where you could fish. The bathrooms are indoors, which is nice and they also offer snacks at the main building, though they're quite pricy.  Family tradition to visit this lake every sunday during summer break. MANY great memories during our lovely picnics. 

I also love the cool rocks you can find near campgrounds!  Beautiful park Loved the service, wardens were super helpful as I'm disabled.  Hope Jowell is on duty! Beautiful clean park but can here the Queensway noise at night when your trying to sleep Clean bathrooms. Friendly staff. Amazing views.  Great Park very few bugs and the staff very friendly and helpful. This camping is perfect for weekend gateway or a day on the beach. There are not that many trails for hiking if any, however the park is still nice to walk around and has great areas for a picknick. As usual for Ontario Provincial Parks you can rent a canoe and explore the lake. Don't forget the mosquito repellent. I will gave it a 10 We had the most horrible experience at Silver Lake over the weekend.

Clean friendly staff. Nice clean beach. We'll be coming back for years!!!  Great beach for kids, gradual grade in the swimming area and plenty of sand to play in.

Fun park Very nice park, staff was friendly.

Barking dogs at night but great staff Nice little provincial park with good amenities.   Not a good place to camp! Terrible experience, no privacy, it is like being in the city!

Beautiful scenery, lots of nice birds  Love the lake side tent camping!  Great place to see Great park Great place to camp Passed by this lake beautiful!

I'm not saying it's not great, but let's say I was unlucky. The place is also rather family ... (Translated by Google) Very leafy and green

-My site was also infested with cockroaches. ... Have camped here a few times now, over a span of about 10 years. Camp sites are nicely wooded, situated on a rolling hillside. Some sites are closer to the highway than some would like, but we don't spend much time at the campsite ... Was too dark and late to stop Great little beaches and area for camping. It's a nice day trip to a modest but pleasant park. The views are typical of lakeside cottage country with a fairly nice swimming beach. Nice little campground with a great beach on a warm lake. Some drawbacks for me are that his park is very close to Highway 7 so you do hear traffic all day and night, and the camp site's are close together with little to no trees in between so there is not much privacy. A good place for picnic or family get together.  Beach is clean. Friendly staff to keep lake Park area clean.  Very nice shallow beach for kids. After Sept 10 the gate is closed and it is a bit of a walk in to the beach with kids plus beach gear but it is so worth it. The walk in enterance is not wide enough for a large stroller. Early on a ... Fun place to camp and fish. Ok park Clean, well maintained, good prices Beautiful but bad Caterpillar weekend. Site 135 is primo!
Most private site I have ever had in a car camping Provincial Park camp site.  Excellent provincial park Beautiful park with some great sites right on the water. Very nice campsite with a beach and a place where you could fish. The bathrooms are indoors, which is nice and they also offer snacks at the main building, though they're quite pricy.  Family tradition to visit this lake every sunday during summer break. MANY great memories during our lovely picnics. 

I also love the cool rocks you can find near campgrounds!  Beautiful park Loved the service, wardens were super helpful as I'm disabled.  Hope Jowell is on duty! Beautiful clean park but can here the Queensway noise at night when your trying to sleep Clean bathrooms. Friendly staff. Amazing views.  Great Park very few bugs and the staff very friendly and helpful. This camping is perfect for weekend gateway or a day on the beach. There are not that many trails for hiking if any, however the park is still nice to walk around and has great areas for a picknick. As usual for Ontario Provincial Parks you can rent a canoe and explore the lake. Don't forget the mosquito repellent. I will gave it a 10 We had the most horrible experience at Silver Lake over the weekend. On day 2 of our weekend, we decided to head over to the beach area to have a BBQ and enjoy the beautiful weather. We brought 2 Palm Bays and 2 Beers with us. Some of ... Very nice place to chill and to have a picnic Lovely shallow lake... Warms up fast Gorgeous lake A Nice place for canoeing, camping. Well maintenant.  great spot family A great park and staff! Clean facilities and nicely treed private camp sites. A cosy smaller park, not in the middle of the wilderness but that is obvious if you do your research in advance.  Third year here! Clean friendly staff. Nice clean beach. We'll be coming back for years!!!  Great beach for kids, gradual grade in the swimming area and plenty of sand to play in. The camping area itself is quite tightly packed (at least the sites with electricity), but nicely treed. beautiful little park not tooo far from Ottawa on a shallow warm lake graet for swimming and fishing. Fun park Very nice park, staff was friendly.  Beautiful smaller provincial park right on Hwy 7 - loses a star because a lot of the campsites back onto the highway, and it is quite loud when semi trucks and motorcycles are driving by. Nice hiking trails, good beaches. Lots to do. ... The sites are very close together and too close to the highway. Also, the wood at the store was all wet. Nice beach.  You can swim across the bay from the beach which is nice Beautiful camp ground and facilities will come back again. One of the best places to go camping it's so beautiful and the water is clean Fun spot for a camping getaway. Bring bug spray. Barking dogs at night but great staff Nice little provincial park with good amenities.   Not a good place to camp! Terrible experience, no privacy, it is like being in the city! The sites are directly beside eachother... if you're looking for a real camping experience this place is far from it! Also, a lot of the campground ... Beautiful scenery, lots of nice birds  Love the lake side tent camping!  Great place to see Great park Great place to camp Passed by this lake beautiful!  (Translated by Google) I had several ticks on my dog and one on me. The campsite was infested with caterpillars and there was suffocating heat. I'm not saying it's not great, but let's say I was unlucky. The place is also rather family ... (Translated by Google) Very leafy and green

There is 10 hot shower area with washer/dryer however washing machine cost $3 and dryer cost $2. Fire woods $8/bag. Everyone is so friendly. The views are great. Great spot to fish ... Nice clean and QUIET park as far as other campers are concerned. 
It is quite close to the highway, so there is noise from there, but if you bring earplugs it's fine for sleeping.
They're building/renovating a second comfort station, so ... Awesome lake full of fishing and clear waters. Caught a few great fish and really enjoyed the scenery of the park. Easy access to boat ramp. Beautiful National Park! I’ve done 4 separate long weekends at the park wit some great friends and absolutely loved every minute! The beach is borderline not a beach... but the waters for fishing or boating are perfect. We have also done ... Nice provincial park. It's a dog friendly park. Nice sized camp spots. Few small swimming beaches.  Docks available to rent, if you bring your boat. Obviously there is a boat launch. Fishing can be good for pike, bass, perch and sunfish ... Very nice spot we went to by default with the forest fires up north, but turned out good.  Need more accessible amenities by foot.  Didn't like hearing the 400 traffic noise though. Very noticeable It's a small conservation park. Lot's of rocks and a small beach. The park was not properly maintained when we went during camping.  The washrooms were not cleaned untill after 10am.  No paper toilets and mess all over.  A big line up to ... This park is more of a conservation area than a provincial park.  Only two serviced washrooms were available, but they had 6 showers.  There's always a huge line up to use it.  The noise from the highway is pretty loud, the beach that ... There was a bear on the grounds, which means it’s probably host to many people from the city who are inexperienced campers who leave garbage around.

Camp sites are decent size and okay for privacy. Bugs were a little annoying. Actually had tick issues. Park was very entertaining for kids a variety of ages. Has a separate beach for dogs.

Also, it would be nice if they could fence off the area so ... A great campsite for young kids. The beach and playground were excellent and provided days worth of fun. Our sites had good privacy and the camp offered tones of free fishing lessons and supplies. We would definitely bring our kids back. 5 days camping with family and such a good time.  Very nice provincial park with a few nice beaches and play ground.  Lots to do on the water. six mile is a smaller quieter park. even on long weekends it's not packed which is why I rather drive an extra 30 min.
off leash dog beach. you can rent kayaks etc.$25/2hrs
water is nice and warm great for kids We had truck troubles when we arrived, the staff were fantastic, very courteous and helpful. Thank's again for your understanding and support. 
We still managed to enjoy the park and will be back again soon!
To the all the staff at 6 Mile Lake provincial park, our sincere thanks! HONESTLY IF I WANTED TO GO SOMEPLACE QUIET I WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE LIBRARY.  HONESTLY THIS CAMP SITE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEEP AT 9:30. WASTE OF MY 2 HOUR DRIVE AND FOOD THAT WE COULDNT BBQ BECAUSE OF THE FIRE BAN WHICH IS REALLY STUPID...LEFT WITHIN 2 HOURS OF MY STAY. Great place. Nice beach areas and playground. Would totally go back. Kids had a blast. Make sure to check the pictures of the sites as a lot of them have massive rocks so it made it difficult to put the pegs for the tent. Also, atm one of the comfort stations is under Reno's but it's looking very good. It is a nice park with access to nice water ways. The best thing is you can get a reserve a boat slip so you don't have to pull the boat in and out every time you use it but there is only so many and first come first serve so get there early. Love this place.  Great location and family fun!
A little mucky at the bottom of the lake when swimming at the campsite, but the beach site is great! 
We will be back many times this year! Nice park. Too close too hwy. Stay away from this park in 2018. 

We were six individual in a family who went there on the Canada day 2018 long weekend to stay there for three nights. But it turned out to be a bad experience and we left after two nights. 
There are ... One of the best parks I've ever been to! So many things to do there! Nice park but at times you can hear Hwy 400 in the background. Lots of park rangers around keeping it peaceful and people in line with booze off site and dogs off the people beaches! Perfect place for summer vacation... love it 😍 
Precious memories.... Awesome time. Excellent camping experience This park is beautiful and relatively close to the Windsor area. Great alternative to cheap a hotel while heading to the city. Fire wood is expensive and wet! Camping site at Lakeview height is terrible. Washroom and garbage site are far. Showed up to launch the boat for a day of fishing before the staff arrived and when we go get the truck at the end of the day they gave us a $30 parking ticket for not showing a permit? HELLO! THERE WAS NO ONE TO ISSUE THE PERMIT FOR THE ... Great for families with children. Mother Nature offers a variety of different things that only nature can offer. Enjoy the outdoors, and teach the children a new world of interesting facts about nature as a whole. There are campsites, beaches, clean and well maintained bathrooms. The prices are nice, and there are plenty of sites around the year. The beaches are quite nice, and offer free mooring. There is an abundance of fish nearby, despite the ... Not so impressed by this. Not worth the drive from Toronto. Limited amenities. May be good for people from Berry as its near. Nothing more to do than canoeing in a small cordoned area few square feet wide. I've had some amazing time at this park. This park is not large enough for trailers. Very difficult to get trailer into and out of site. Our site #36 was at the bottom of a hill and during a rain storm the site was totally flooded. One very busy main road that was very narrow. Not impressed with this park at all. Will not return Great family place to camp.  N now hav a bunch of brand new showers in a huge building.    Thats gonna be nice.  But not quite done yet.   But sure looks like it. Always good to go, there is something to do for every age. 
Great experience, sometimes the day area is to crowd. I will never go back to this PP again. 

We took our family of 6 to site 129 as it was right across from the 'Comfort Station'. When we arrived we we're asked if we picked the site for that reason (we have 4 kids) and when we said ""yes"" ... Awesome campground. Lot to do. 2 beaches. Conroe, kayak and paddle boat rentals. Great hiking trail that go around the park. Great place to camp. Bathrooms and showers very clean! Excellent customer service. great place to visit, even for a day trip, super relaxing. Definitely one of my favorite provincial parks. Great spot for exploring in a canoe. The park is decent. We had a great site, but i can see people being disappointed if they were in a different site. There are water access sites but they are small and right on the main roadway - so small that people were parling their ... Great Beach, plenty of canoes and paddleboards and kayaks for rental, clean facilities and the learn to fish program is excellent! We had just went here to get a camp site for 2 nights. We paid and went to our site. Got to our site and it was a mess. There was garbage all over. The fire pit was full of garbage and there was a used condom  by the picnic table. This ... Great park! Was very happy to spend the weekend exploring. Can't believe we waited this long to go here. Feels like Muskoka.  A little close to Hiway 400 but very nice Beautiful place, lots of activities and fun. Swimming, kayaking, canoeing, biking, fishing, camping, birds watching! Had a great time walking the Milne trail and picnicking.  Of course, it helped that the weather co-operated. Nice park. Close to Toronto.  A lot of noise the first night (4am) and the park officials did not address the noise the second night until 1am.  Plenty....I mean PLENTY of signs about not disturbing the peace but not much in the way of ... Beautiful camp site
Quiet 
Facilities clearly labelled 
Seems to be well maintained Trails are awesome...swamps are full of life...had the best site in the park Beautiful  park perfect for bringing your kids too sites are nice and clean Nice place to stop on route: dog beach is a plus! I enjoyed my waterfront site because we could sunbath on a large rock at the waterfront. The site was small but made up for by basically having our own private beach. This also offered convenient access for our canoe. The site was ... The sites are fairly spaced apart and are natural enough to feel like you're camping in the woods.  The lake is good and plenty big enough for boating and fishing.  Lake is clean and good for swimming.  The facilities are fairly clean ... Small beautiful provincial park! Literally did not see a single mosquito the whole 3 days!! Had an amazing time.  Clean and well looked after park. Wow, what a beautiful park! It's a perfect size to traverse by bicycle and has tons to do. We camped beside the walking trail, which was quite a challenge with the rocky and uneven terrain but also provided some incredible views of ... Nice location but the robo cop kids in there bulletproof vest are brutal you can't talk around a fire at night around 930 they start coming around and start jocking you about talking saying your being to load but at 630am kids can run ... Campsites nice however so close to Trans Canada there is a drone of road noise everywhere we walked. Trails very poorly marked or blazed. Several places we had several possibilities from a clearing but no discernible route. Need better ... A beautiful camp ground with excellent beach, a separate dedicated pet beach to unleash your pets and let them play. Beautiful lake with motorboat, kayaking, canoe, paddle boats and paddle kayaks renting options. Place is a safer camping ... Great beach/park for kids, beautiful hiking. Epic!!! Awesome place with great access for boats. not worth to go. lousy camp site. Beautiful weather. Great Father's day weekend Favourite lake to fish in. Great scenery and constant action. The only issue was the bugs and the unit steep climb for the lakeside campsites to return to the main path and get to the washrooms. 

We rented a canoe and paddled it with our bags to our campsite, I think I personally spent more hours ... A nice campground with great (and clean!) facilities. 
The hiking trails skirting the park and going through the woods/marsh was a nice diversion for a couple hours, and the lake was warm, albeit shallow. 
My only gripe is directed at ... Nice cottagers. Best on Ontario Poor comfort stations, more showers than bathrooms. Good place but :  campgrounds are too close to each other;  also, security guards never enforce quiet times in the night even in the radio free sites and therefore so many people every night are being loud way after midnight and the ... Beautiful place, great hiking, lovely beaches! Very clean, park staff are friendly and helpful. Excellent sites. Only issue is the 400 is close and quite loud. You can hear the traffic 24/7 from the whole park. Other than that, great experience. Went there to hike. Forgot to put on bug repellent. The mosquitoes there were TERRIFYING. Dozens of mosquitoes were constantly following me throughout the hike. We visited in the winter, while it is closed, for some cross country skiing. Made our own trails and used the snowmobile trails. Cold, hardwork and absolutely gorgeous! We had an amazing time camping in this beautiful park! This is a nice park with a large lake that allows for hours of exploration by canoe or kayak. There are some extremely nice camp sites, including some lake front sites. The down side of this park is not the park staff or warden's fault. ... I've live at Six Mile and have knon the park before it became a park. Well organized and very picturesque. So much to do and easy access. Great boating fishing aand swimming.Love the area. I hear this was a terrific place for a family camping outing A great spot except.for the noise. The campsites are near highway 400. The staff make a lot of noise with the beach grooming equipment starting at 7:15 am. There is currently heavy construction in one campground. Two people beaches and ... Good spot for family camping close to water Love this place. Some great camp sites but way too busy during the summer. Great park, but the noise coming off hwy 400 is really bad. I went kayaking out onto the lake and I could still hear the hwy. The hwy itself does not have any sound barriers. As far as sound goes I'd rate this park a 1 out of 5. The lake ... Loved our visit nice staff and great weather I went there late in September. Well-maintained, and beautiful place. Perfect for camping. At the time I was there it was really quiet. Could be crowded during summer time especially on weekends. it's a good camping spot for families.. Great spot, small sites. Nice trail. My dog enjoyed the beach here! Decent park, good campsites, and very accessible from the highway... but a bit too close! You can hear the hum of hwy 400 traffic from everywhere in the park. The beaches also weren't very great. Great place to hike and Kayak Nice park with great beaches and lots of boat slips available, a new comfort station and a good general store We go here every year. Spent one night here on one of the walk-in sites (#19). We didn't get to see too much of the park, but the parts we did see were quite nice. The boat dock area is great, and we actually managed to catch a couple small pike right there. ... The only problem with Six Mile Lake is that eventually we'll have to leave and we can't take it with us. good place to fishing and family camping.  But lack of modern washrooms(?) and shower booth.   Most of toilets are Vault toilets.   Just 2 toilets are  the flush toilet. Great park minis provincial park officers. They're  rude and tend to pick on groups with visible  minorities.  Would  not come back to this park.  Officer Catelin Diver constantly  picked on our group.  I question her credibility  and her ability  as an office.  Complete abusive  of power. Nice place Nice canoeing spot Some really nice spots if tent camping. Limited nice sites for trailer camping. Very nice trails.  Beautiful place for relaxation. Some noise from hwy 400. Canoeing was very peaceful Hard to find a private site that's big, but everything is beautiful. Hiking trails were easy and the kids enjoyed them. Beautiful park with lots of wildlife! Great beach and nice campsites Great location. Water is warm for swimming. Canoe and kayaking rentals.  Soon will have 2nd shower/ comfort station. This park and lake are one of the nicest provincial parks in ontario. Never camped but the boat launch is fantastic. Parking for boats is pretty far away from the launch Gorgeous Park and campgrounds. Camp sites are small, but park is clean and well maintained. Make sure you get a site close to the lake, I think it's unserviced though... Small park adjacent to a very noisy Hwy400 is almost entirely occupied by the campgrounds. The few short hiking trails are getting very close to the campsites at times, making the stroll a little bit awkward as if you were walking ... Lovely small park.  Can hear noise from highway in some locations. Great park.staff at the gate were very helpful,as our site was not ready....the rangers were great .thanks Ryan . you must visit... Happy camping Nice little park. The lake is big enough to use medium size fishing boats and recreational crafts like kayaks.  Highway 400 noise is constant, day and night. Awesome place to fish! Park is small, but nice. Only downside to mention is the bathroom situation. There's literally only two stalls for the entire park. There is an out house available if needed. Two boat launch docks with available parking. We got mostly for day use Amazing park for camping A great park, with great campsites and a lake that’s pretty nice. I’ve been here a few times and plan to come back again soon. Good provincial park. Paid around C$15 for day entry. We'll serviced place. Beautiful park with plenty of activities for the kids (both big and small).  The staff is incredibly friendly and ready to help out should you require assistance.

We had a blast at the park and will be returning next season. Good mix of stuff to do at the park. Our site was a not at all as rated online through provincial parks booking system Scenery was beautiful, staff friendly.  A great place to relax and enjoy nature Decent sites Beautiful place and nice hiking trails. Definitely would go back!  One of nicer parks in Ontario, great for canoeing Great park for camping and canoeing Nice park. LOTS of sites makes it a little congested. Especially during the summer. It was a lovely campsite with lots to do and variety of facility.
I visited during the civil day long weekend and the camp grounds were packed (only dropped by for day visit). Went for a 2 hrs hike, chilled on the beach and rented a ... Nice beach. Pretty good campsites. But that persistent rumble from the 400 gets frustrating.  Park was clean, staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. Was mostly quiet while we were there, but watch out which site you choose as the 400 is only a few hundred meters away. 

We were originally in a 3## lot, and could see traffic ... Nice clean campsites, showers are great,  park rangers are awesome and very helpful. The place is definitely beautiful and the lake is picturesque (though a bit shallow for enjoyable swimming), and would probably be great for small kids. But don't expect good (long) hikes... The only tail there is quite short, unless you wander outside the park on snowmobile trails. Best place Great beach, good canoeing places and lots more My family comes here every year for the past 6 years or so on civic long weekend and we have never had any issues what so ever.  It's a great place to swim, hike,  and be outdoors.   Beautiful lake, lots of kayaks and canoes to rent, great staff ! (Better row quick to avoid the bugs) The park is OK, but the sounds of traffic from the nearby highway bring it down a bit. The lake is gorgeous though. Beautiful and relaxing Clean facilities. The site was kept clean, and the Park staff were all friendly.   park provide so many activities. Great spot for first time fishing.  Great beach, camping site nice and clean, lots of washrooms in close proximity, family friendly area Great place for kid Have been enjoying this park since I was little, staff is great and organize many activities for visitors. Lake is also decent in size over fished and rocks could be marked better but there are lots of great areas for water-skiing.  Great scenery and campsites! The water is beautiful and the fishing is decent. Washrooms are cleaner than I would have expected. Be sure to check the campsite nap before you book, as some sites can have neighbours very close by. The lake is amazing once you get out on it. Staff are friendly. The campsites are hit-or-miss; make sure you check the pictures online so you know what you are getting into. They have a nice trail but it's only 20-30 minutes --- great ... Small park, with about 3km of nice trails. Very close to a heavy traffic  hwy though; camping may not be a good experience . Great location, wish there were more comfort stations with showers  Great layout, clean sites and facilities,  just a bit cramped closer to main road Great camping spot Very relaxing Nice campground but sites were a little too close together Loved it! No children's programming anymore.  Nature center closed.  Canoe rentals are $60/day Great park, quiet, good swimming and fishing, very busy on holiday's Great place to camp. Clean beach. Large lake and canoe rental available. Great place to hide from city noise. Fresh air worked nicely, haven't slept so well in months. :) Great vacation place. Sandy beaches. Large wooded camp sites. Flush toilets. Fire pit and 2 picnic tables per site. Pets available. Open areas for playing field games. Parks area for children. Hiking trails. A popular park but relatively less busy than some of the provincial parks. ProTip: get a camping spot right on the lake for a great experience. Otherwise, ask for a more private spot further in the park. It was fun... would like to visit again and again and again... :) but few -ve points are... lots of mosquitoes, many camp sites are very close to each other and mostly all camp sites are on the road side. When you book camp site make ... Beautiful place. The camping sites are quite crowded, and the beaches are small for weekend occupancy. Nice Marsh hiking trails!  Beautiful places! This park is beautiful, the staff are happy, helpful and wonderful people. Its a great choice for camping or day use! The campsites are fairly small and very close to the road that the other campers have to drive by on. That means less privacy and the cars constantly kick up dust into the campground.
The bathrooms were awful. They did not flush like the ... Great Nature experience lots of open water for fun activities. People and animals are super friendly.

The views are great. Great spot to fish ... Nice clean and QUIET park as far as other campers are concerned. 
It is quite close to the highway, so there is noise from there, but if you bring earplugs it's fine for sleeping.
They're building/renovating a second comfort station, so ... Awesome lake full of fishing and clear waters. Caught a few great fish and really enjoyed the scenery of the park. Easy access to boat ramp. Beautiful National Park! I’ve done 4 separate long weekends at the park wit some great friends and absolutely loved every minute! The beach is borderline not a beach... but the waters for fishing or boating are perfect. We have also done ... Nice provincial park. It's a dog friendly park. Nice sized camp spots. Few small swimming beaches.  Docks available to rent, if you bring your boat. Obviously there is a boat launch. Fishing can be good for pike, bass, perch and sunfish ... Very nice spot we went to by default with the forest fires up north, but turned out good.  Need more accessible amenities by foot.  Didn't like hearing the 400 traffic noise though. Very noticeable It's a small conservation park. Lot's of rocks and a small beach. The park was not properly maintained when we went during camping.  The washrooms were not cleaned untill after 10am.  No paper toilets and mess all over.  A big line up to ... This park is more of a conservation area than a provincial park.  Only two serviced washrooms were available, but they had 6 showers.  There's always a huge line up to use it.  The noise from the highway is pretty loud, the beach that ... There was a bear on the grounds, which means it’s probably host to many people from the city who are inexperienced campers who leave garbage around. We visited in the off season, so it was fairly quiet but sites are very picked over and ... Nice place. Well maintained. Washrooms pretty clean. Nice variety of products at the store. Camp sites are decent size and okay for privacy. Bugs were a little annoying. Actually had tick issues. Park was very entertaining for kids a variety of ages. Has a separate beach for dogs.

The court is pretty good, albeit a bit small, ... We go minimum once a year. We are dog owners and love the pet beach. The park is clean, brand new comfort station just opened while we where there this year. Very nice. Learn to fish program FREE! SUP canoe paddle boats. Boat launch and ... Great place to camp.

Also, it would be nice if they could fence off the area so ... A great campsite for young kids. The beach and playground were excellent and provided days worth of fun. Our sites had good privacy and the camp offered tones of free fishing lessons and supplies. We would definitely bring our kids back. 5 days camping with family and such a good time.  Very nice provincial park with a few nice beaches and play ground.  Lots to do on the water. six mile is a smaller quieter park. even on long weekends it's not packed which is why I rather drive an extra 30 min.
off leash dog beach. you can rent kayaks etc.$25/2hrs
water is nice and warm great for kids We had truck troubles when we arrived, the staff were fantastic, very courteous and helpful. Thank's again for your understanding and support. 
We still managed to enjoy the park and will be back again soon!
To the all the staff at 6 Mile Lake provincial park, our sincere thanks! HONESTLY IF I WANTED TO GO SOMEPLACE QUIET I WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE LIBRARY.  HONESTLY THIS CAMP SITE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEEP AT 9:30. WASTE OF MY 2 HOUR DRIVE AND FOOD THAT WE COULDNT BBQ BECAUSE OF THE FIRE BAN WHICH IS REALLY STUPID...LEFT WITHIN 2 HOURS OF MY STAY. Great place. Nice beach areas and playground. Would totally go back. Kids had a blast. Make sure to check the pictures of the sites as a lot of them have massive rocks so it made it difficult to put the pegs for the tent. Also, atm one of the comfort stations is under Reno's but it's looking very good. It is a nice park with access to nice water ways. The best thing is you can get a reserve a boat slip so you don't have to pull the boat in and out every time you use it but there is only so many and first come first serve so get there early. Love this place.  Great location and family fun!
A little mucky at the bottom of the lake when swimming at the campsite, but the beach site is great! 
We will be back many times this year! Nice park. Too close too hwy. Stay away from this park in 2018. 

We were six individual in a family who went there on the Canada day 2018 long weekend to stay there for three nights. But it turned out to be a bad experience and we left after two nights. 
There are ... One of the best parks I've ever been to! So many things to do there! Nice park but at times you can hear Hwy 400 in the background. Lots of park rangers around keeping it peaceful and people in line with booze off site and dogs off the people beaches! Perfect place for summer vacation... love it 😍 
Precious memories.... Awesome time. Excellent camping experience This park is beautiful and relatively close to the Windsor area. Great alternative to cheap a hotel while heading to the city. Fire wood is expensive and wet! Camping site at Lakeview height is terrible. Washroom and garbage site are far. Showed up to launch the boat for a day of fishing before the staff arrived and when we go get the truck at the end of the day they gave us a $30 parking ticket for not showing a permit? HELLO! THERE WAS NO ONE TO ISSUE THE PERMIT FOR THE ... Great for families with children. Mother Nature offers a variety of different things that only nature can offer. Enjoy the outdoors, and teach the children a new world of interesting facts about nature as a whole. There are campsites, beaches, clean and well maintained bathrooms. The prices are nice, and there are plenty of sites around the year. The beaches are quite nice, and offer free mooring. There is an abundance of fish nearby, despite the ... Not so impressed by this. Not worth the drive from Toronto. Limited amenities. May be good for people from Berry as its near. Nothing more to do than canoeing in a small cordoned area few square feet wide. I've had some amazing time at this park. This park is not large enough for trailers. Very difficult to get trailer into and out of site. Our site #36 was at the bottom of a hill and during a rain storm the site was totally flooded. One very busy main road that was very narrow. Not impressed with this park at all. Will not return Great family place to camp.  N now hav a bunch of brand new showers in a huge building.    Thats gonna be nice.  But not quite done yet.   But sure looks like it. Always good to go, there is something to do for every age. 
Great experience, sometimes the day area is to crowd. I will never go back to this PP again. 

We took our family of 6 to site 129 as it was right across from the 'Comfort Station'. When we arrived we we're asked if we picked the site for that reason (we have 4 kids) and when we said ""yes"" ... Awesome campground. Lot to do. 2 beaches. Conroe, kayak and paddle boat rentals. Great hiking trail that go around the park. Great place to camp. Bathrooms and showers very clean! Excellent customer service. great place to visit, even for a day trip, super relaxing. Definitely one of my favorite provincial parks. Great spot for exploring in a canoe. The park is decent. We had a great site, but i can see people being disappointed if they were in a different site. There are water access sites but they are small and right on the main roadway - so small that people were parling their ... Great Beach, plenty of canoes and paddleboards and kayaks for rental, clean facilities and the learn to fish program is excellent! We had just went here to get a camp site for 2 nights. We paid and went to our site. Got to our site and it was a mess. There was garbage all over. The fire pit was full of garbage and there was a used condom  by the picnic table. This ... Great park! Was very happy to spend the weekend exploring. Can't believe we waited this long to go here. Feels like Muskoka.  A little close to Hiway 400 but very nice Beautiful place, lots of activities and fun. Swimming, kayaking, canoeing, biking, fishing, camping, birds watching! Had a great time walking the Milne trail and picnicking.  Of course, it helped that the weather co-operated. Nice park. Close to Toronto.  A lot of noise the first night (4am) and the park officials did not address the noise the second night until 1am.  Plenty....I mean PLENTY of signs about not disturbing the peace but not much in the way of ... Beautiful camp site
Quiet 
Facilities clearly labelled 
Seems to be well maintained Trails are awesome...swamps are full of life...had the best site in the park Beautiful  park perfect for bringing your kids too sites are nice and clean Nice place to stop on route: dog beach is a plus! I enjoyed my waterfront site because we could sunbath on a large rock at the waterfront. The site was small but made up for by basically having our own private beach. This also offered convenient access for our canoe. The site was ... The sites are fairly spaced apart and are natural enough to feel like you're camping in the woods.  The lake is good and plenty big enough for boating and fishing.  Lake is clean and good for swimming.  The facilities are fairly clean ... Small beautiful provincial park! Literally did not see a single mosquito the whole 3 days!! Had an amazing time.  Clean and well looked after park. Wow, what a beautiful park! It's a perfect size to traverse by bicycle and has tons to do. We camped beside the walking trail, which was quite a challenge with the rocky and uneven terrain but also provided some incredible views of ... Nice location but the robo cop kids in there bulletproof vest are brutal you can't talk around a fire at night around 930 they start coming around and start jocking you about talking saying your being to load but at 630am kids can run ... Campsites nice however so close to Trans Canada there is a drone of road noise everywhere we walked. Trails very poorly marked or blazed. Several places we had several possibilities from a clearing but no discernible route. Need better ... A beautiful camp ground with excellent beach, a separate dedicated pet beach to unleash your pets and let them play. Beautiful lake with motorboat, kayaking, canoe, paddle boats and paddle kayaks renting options. Place is a safer camping ... Great beach/park for kids, beautiful hiking. Epic!!! Awesome place with great access for boats. not worth to go. lousy camp site. Beautiful weather. Great Father's day weekend Favourite lake to fish in. Great scenery and constant action. The only issue was the bugs and the unit steep climb for the lakeside campsites to return to the main path and get to the washrooms. 

We rented a canoe and paddled it with our bags to our campsite, I think I personally spent more hours ... A nice campground with great (and clean!) facilities. 
The hiking trails skirting the park and going through the woods/marsh was a nice diversion for a couple hours, and the lake was warm, albeit shallow. 
My only gripe is directed at ... Nice cottagers. Best on Ontario Poor comfort stations, more showers than bathrooms. Good place but :  campgrounds are too close to each other;  also, security guards never enforce quiet times in the night even in the radio free sites and therefore so many people every night are being loud way after midnight and the ... Beautiful place, great hiking, lovely beaches! Very clean, park staff are friendly and helpful. Excellent sites. Only issue is the 400 is close and quite loud. You can hear the traffic 24/7 from the whole park. Other than that, great experience. Went there to hike. Forgot to put on bug repellent. The mosquitoes there were TERRIFYING. Dozens of mosquitoes were constantly following me throughout the hike. We visited in the winter, while it is closed, for some cross country skiing. Made our own trails and used the snowmobile trails. Cold, hardwork and absolutely gorgeous! We had an amazing time camping in this beautiful park! This is a nice park with a large lake that allows for hours of exploration by canoe or kayak. There are some extremely nice camp sites, including some lake front sites. The down side of this park is not the park staff or warden's fault. ... I've live at Six Mile and have knon the park before it became a park. Well organized and very picturesque. So much to do and easy access. Great boating fishing aand swimming.Love the area. I hear this was a terrific place for a family camping outing A great spot except.for the noise. The campsites are near highway 400. The staff make a lot of noise with the beach grooming equipment starting at 7:15 am. There is currently heavy construction in one campground. Two people beaches and ... Good spot for family camping close to water Love this place. Some great camp sites but way too busy during the summer. Great park, but the noise coming off hwy 400 is really bad. I went kayaking out onto the lake and I could still hear the hwy. The hwy itself does not have any sound barriers. As far as sound goes I'd rate this park a 1 out of 5. The lake ... Loved our visit nice staff and great weather I went there late in September. Well-maintained, and beautiful place. Perfect for camping. At the time I was there it was really quiet. Could be crowded during summer time especially on weekends. it's a good camping spot for families.. Great spot, small sites. Nice trail. My dog enjoyed the beach here! Decent park, good campsites, and very accessible from the highway... but a bit too close! You can hear the hum of hwy 400 traffic from everywhere in the park. The beaches also weren't very great. Great place to hike and Kayak Nice park with great beaches and lots of boat slips available, a new comfort station and a good general store We go here every year. Spent one night here on one of the walk-in sites (#19). We didn't get to see too much of the park, but the parts we did see were quite nice. The boat dock area is great, and we actually managed to catch a couple small pike right there. ... The only problem with Six Mile Lake is that eventually we'll have to leave and we can't take it with us. good place to fishing and family camping.  But lack of modern washrooms(?) and shower booth.   Most of toilets are Vault toilets.   Just 2 toilets are  the flush toilet. Great park minis provincial park officers. They're  rude and tend to pick on groups with visible  minorities.  Would  not come back to this park.  Officer Catelin Diver constantly  picked on our group.  I question her credibility  and her ability  as an office.  Complete abusive  of power. Nice place Nice canoeing spot Some really nice spots if tent camping. Limited nice sites for trailer camping. Very nice trails.  Beautiful place for relaxation. Some noise from hwy 400. Canoeing was very peaceful Hard to find a private site that's big, but everything is beautiful. Hiking trails were easy and the kids enjoyed them. Beautiful park with lots of wildlife! Great beach and nice campsites Great location. Water is warm for swimming. Canoe and kayaking rentals.  Soon will have 2nd shower/ comfort station. This park and lake are one of the nicest provincial parks in ontario. Never camped but the boat launch is fantastic. Parking for boats is pretty far away from the launch Gorgeous Park and campgrounds. Camp sites are small, but park is clean and well maintained. Make sure you get a site close to the lake, I think it's unserviced though... Small park adjacent to a very noisy Hwy400 is almost entirely occupied by the campgrounds. The few short hiking trails are getting very close to the campsites at times, making the stroll a little bit awkward as if you were walking ... Lovely small park.  Can hear noise from highway in some locations. Great park.staff at the gate were very helpful,as our site was not ready....the rangers were great .thanks Ryan . you must visit... Happy camping Nice little park. The lake is big enough to use medium size fishing boats and recreational crafts like kayaks.  Highway 400 noise is constant, day and night. Awesome place to fish! Park is small, but nice. Only downside to mention is the bathroom situation. There's literally only two stalls for the entire park. There is an out house available if needed. Two boat launch docks with available parking. We got mostly for day use Amazing park for camping A great park, with great campsites and a lake that’s pretty nice. I’ve been here a few times and plan to come back again soon. Good provincial park. Paid around C$15 for day entry. We'll serviced place. Beautiful park with plenty of activities for the kids (both big and small).  The staff is incredibly friendly and ready to help out should you require assistance.

We had a blast at the park and will be returning next season. Good mix of stuff to do at the park. Our site was a not at all as rated online through provincial parks booking system Scenery was beautiful, staff friendly.  A great place to relax and enjoy nature Decent sites Beautiful place and nice hiking trails. Definitely would go back!  One of nicer parks in Ontario, great for canoeing Great park for camping and canoeing Nice park. LOTS of sites makes it a little congested. Especially during the summer. It was a lovely campsite with lots to do and variety of facility.
I visited during the civil day long weekend and the camp grounds were packed (only dropped by for day visit). Went for a 2 hrs hike, chilled on the beach and rented a ... Nice beach. Pretty good campsites. But that persistent rumble from the 400 gets frustrating.  Park was clean, staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. Was mostly quiet while we were there, but watch out which site you choose as the 400 is only a few hundred meters away. 

We were originally in a 3## lot, and could see traffic ... Nice clean campsites, showers are great,  park rangers are awesome and very helpful. The place is definitely beautiful and the lake is picturesque (though a bit shallow for enjoyable swimming), and would probably be great for small kids. But don't expect good (long) hikes... The only tail there is quite short, unless you wander outside the park on snowmobile trails. Best place Great beach, good canoeing places and lots more My family comes here every year for the past 6 years or so on civic long weekend and we have never had any issues what so ever.  It's a great place to swim, hike,  and be outdoors.   Beautiful lake, lots of kayaks and canoes to rent, great staff ! (Better row quick to avoid the bugs) The park is OK, but the sounds of traffic from the nearby highway bring it down a bit. The lake is gorgeous though. Beautiful and relaxing Clean facilities. The site was kept clean, and the Park staff were all friendly.   park provide so many activities. Great spot for first time fishing.  Great beach, camping site nice and clean, lots of washrooms in close proximity, family friendly area Great place for kid Have been enjoying this park since I was little, staff is great and organize many activities for visitors. Lake is also decent in size over fished and rocks could be marked better but there are lots of great areas for water-skiing.  Great scenery and campsites! The water is beautiful and the fishing is decent. Washrooms are cleaner than I would have expected. Be sure to check the campsite nap before you book, as some sites can have neighbours very close by. The lake is amazing once you get out on it. Staff are friendly. The campsites are hit-or-miss; make sure you check the pictures online so you know what you are getting into. They have a nice trail but it's only 20-30 minutes --- great ... Small park, with about 3km of nice trails. Very close to a heavy traffic  hwy though; camping may not be a good experience . Great location, wish there were more comfort stations with showers  Great layout, clean sites and facilities,  just a bit cramped closer to main road Great camping spot Very relaxing Nice campground but sites were a little too close together Loved it! No children's programming anymore.  Nature center closed.  Canoe rentals are $60/day Great park, quiet, good swimming and fishing, very busy on holiday's Great place to camp. Clean beach. Large lake and canoe rental available. Great place to hide from city noise. Fresh air worked nicely, haven't slept so well in months. :) Great vacation place. Sandy beaches. Large wooded camp sites. Flush toilets. Fire pit and 2 picnic tables per site. Pets available. Open areas for playing field games. Parks area for children. Hiking trails. A popular park but relatively less busy than some of the provincial parks. ProTip: get a camping spot right on the lake for a great experience. Otherwise, ask for a more private spot further in the park. It was fun... would like to visit again and again and again... :) but few -ve points are... lots of mosquitoes, many camp sites are very close to each other and mostly all camp sites are on the road side. When you book camp site make ... Beautiful place. The camping sites are quite crowded, and the beaches are small for weekend occupancy. Nice Marsh hiking trails!  Beautiful places! This park is beautiful, the staff are happy, helpful and wonderful people. Its a great choice for camping or day use! The campsites are fairly small and very close to the road that the other campers have to drive by on. That means less privacy and the cars constantly kick up dust into the campground.
The bathrooms were awful. They did not flush like the ... Great Nature experience lots of open water for fun activities. People and animals are super friendly.  Best spot for camping, had a great time Very clean, good variety of activities, great location Nice park.

A beautiful place to spend a weekend at. That is, of course, if you're into Nature. Well maintained trails, camp grounds and lakes.
Just a beautiful experience overall. One of the best hiking spots in Ontario. Lost of trails that vary in lengths and difficulty levels with the more strenuous also being most rewarding. The views from the peaks are world-class and an occasional dip in the frigid waters of Lake Superior will refresh even the most tired hiker. I come here twice a year and hike and camp in the interior with my dog. We both love it. Last spring my dog and I hiked all along the Kaybeun Trail from Thunder bay lookout to and around the Giant to south end trailhead.

Stayed here in August and the park was packed but everyone kept respectfully quiet. Unfortunately they had barely any showers operational. Beautiful provincial park.

The nearest ... The camping here is amazing, there's lots of sites with their own water access and the shoreline is fantastic.  My wife and I drove/camped across Canada and this was one of the highlights as far as parks went.  Beautiful scenery, hiking, and swimming. I'd recommend sleeping giant to anyone heading towards Thunder Bay. Great view and beautiful. Camping at its finest. Good for canoeing and kayaking, which can be rented at the park. Good for fishing bass, perch and okay for pike, hardly any or no Walleye. Great staff. Very beautiful. Quite busy with a lot of people backcountry camping. If you are hiking The Feet... Be warned that it is very difficult and climbers should be good physical shape. A lot of boulders and a steep almost 90 degree hike up the feet. Get there early if you want a backcountry site as they fill up fast :) A bit out of the way but that's why you go there. Lake Marie Louise is a beautiful fun spot for swimming or fishing. Family fun for everyone. This park is stunning and tranquil. Make sure you visit the Thunder Bay lookout point, breathtaking. This place is huge and very high cliffs!  Hikers haven!  Beautiful place This park is beautiful, and there are many trails of varying lengths and difficulties. The trails that take you to the Top of the Giant is a full day hike, but the views from the top are worth it. Love the park! It is quite a ways off highway but worth the drive! :) Lovely park. Nice and quiet. Spectacular landscape you didn't expect to see in Ontario! Hard to get to the top, but it worth it! Awesome hiking, great views. Rent a mountain bike to get to some trail heads more quickly. Best place for good pictures..swimming...lot more Good facilities -helpful staff -about 40 km from the hwy to the park - good shower, washing machines and bathrooms -sites with power -took a drive past the old minor's houses -signed up for the geological discussion by an retired geologist -worth the effort I went for a hike with friends along this trail during vacation this past summer and it was amazing! I would highly recommend bringing some bug spray because there are many mosquitoes as the walk is in the middle of the woods and can ... Nice variety of trails but very confusing maps with no legends on them otherwise I would rate it 4,  mary Louise lake is nice to kayak in with a cosy beach , no wifi and very limited network access in the park Nice campground at Marie Louise Lake. Visitor Centre includes interactive exhibits. Many trails of varying difficulty. We enjoyed hiking the Sea Lion trail. Breathtaking views from the top of the Giant and along the park trails. Definitely a place to return to! Sleeping giant is a hidden gem for hikers, mountain bikers, and all outdoor enthusiasts. Breathtaking views, massive cliffs, and quiet shores await you here, do yourself a favor and plan a trip ASAP! Awesome very scenic plan to camp her next year Great hiking trails. Very beautiful place. I couldn't believe that many people don't know about this place. It's a natural environment classified park and it's amazing. Clean facilities. Great for families. Great for hiking, biking, walking. Friendly staff. 10 out of 10 The sheer size and beauty of this park is enough to draw you in, but the spectacular view of Thunder Bay and the Sleeping Giant from the Superior Lookout are just breathtaking! Gorgeous scenery, endless amounts of fun for the whole family It's  great to hear the loons at night and quite  peaceful. What an amazing experience. The landscape leading up to the park was even stunning.
Watch for a fox & deer in the campgrounds who are -clearly- in cahoots in their scavenging... we witnessed them maneuvre unnoticed between a few campsites- definite teamwork though! They need names. Great trails. Beach and camp sites . Not enough bathroom facilities!  camping  rates are high ! Such a beautiful place. An absolute treasure Georgous park ! Spent 2 days and would definitely go back and spend a week. Wonderful, well-run park. Campground is kept neat and the bathrooms were clean. The trails were easy to find and the views were beautiful. Nice playgrounds at the beach. Been a couple of times and absolutely love this place Great sights. Top of the head trail is pretty difficult for a nice view. Does not, however, beat the view from the top of the giant trail, in my opinion. Absolutely gorgeous..  I was here in autumn.. would love to see it during summer! Incredible place to spend time. Had a fabulous time hiking up to the knees. Fantastic trail - long but not too steep except for 2 parts. We saw groups of families with young kids (6-12) running up, so it's really not that bad. Expect to take about 6-8 hours. View up top is astonishing; we flew to Thunder Bay ... Beautiful landscape, awesome swimming. I always do the sleeping giant loppet there. It is a GREAT race. I have never been there in the summer. Nicest beach without having to fly. Absolutely wonderful. I'll be back again! Vast park with some breath taking scenery, would have love to stay here for longer. There's camp grounds on site so saving that for next time. Bring bug spray as mosquitoe season can be quite an eye opener. Love this special place! Amazing trails, views, and campsites. The secluded sites on the opposite side of the lake from the main campground are perfect (quiet, well separated, lake access, etc.) Lots of trails to hike, but roads could be marked a little better Vast provincial park. Take your full day of to cover a small percentage of the park. Beautiful park. For the May long weekend someone of the trails weren't cleaned up of fallen trees yet, which actually added to our experience of nature. Rangers were extremely helpful. Plenty of deer around. Camping sites had very little privacy. No phone signals. I used to love this park, both the Marie Louise Lake camp grounds, and the back country spots.  

Unfortunately, in recent years the Marie Louise Lake camp ground has essentially become a party place for the youth of Thunder Bay and ... A good place to hike, camp and enjoy a breath taking scenery. We went there unprepared so we just had to go to the shortest trail (30 minutes) which is the way to the sea lion, and that place is awesome. The lake was clear and cold, and the view was worth it.  There's lots of good hiking here. The camp sites are nice. Except for the skunks recently. They were pretty friendly when we were there. Didn't spray, but who wants to take that chance?  The beach is great. Probably one of the best parts of the park.  The hike was long and tiring, but absolutely worth it! We had a great time and enjoyed back country camping at Tee Harbour and all the sights! 

However, while packing up at 12:30pm park employees came right into our campsite and started ... Amazing park. Loved it. We are coming back on our way to Ottawa from BC and we asked for the same spot. Clean bathrooms. Even saw a large deer walk through our site at 1am!! Definitely worth the climb.  The view from the top is bucket list worthy. I always stop here every time I drive across Canada, it's one of my favourite parks to stay in. I always end up seeing wildlife such as skunks, grey foxes and usually deer also. Great place!  We had a fantastic 2 days at sleeping giant. Rented some mountain bikes and took to a recommended trail. Only issue is that it might need to be a bit more maintained than it is. Our campsite at Mary Louise campground site 134 had little ... Awesome place Great climb. Stellar views Beautiful park! We wish we had gotten to the park sooner to allow for more time to hike. Next time we will bring bikes for part of the trail and then hike the rest. We didn't make it to the top as ran out of time which was a bummer. Make sure to pack some food and drinks with if you plan to hike the distance!  Great campground, spent a night and wish we could have spent more. Great hiking, awesome view of the sleeping giant from the beach, stayed at site 114 and had stairs right down from behind our spot, great location. Great place to spend a day Lots of hiking trails for any ability level. Beautiful scenery, clear dark skies at night for astronomy. Plenty of wildlife, nice campsites.  Just bring plenty with you, it's a long drive out to get food or gas. This prov park is by far one of the top ones in the prov. Beautiful scenery.  Fantastic trails to hike for all some very nice lakes to fish and swim in.  We habe been twice in the last couple of yrs amd will most likely be back. A little out of the way, but a great place to camp and hike. Just be ready for noisy morons on the campgrounds. Had a lovely time. Staff were very nice. Views from the Giant are amazing The bathrooms were spotless, the staff were very friendly, and there was very minimal garbage on the ground. There were lots of camping sites, some were quite close together but others had more privacy. The only ""bad"" thing I have to say is it was quite a long drive into the camping area from the highway. What beautiful campground! Except for the night the campground ran out of wood and wasn't delivered until 11pm. Actually I had to chase the park warden down. Great hiking trails. Staff were friendly and helpful.  Showers and bathrooms we clean.   Park was well maintained.   Lots of wildlife.   Will definately make the trek back up Natural wonder here in Northwest Ontario.  Many Native tales surrounding this beautiful piece of glacial carved stone.  Surrounded by Lake Superior the Sleeping Giant rests and only changes with the colours of the seasons. Cool trails and awesome sights Beautiful park. Note that the campground is about 30 minutes off of the main highway. We stayed in the campsites on the west side of the lake. They're more private and scenic, but require a 10 minute drive on dirt roads in and out. The hiking is incredible.  Great place! beautiful hiking spots!! An amazing park! Signage leaves a little bit to be desired as we had a bit of trouble finding the visitor center as it is hidden in the back of the campground. We hiked the short trail to the sea lion. It is a great place to get away ... Didn't meet my expectations. Maybe I had high expectations. But good for hiking. If you can visit Kekabeka Falls if you can.  Great views. Super buggy. The animals while cute were way too friendly. Fantastic hiking! Found a trail down to the shoreline and jumped into the water. The hike was pretty tough at places, be sure to have real hiking boots and pants. Lots of climbing over fallen trees!  Amazing place. We were greeted to our camp site by a family of ducks and a deer that walked on through. There are a lot of trails in the area. Recommend the Sea Lion and if you are up for it the top of the Giant, although be prepared, and set the day aside for it, well worth it.  Look forward to going again Stay was good  everything very clean  and staff are helpful only thing they should have more programs and activities for kids through out the summer! Absolutely great A nice park, tho over priced for amount of traffic they get. Groomed trails are easy to hike, Signs every where. you will see wild life like deer, birds and maybe the odd bear. Highly recommend the day hike to the top of the giant. Make sure you keep going past the peak for some amazing views. Beautiful park! Clean, sites are large and private. Lots of hiking trails and biking trails.  Staff was helpful.  Stayed 2 days on our way around Lake Superior worth it! Drive into park is 20 miles but scenic, stayed on Marie Louise Lake ... Absolutely gorgeous park. Hiked to the top of the Sleeping Giant, which was about 11 km from the parking lot and almost 1000 feet vertical climb. Absolutely breathtaking views. Mary Louise lake campground had lots of sites but they were ... this place is just just so breath taking. lots of hikes trails, and a long bike trail.  Well worth the drive to see the scenery and history (at Silver Islet). Great camping grounds with a Sandy beach. Hiking trails are nice too. The views are worth the trip!  Beautiful campground. Lake side camp sites are great!  Beautiful camping, campground at Mary Louise can be a tad crowded even mid week.  The animals here have OBVIOUSLY been benefiting from humans feeding them and are not scared of humans in the least.  Ducks roaming my campsite for crumbs ... Love love love that park! Would recommend but! Bring anti mosquitos! Loved seeing all the wildlife, good clean park. The only thing I would have asked for is better trail markings and distance. Overall best ontario park I have been too ❤ My wife and I are avid hikers and really enjoyed the challenging hikes at Sleeping Giant. There are so many trails and hiking possibilities that the park could keep you busy for days. The views are varied and breathtaking while the hikes ... Unforgettable park Amazing. Highly recommend to anyone. Beautiful park. Very nice campgrounds and great hiking.  Something to do for everyone! Great way to spend the day. Great hikes and beautiful scenery.  Loved it!  Beautiful park.  Look out for the bears though.  We had one in our campsite.  We ate breakfast, and were just going to change in the tent before going to throw away our (maybe a 5-10 minute delay?) And a bear showed up in our site to go after the trash.  Changed our mind about grilling lunch after that. :-) Views are awesome, visitor services/wayfinding need to be more clear Lots of trails and opportunities for adventure. Be sure to check out the bird observatory if it's the right season! Beautiful park. Gorgeous views. Fantastic trails for hiking and cross country skiing. Great views of lake and Thunder Bay. A very quite and peaceful campground great for tenters Great PP. One of best I have been 2. Very clean. Great RV sites. Lots of trails. Would return. Excellent park, especially early or late in the season when you have the place to yourself. Hiking and biking, and Marie Louise lake is excellent for kayaking around. Many campsites are right on the water. (I have to believe that the people giving the park a 1 star rating are trying to keep it a secret.) Campground was good. Some sites are close together. The actual sleeping giant provides a cool view. Anything in nature is beautiful! Great place to go camping and hiking. Saw a lot of deer on the drive in.  Warning though: the 300s campsites take a bit of an extra off-road drive to get to! Been here twice. The first time I underestimated the time it took to get up to the top of the giant so I had to rush back to the parking lot to avoid hiking in pitch dark, but gotta say the view up the top is well worth the trek if you ... Great hiking experience and outing for groups. One of the best parks in Ontario, great trails with a large variety of difficulty levels for different levels/ages.  Wonderful views off trails and even a great drive to lookout at the ""Thunder Bay Lookout"".  Have been frequenting for years and bringing the kids as their hiking abilities change as they get older. Best campsite I've been to in Ontario So pretty!! Would not recommend in winter, it was so slippery and icy everywhere  Great area. Highly recommend the 6-8 hour round trip hike to the gorge, best view there. If possible, bike to the top of the giant trail to shave off a few hours.  Not to far from Thunder Bay. Excellent hiking trails.  Great hiking trails particularly the one leading to the top of the Giant. Staff at the park were friendly and courteous. Lots of wildlife to see in and around the park. Will definitely be going back.   BEAUTIFUL. Amazing hiking trails and vistas all across the park. Had to pay $15 to get in for the day pass. That was a little disappointing as there was not much amenities for that cost. We went to the beach which was very rocky and messy. The beach could be grated or something so the sand is all that remains.  Hiked Top of the Giant trail. Wonderful day hike, 22 km, 550m total elevation. Take water. Excellent example of old growth boreal forest in an easily accessible campground.  Great for families and dayhikes, as well as interior camping. I love camping here, good hiking trails, great interpretive centre, and a family friendly beach.  If you can do it then make sure go all the way to the top of the giant. Difficult but amazing trail. Especially towards the end. Great park staff, beautiful lake. We planned on doing an easy hike along ""sawyer trail"" since we had a late start to our day (we drove from TBay at approx. 1pm). Once off the highway onto the 587 it's a pleasant winding road into the park. It's poorly indicated, but you ... Such a beautiful place to go camping, hiking, biking, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing. Gorgeous views. Beautiful scenery with large beach. Tons of trails to explore. Daily planned activities for kids and adults. Very good view , challenging , hiking trails are good, long way in but well worth it Loved experiencing the wild life and rocks! Very scenic park, lots of wildlife. Nice bathroom with showers. Stopped here during a motorcycle tour, wonderful! We have a gem among us! Been living here for over 18 years and finally hiked the giant! Will do it again for sure.  Love it there, wish I could spend more time  Gorgeous and the trails were well groomed Beautiful park. Unbelievable hiking opportunities.  Great camping with outstanding views Amazing! Awesome place for camping, hiking and site seeing.  Great place to camp.  Great place and view I have my passport ready and hope to have a positive experience visiting Sleeping Giant Provincial Park on November 3rd the 307th day of the year and April 23rd the 113 day of the year.  I Mention these to dates for a reason putting ... Nice park, beautiful views. Interesting history.  Excellent Great place for hiking  Enormous park practically teeming with wildlife.  Great place for hiking minus the bugs nice location away from the TCH, extremely expensive, over $40.00 for one night, one person, one tent, no services. Beautiful views and excellent hiking.   Amazing place Always an amazing place to visit Highly recommend Grate backpacking trails and lookouts. Love it! Nature is everywhere.  😍😍😍 (Translated by Google) I did not like. I felt drowned and totally isolated. They do not offer more electricity than that and it's deep in the forest. The road to get there is very bad. And it is not true that it is in front of Lake ...

That is, of course, if you're into Nature. Well maintained trails, camp grounds and lakes.
Just a beautiful experience overall. One of the best hiking spots in Ontario. Lost of trails that vary in lengths and difficulty levels with the more strenuous also being most rewarding. The views from the peaks are world-class and an occasional dip in the frigid waters of Lake Superior will refresh even the most tired hiker. I come here twice a year and hike and camp in the interior with my dog. We both love it. Last spring my dog and I hiked all along the Kaybeun Trail from Thunder bay lookout to and around the Giant to south end trailhead. Spent 11 days out there Spent a week at sleeping giant and had a fantastic time! We stayed on a water front site 204. It is an electrical site with water just out front and clean vault toilet very close by. A quick walk to the beach and a bike ride to the ... Great hiking trails and campground.  We bought a day pass and hiked the Sea Lion trail.  Then went into the visitors center and learn all about Silver Islet and the park and checked out the beach.  Looks like good swimming at the beach ... We drove up this summer and spent a week in the 300's. The interior campsites are super- clean and even had a picnic table. Wherever you pitch your tent  in the 300's,  you're only feet away from the shores of Marie Louise Lake. You can ... I have far from seen the whole park, but that areas that I have seen are gorgeous.

The bays and coves are amazing, and if on the correct side it's like looking out over the ocean.
Hike a are well maintained and trails are marked when required.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the outdoors A must see for all traveling through our great city The staff and location are wonderful.  Many hikes to go on and a beautiful beach. NOW MANAGMENT YOU HAVE 2 PROBLEMS. 1. How do we keep that little receipt on our dash to prove we paid, please provide tape so we can keep it on the window. ... Stayed here in August and the park was packed but everyone kept respectfully quiet. Unfortunately they had barely any showers operational. Beautiful provincial park. Lots of great opportunities for hiking. Very well maintained. Nice private sites. Store hrs too short for the distance you must drive off park grounds to store. Would recommend this park.

The animals here have OBVIOUSLY been benefiting from humans feeding them and are not scared of humans in the least.  Ducks roaming my campsite for crumbs ... Love love love that park! Would recommend but! Bring anti mosquitos! Loved seeing all the wildlife, good clean park. The only thing I would have asked for is better trail markings and distance. Overall best ontario park I have been too ❤ My wife and I are avid hikers and really enjoyed the challenging hikes at Sleeping Giant. There are so many trails and hiking possibilities that the park could keep you busy for days. The views are varied and breathtaking while the hikes ... Unforgettable park Amazing. Highly recommend to anyone. Beautiful park. Very nice campgrounds and great hiking.  Something to do for everyone! Great way to spend the day. Great hikes and beautiful scenery.  Loved it!  Beautiful park.  Look out for the bears though.  We had one in our campsite.  We ate breakfast, and were just going to change in the tent before going to throw away our (maybe a 5-10 minute delay?) And a bear showed up in our site to go after the trash.  Changed our mind about grilling lunch after that. :-) Views are awesome, visitor services/wayfinding need to be more clear Lots of trails and opportunities for adventure. Be sure to check out the bird observatory if it's the right season! Beautiful park. Gorgeous views. Fantastic trails for hiking and cross country skiing. Great views of lake and Thunder Bay. A very quite and peaceful campground great for tenters Great PP. One of best I have been 2. Very clean. Great RV sites. Lots of trails. Would return. Excellent park, especially early or late in the season when you have the place to yourself. Hiking and biking, and Marie Louise lake is excellent for kayaking around. Many campsites are right on the water. (I have to believe that the people giving the park a 1 star rating are trying to keep it a secret.) Campground was good. Some sites are close together. The actual sleeping giant provides a cool view. Anything in nature is beautiful! Great place to go camping and hiking. Saw a lot of deer on the drive in.  Warning though: the 300s campsites take a bit of an extra off-road drive to get to! Been here twice. The first time I underestimated the time it took to get up to the top of the giant so I had to rush back to the parking lot to avoid hiking in pitch dark, but gotta say the view up the top is well worth the trek if you ... Great hiking experience and outing for groups. One of the best parks in Ontario, great trails with a large variety of difficulty levels for different levels/ages.  Wonderful views off trails and even a great drive to lookout at the ""Thunder Bay Lookout"".  Have been frequenting for years and bringing the kids as their hiking abilities change as they get older. Best campsite I've been to in Ontario So pretty!! Would not recommend in winter, it was so slippery and icy everywhere  Great area. Highly recommend the 6-8 hour round trip hike to the gorge, best view there. If possible, bike to the top of the giant trail to shave off a few hours.  Not to far from Thunder Bay. Excellent hiking trails.  Great hiking trails particularly the one leading to the top of the Giant. Staff at the park were friendly and courteous. Lots of wildlife to see in and around the park. Will definitely be going back.   BEAUTIFUL. Amazing hiking trails and vistas all across the park. Had to pay $15 to get in for the day pass. That was a little disappointing as there was not much amenities for that cost. We went to the beach which was very rocky and messy. The beach could be grated or something so the sand is all that remains.  Hiked Top of the Giant trail. Wonderful day hike, 22 km, 550m total elevation. Take water. Excellent example of old growth boreal forest in an easily accessible campground.  Great for families and dayhikes, as well as interior camping. I love camping here, good hiking trails, great interpretive centre, and a family friendly beach.  If you can do it then make sure go all the way to the top of the giant. Difficult but amazing trail. Especially towards the end. Great park staff, beautiful lake. We planned on doing an easy hike along ""sawyer trail"" since we had a late start to our day (we drove from TBay at approx. 1pm). Once off the highway onto the 587 it's a pleasant winding road into the park. It's poorly indicated, but you ... Such a beautiful place to go camping, hiking, biking, cross country skiing, and snowshoeing. Gorgeous views. Beautiful scenery with large beach. Tons of trails to explore. Daily planned activities for kids and adults. Very good view , challenging , hiking trails are good, long way in but well worth it Loved experiencing the wild life and rocks! Very scenic park, lots of wildlife. Nice bathroom with showers. Stopped here during a motorcycle tour, wonderful! We have a gem among us! Been living here for over 18 years and finally hiked the giant! Will do it again for sure.  Love it there, wish I could spend more time  Gorgeous and the trails were well groomed Beautiful park. Unbelievable hiking opportunities.  Great camping with outstanding views Amazing! Awesome place for camping, hiking and site seeing.  Great place to camp.  Great place and view I have my passport ready and hope to have a positive experience visiting Sleeping Giant Provincial Park on November 3rd the 307th day of the year and April 23rd the 113 day of the year.  I Mention these to dates for a reason putting ... Nice park, beautiful views. Interesting history.  Excellent Great place for hiking  Enormous park practically teeming with wildlife.  Great place for hiking minus the bugs nice location away from the TCH, extremely expensive, over $40.00 for one night, one person, one tent, no services. Beautiful views and excellent hiking.   Amazing place Always an amazing place to visit Highly recommend Grate backpacking trails and lookouts. Love it! Nature is everywhere.  😍😍😍 (Translated by Google) I did not like. I felt drowned and totally isolated. They do not offer more electricity than that and it's deep in the forest. The road to get there is very bad. And it is not true that it is in front of Lake ...

It's a nice park but has a touristy feel to it. It's definitely a park where people go to party as it's so close to the main strip. I'd stay here again for a quick weekend but nothing more as we like the up north experience. The campsite was very spacious, well maintained and moderately private. We were able to see many fireflies at night. Other than the beach which was quite distant outside the park, I didn’t find many attractions or activities within the ... Beautiful park with large sites. Close to a big beach on Lake Erie and wonderful winery's. There are local produce growers and during the summer there is a plethora of fresh things to eat. Turkey Point Provincial Park and village are quaint and small village stretched along the Ontario north shore of Lake Erie one and a half hours west of Hamilton.
Great soft sandy beach, a number of restaurants and eateries and boat ... Turkey Point is a really fun provincial park.  The sites were well maintained and the amenities were very good.

The beach was a bit of a distance from the park itself, and you had to go into town to get to it... which, if you're ... Great place to mountain bike. Good variety of trails. Well marked, maps in the park. Some hills, some flats. Great hiking spot. Different types of forest and terrain, easy to extreme well marked trails. Another fantastic Provincial Park. 
Well maintained and kept clean. 
A Friendly staff that was very accommodating.
The park however has exclusively sold Pepsi Products for years. A change would be nice. I would also like to see better equipped stores throughout the Parks Province wide. This is a beautifull park with beaches, camping, entertainment and sandbar on the beach for good eats.
The water gets organic in high heat periods, but it's clean.
Right on the inner longpoint bay, makes it great for boating.
Highly recommend trying this one. A great park and wonderful forest to stroll around in Great beach... shallow waters... good place to go not much shade Was disappointed when we found out the park wasn't on Lake Erie. No beach without a car. The comfort stations are lacking in cleanliness and need updating. I refused to use the showers. The sites were just okay. Lots of ants in the area. Park was incredibly loud until 2:30 or 3 am both nights we stayed--sleep was impossible. Additionally, the other family we camped with had a site much smaller and much less private than ours but was only $10 less - a larger price difference would have been more realistic for the lack of quality comparison. Such a beautiful place to take your kids. Not overly crowded like most parks and visitors take care in cleaning up. Keeping it beautiful It is very nice cottage country, love the scenery and all the beautiful cottages there. But this place is only good if you are going to be at a cottage or camping ground close to the beach otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it because ... Love the easy access to the beach.  Lots of parking Nice park on the lake with lots of activities for all ages Great spot for one day picnics... The beach is Rocky but clean. Amazing view of the sunset!! Beach here sucks and be careful there is a rip tide. Turkey Point hotel across the street has a great restaurant highly recommended but if you're looking for a good beach I recommend Port Dover over Turkey Point We came here 19 years ago for our honeymoon with our kids and loved it. We decided a couple days ago to sneak away and Turkey Point Provincial park had the perfect spot. Nice amount of privacy, great campfire and everyone out strolling ... Like this park only for its proximity to the beach.sites are very open with no privacy.too much noise and allround sillyness.by younger patrons.should be patrolled better. I'm not a prude but when I camp, I like to enjoy where I am. Park is always clean. The beach is great. Much better than dover.  Have been camping here for 24 years. The staff is always friendly. Sometimes on the weekends it can be a little noisey, but nothing out of hand. The beach can sometimes ... Nice campground.  Wish the beach was closer to the campground though, it's beautiful.  Also, playground didn't really have much for toddlers.  Small other complaint, there really weren't any clearings close by to watch the stars. Washroomsamong the cleanest seen at a provincial park. Group campsite was good. Nearby beach was not walking distance, and the vehicle lineup to get through the single entry point was very long at peak hours. Great place for kids.  Shallow water.  Just wish there were full bathroom facilities as opposed to an upgraded outhouse Turkey Point the lake was awesome. People there were welcome in and great Sea-Doos are great and fun if you ever get a chance to go on one I recommend you do it if you ever get a chance to go to Turkey Point I recommend you do it there's ... Love this campground and the town itself. Beach is beautiful Nice lively beach!  Pull your car up sand-side and enjoy.  Current parking fee is $14.50.  If you're staying at Turkey Point Provincial Park, show your vehicle permit and parking is free. The beach is nice but there are many things that make it not so nice. There isn't much sand space to rest, and the water was dirty with pieces of wood, seaweed etc, so the water was not clear. There were a number of jet skis laying ... I visited the day use beach and I was pleasantly surprised with the maintenance and overall cleanliness. The water was clean and inviting. Amazing place to bring the family !
1km away from this camp site is the beach that has tons of activities for people of all ages !
The camp sites on ""walking stick"" camp grounds aren't as private but we made due!
I reccomend this place for sure ! Went camping here and had a great time! I'd definitely be willing to come back Water is not too rough, just wish they would rake the beach more. Great space to stay for a weekend, short drive or walk to the water! Great place to camp! Best beach in Ontario. Go early as it gets very busy! Very decent beach with cleaner water than port dover Great get away location close enough to the cities but far enough away to escape it all. Great time camping with the family.  Camp sites are small and irregularly shaped. The bathrooms are clean, but in desperate need of repairs and very few and far between. Great Beach a little crowded in the summer. Bring food and drinks because the stores are very expensive. Nice park but farmers keep shooting off bangers to scare the birds from their crops. Starts at 6 a.m. Very loud. Gorgeous beach. Not too busy in off season. Beautiful beach, warm water and decent parking. There are bathrooms and they're decently clean. Turkey point beaches and conservation regions are a great place to visit and camp it's worth the time to go with family or friends when the weather is scorching hot,and the safe swimming zone is marked. The area around the beach is a beautiful countryside. Really peaceful not too busy. need to go early in the morning so that no need to get frustated about parking. Great camping nice and clean but the water is too far away. The beach is somewhat dirty and there are way too many boats and scooters. The water was not very clear. Also, although very long, the beach is not wide so it easily gets crowded on a hot day. Good thing about it is that it has a lot of natural shade. Beautiful spot, great for anyone! It's a great beach 
It's my new go to beach 
See you later Dover Standard provincial park.  Lots of posion ivy and lots of mosquitoes but good sites. A lot of sand makes for dirty camping.  Prefer port Burwell as it is grass. Great place to camp if you are looking for a great place to camp. Nearly 100km in spectacular trails. You do not want to miss out on a chance to ride here. The park attendants aren't very clear on instructions of which campsites to choose from. But very beautiful and very well maintained park. Big camp ground in great condition and great location in south west Ontario. Easy to advanced trails at your door and one Kilometre to the beach Beautiful beach and clean water with ample free public parking. The beach is nice and not too crowded, the jetski’s were fun Our Summer is never complete without beach day at Turkey Point! Nice beach, no parking unless you get there early! Lucked out because it rained all of this weekend but the campsites are good for tents or trailers. Would definitely recommend for a weekend camping trip Fantastic there  I loved the park.i recommend  to go there camping Long Point is the best beach in the area. Turkey Point is great for boating, and beach / boating. Nice spot that's no overly busy. Sand in places are gravelly Love Turkey Point. Camping is great, the beach is beautiful and the jet ski's are awesome at Waveline. Shopping along the beach is outrageous. 50 bucks for an umbrella and sunscreen.  Beach is nice . I enjoyed it Beautiful park! Beach is not connected to main park body but is a 5 minute drive. Lovely shallow water whittington the buoys. Beach gets very busy and doesn't have a lot of cover, so arrive early and bring a sunscreen, an umbrella, or a ... It's about what you expect from a Provincial Park on the lake. I thought that was a little pricey but it's a popular place. Play sand on the beach a few twigs but again it's on the lake it's expected Nice little area The place is absolutely filled with poison ivy and the bathrooms are horrific. We camp all over Ontario and this is by far the worst campground I have ever been to. The bathrooms are worse then most port-a-potties I've seen. There is no ... This is not really a good place to camp considering there are other places. I got an ear infection from the water there where people swim. There are also lots of poison ivy there so it is dangerous for kids. My friend got a tick bite ... It's a nice beach but small so it can get crowded on hot days, the sand has alot of twigs and leaves as does the water's edge but once u go past the edge where its dirty the water isnt as bad. Lots of boats on the area and jet skis. The local stores beachside are a bit overpriced. Ok for a short visit. Good beach - shallow so expect marine matter in the water but otherwise nice The beach was more of an ashtray 🤮. Not sure what was worse the thousands of cigarette butts or the overcrowding. Personally I enjoy a clean and more spacious beach day Beautiful spot. Some non paying parking available further west of the point. Nice place to relax but avoid  long weekend Very good Days coming parking 
Eating and barbecue Motel fishing boat rental place Tropical experience right here in Ontario awesome place! Amazing beach and the mini golf was so much fun! Excellent single track mountain bike trails, especially for Southern Ontario. There is a very well maintained network of trails for the mountain bike novice or enthusiast. There are maps at every junction with all trails mapped out with ... Beautiful beach great place to camp or just go for the day. Great bike trails. Will be returning for warm weather rides. Great place for camping and not far to the beach Beautiful place, clean trails to hike on! The staff is awesome and the protection of our parks is very important Great family park in a very natural setting. Great playground, golfcourse, beach, trails. Beach was a little dirty but overall a good trip! Parking is a little expensive Great spot to go for some beach fun. Not a ton of space for large groups. The best place to go gor camping. I like to go there often Great place for get away This is one of the good old parks. Old facilities, average - low privacy of the sites, absence of proper park store (only small store at the entrance). This place has ticks so beware . Popular for trailers. I also found it popular for youth, so expect it to get noisy and guards will not do much until 11pm. Beautiful park, bathrooms where clean and so much hot water I had to turn it down. Great park.  Always sites available. Great place and friendly staff. Visit during the ""off-season if you want some personal space on the beach sand. Awesome place to go mountain biking. One of the best places in Ontario. It is single track heaven. About 75km of single track. The trails are sandy and drain better then anywhere else. An awesome place for your fat bike year round. clear water open space beautiful view Rude employees and very disorganized. Poision ivy everywhere and the beach is in terrible condition. Would never go again. Waste of money. Excelent place for enjoy a camping and a wonderful beach with the family!!! Mountain bike trails are excellent.  Well marked out and lots of challenges. Fun and clean very nice for family's Fantastic beach my family and I love it! Nice beach in a small community. A great beach that is close to home. Lots of local activities, mountain biking is spectacular😀 Fun trails and quick drying this time of year for MTB. Awesome bike trails! Parking was a problem , beaches  were nice, party atmosphere Nice wooded campgrounds close to Lake Erie and a wide variety of activity I am so close to wanting to live there. Turkey point is a clean beach and a quite not very crowded place. Having a great time with my family! Friendly staff, nice campgrounds, and prices are more than fair for wood or ice & such, there's stores within 20 minutes if you need random stuff. Would definitely come back again and will recommend others to come!  This beach is Awesome. It is a clean beach. There is all ages of people that go there & it's a pretty quiet beach. I would recommend... it is definitely  more than a 5 star. This is such a nice beach and lots to do if you drive around. Food, jet skiing, ice cream, boating. Depending on where you stay, you can walk to some of these.
By main beach is All You Can Eat breakfast! 
The people are so nice and we always enjoy coming up! Not the best provincial park I have visited. Do yourself a favour and drive additional 15 minutes to long point PP Parking is close to the beach, makes it easy to take little kids Camp spots pretty tight for motorhome Great  time  with  friends and family I recently visited this park with my family and we had a great time. We were especially impressed by the large sites. Beach is close by with parking for permit holders. Overall a nice park. Nice Sunday drive to an awesome destinations.  Rewarded with beautiful beaches. Trail riding is awesome here This was a nice family oriented public beach located across from cottages.  The beach is sandy and the water bed is on the rockier side but shallow and marked.  Along the road there are a few shops to pick up beach toys and paraphernalia and one with a patio.  Not sure about food or drinks as i did not go into the shops.   I loved camping here. We camped primarily through the week- once Friday night arrived, the park got much louder which changed the feel of the trip. Overall, great experience. other than park it is a great beach Had a great time at the Beach. This park was the one place my friends and I could count on for a place to stay in our spontaneous travels through Norfolk County (Everything else was booked up for the weekend). And to our surprise, the park and campsites are very nice ... I loved this area. The nature hiking trails are very scenic and the town is beautiful. Great camping spot for anyone trying to get out of the city but not having to go very far. Kiddy land! Loved thus place since I was 2, now my kiddos love it too :) great place Washroom facilities are deplorable. Probably 20 years old and very very very dirty. For $50 / night one would expect something better. The was the only downside to this park which is otherwise beautiful and within close proximity to a great beach and sanctioned off road dirt bike trails.  It was so overcrowded that it didn't look like camping. Camping sites are so close to each other that I would probably had more privacy if I set up a tent in my backyard. A beach isn't in a walking distance, you actually have to drive ... Great place to camp. Most sites are large and well treed. The beach is a 2 km drive but free to park at with your site permit. The beach is beautiful.  Great family fun. very dirty beach smelly washrooms.not recomnded We enjoyed our stay here for camping over the weekend. Large spots. Routinely patrolled by staff. Convenient power outlets and water taps to drink fresh water. Convenient washrooms and even had a washer/drawer for $2. Well maintained facility. Heavily wooded so sometimes hard to star gaze from your camp.  Beautiful place for relaxing Beautiful beach! Great stretch of a beach on Lake Erie. Easy drive from Toronto. Our family tries to make it here at least once every summer. We usually pay for parking at the lot at the beach, but if you get there early, I think there are free parking spots behind the barrier around the paid parking lot. T.P BABY Worst Provincial Park. Office closes at 4PM. Closed another full day. Horrible noisey drunken family with teens partied till midnight before Rangers did anything. Never coming back. Hate that I have to pay for parking. It would make more sense to have better retail stores the city could collect taxes from. There are certainly enough tourists who would willingly spend while there and keep the economy turning instead of being irritated about the price of parking. Awesome mountain biking destination! One of my favorite beaches in Ontario. Have been to many provincial parks...Turkey point has beautiful large sites surrounded by mature Trees.   Didn't have any trouble with poison ivy or ticks...just wear shoes and stay out of the bushes.  
Beach was beautiful and safe for ... Disappointed because a dark cloud just sat above and rained the entire time This is one of the best beaches in Southern Ontario.  It's nice and sandy and it gradually gets deeper. Great camping experience. Went to the beach not the park the beach was really good! Turkey Point is a great place, but the park sits just outside Turkey Point. Check out the local marina and trailer park for camping. They usually have a few limited spots available with really nice washrooms, etc. There is nothing inside the park other than trails. For zip lining, golfing, beach you gotta go outside. Please read carefully the description of the website ao u don't  have false expectation Lack of access is an issue. Pricey to park if you're only going for a couple hours Nice Beach and Golf course A slice of heaven Amazing beach/cottage area! Great place to spend a long weekend! Very walkable, huge beach! Love fall camping at Turkey Point Less ticky than expected Clean and spacious campgrounds Great park! Amazing place Nice clean beach One of the more beautiful Provincial Park.
 Bring a picnic to make a day out of it. 
Lots of parking but you will have to pay to park in general admission which varies depending upon the time of year.

Make sure to watch for the parking ... The beach looks nice for families, however, I was looking for an off leash beach for my pups. The area for the off leash dog beach was overflooded and the little bit of land dedicated to the pups had families without dogs on it. Was ... Didn't like that the beach was a drive away from the campground but a good option that's close to the city Good boat hire very dirty and alot of pot smoking Just awesome! Close getaway for us. Not the best spot. If u have the time drive down further to longpoint Great beach!  Nice sand.  Shallow warm water.  Wonderful for kids. Great picnic spot for the family and very kid friendly By far one of my favourite beaches! It's very clean and the water is very clear with lots of sandbars. One downside is climbing up the sand dunes with arms full of beach equipment but it's definitely worth it! The beach water was not clean enough No turkeys The park is great, camp sites se had was wide. Only 3 stars because the beach is overcrowded and far away from campgrounds.. And wood was humid I thought the trails were boring... until I hit the right ones. amazing XC Excellent place to spend a day or a weekend, Absolutely great park last time I went was 15+ years ago still the same great location with lotsof things to do, aswell same great service recieved. Would do another trip next year We enjoyed a lot water is clean good beach to be with family and friends This is our third time at the beach and first time camping. We returned here as the beach is good, kid friendly and not rocky. Unfortunately our camping experience here has been the worst. The washrooms by the campsites are extremely ... Great beach Lovely place to spend some time with family on the lake. Beach is quite nice and the advantage of coming to the Turkey point for water sport lovers are the two rental outlets here for seadoo, boats and pontoons. Clean and easy access beaches; my favourite one! I've been going there for years it's a nice Beach a busy Beach at times great place to take your kids Beach day! Drive a Jeep it’s so much better that way If only I could give zero stars I would. We called the evening before we left on our travels with our new trailer friends and kids in tow. The lady on the phone insisted that we be there for 8am to get a spot with electric hookups. When ... Nice beach Clean Beach with Local Arcade Lots of MTB trails. Great place for a long ride and challenge. Was a bit icy and muddy first time. All things considered they are solid trails. Terrain is sandy. It's a compact sand, not the soft loose stuff.  Makes a mess in the car - lay down a blanket.  Looking forward to more rides here.  Very beautiful place to live It's my kinda place... Seadoo, water front, restaurant and more... Nice beach. Easy to commute. Toilet facilities are not great.  great beach Some of the best mountain biking in the province!   The price for hitting the ground...ticks, poison ivy and sand in the chamois!  Rewards....the fastest, funnest, rolling single track.   Free parking, shaded areas of needed. Nice beach.  Super disappointed by this park. My family and I wanted to go to the beach and somewhere new with our 3 year old daughter. We decided to drive from Niagara to Turkey Point beach early in the afternoon. We arrived to find the entire town ... Lovely Sandy beach with clear shallow water fantastic to swim in Enjoyed my experience. Beach is not in the park but about a 5 minute drive. Camping spots are large,  tall trees give good shade  Great beach, shallow Lake Erie, warm water.  Super busy place, go early in the day or you won't get a parking spot. Great chicken wings and beer deals and absolutely brilliant and helpful staff Nice large beach, some picnic tables. Very clean, with washrooms as well.  Nice beach but usually crowfed. Awesome place for family Sites were large in comparison to other parks electrical was close  and the dump and fill stations were newer. Trees were beautiful unfortunately  the showers in the bathrooms are lacking the updates that some of the other parks have had Nice beach & water sports. Disastrous washrooms. Very nice park! Very good. Many chickens for hunting on this one. Pictured here, is my son, Myangus Biif-Harry, sporting the latest in exo-skeletal insectoid fashion. Great private lots for camping, however the beach was kind of murkey.... Awesome beach. Parking was around 14$ in the park lot but was all day and had in and out privileges. There is street parking as well. Not much in the way of food on the main drag but Port Dover is a close enough drive if you're stuck, ... Awesome Beach, great hiking trails and fantastic people Didn't get to the park but the beach is beautiful. Warm water too.  A nice change from going up north to Muskoka. Campsites are not the most private and the washrooms are showing their age.  Beautiful beach on Lake Erie.  Great campground.  Watch out for ticks though, our dog had 4 on him and our daughter got bit by a tick too.   Great park. Clean. Great experience Spent a week here. Very private, lots of trees. And quite.  Always a great place to visit. things to remember this is a provincial park so they do not remove poison oak or ivy so stay out of the bushes. Great staff. Nice location. Bathrooms a bit rough. Beach is quite a trek from the park.  This is a busy, crouded beach. Made more crouded by high water this year it would not be my choice beach.   For a small park with lots of sites, the sites are nicely sized and fairly private. Unfortunately the beach isn't close and you need to drive there.  Nice place for group camping. Great trip Decent beach Incredible views near the water. Great spite for relaxing on the beach or playing in the water. Some of the best mountain biking in Ontario. Over 70km of fast flow trails. Worth the drive.  Grrat place watch out for poision ivey Beautiful place Amazing cycling trail network. One of the best is SW Ontario Great place to go camping,  book in advance waaaay in advance for long weekends,  clean place pretty good price  Toilets are so dirty A great place for a wheelchair bound person to get close to the water. Nice place Nice large campsites, and excellent trials. Perfect for people who have RV's. 
Only downfall is the beach and water is off site and you need to drive. Awesome mtb trails! Great clean sites and close to the beach Some of the best singletrack and cross country trails I've ridden in Ontario. A great day trip for any cycling enthusiast. The beach may be a drive but is totally worth it! Their website says theres fishing but there is not.
 It is $14.50 per car to park. We did not stay bc we wanted to fish. Staff at Turkey point pp said to fish in Port Dover.  Clean and well spaced sites.  Have not camped here but did some mountain biking and it was a lot of fun, though I preferred the trails closer to Eco Point Adventure Tours. Terrible service Nice beach. Nice people.  Good old beach feel and family friendly.  Clean beach, big, and family friendly We went in September so it was quiet, but the campsites were clean, well spaced, spacious, and had decent privacy. Park staff were friendly. Nice park Beautiful place wonderful trails Nice place to chill. Still one of our favorite places to go Been with my father. Really good memories and nothing bonds family members together more than places like this with golfing and fishing! The beach was pretty rocky walking in but was a good place to swim.   Further down the beach, to the right at the t-intersection, great sandy beaches to swim as well! Spacious sites and a surrounded by forest.
On the bad side valted toilets. All the bathrooms and showers need to be replaced. Small amount of space to shoreline but you can find some private areas with very little people surrounding the beachfront  Fantastic mountain bike trails and a really nice park Incredible beach. It's typically quiet and always clean.  This is a beautiful park if you like privacy in the woods and camping in a tent or pop-up trailer with a gang of your friends or your young family. However, it's not an easy park for the novice RV'er. There are narrow roadways and ... Awesome campground and fantastic beach Love it Excellent Went for a friend's bachelor party , stayed the weekend.  The Rangers were nice, would absolutely recommend  Beach is about 1.5 km from campground. Too far away. Good, not too busy. Paid parking. Not many food and drink options. Wonderful place to take a vacation. Quiet and o so freindly and helpful to the disabled  Street parking gets busier in the mid-day. Not enough beach area to play around. A good place to admire Lake Erie. Beach is getting small and sand was full of smoke buts My son and I come back every year. I expected more, a Ranger kept watching me and my fiance and shinning his light in my eyes, we complain and nothing came of it Great family park and beach  Long but narrow beach. Water not too deep not cold. Not very clean tho. Tons of boats n stuff. Pretty crowded on weekend. Paid parking is 14$till 10pm Nice Excellent We recently stayed two nights at the Whipporwill camp ground.

Great place Carolinian Oak Savanah Forests. Killometers of mountain bike trails. Large spacious park exceptionally well treed and lots of private sites. Good trails for hiking apart from mountain bike trails. Complete facilities shower store etc. ... Great provincial park, but a long walk to the beach! Beautiful beach great for a day at the beach Little tuff on people Gorgeous beach, quieter than most popular ones around the area. better than dover, way less crowded Great campsites, and a short drive from the beach means you can enjoy a wide variety of outdoor activities.

Three hiking trails
Great beach in the village of Turkey Point – shallow, buoyed swimming, great for kids.
Marina, restaurants, zip lining, winery all within two kilometres
Group campingSpent a weekend here in 2018. It's a nice park but has a touristy feel to it. It's definitely a park where people go to party as it's so close to the main strip. I'd stay here again for a quick weekend but nothing more as we like the up north experience. The campsite was very spacious, well maintained and moderately private. We were able to see many fireflies at night. Other than the beach which was quite distant outside the park, I didn’t find many attractions or activities within the ... Beautiful park with large sites. Close to a big beach on Lake Erie and wonderful winery's. There are local produce growers and during the summer there is a plethora of fresh things to eat. Turkey Point Provincial Park and village are quaint and small village stretched along the Ontario north shore of Lake Erie one and a half hours west of Hamilton.
Great soft sandy beach, a number of restaurants and eateries and boat ... Turkey Point is a really fun provincial park.  The sites were well maintained and the amenities were very good.

The beach was a bit of a distance from the park itself, and you had to go into town to get to it... which, if you're ... Great place to mountain bike. Good variety of trails. Well marked, maps in the park. Some hills, some flats. Great hiking spot. Different types of forest and terrain, easy to extreme well marked trails. Another fantastic Provincial Park. 
Well maintained and kept clean. 
A Friendly staff that was very accommodating.
The park however has exclusively sold Pepsi Products for years. A change would be nice. I would also like to see better equipped stores throughout the Parks Province wide. This is a beautifull park with beaches, camping, entertainment and sandbar on the beach for good eats.
The water gets organic in high heat periods, but it's clean.
Right on the inner longpoint bay, makes it great for boating.
Highly recommend trying this one. A great park and wonderful forest to stroll around in Great beach... shallow waters... good place to go not much shade Was disappointed when we found out the park wasn't on Lake Erie. No beach without a car. The comfort stations are lacking in cleanliness and need updating. I refused to use the showers. The sites were just okay. Lots of ants in the area. Park was incredibly loud until 2:30 or 3 am both nights we stayed--sleep was impossible. Additionally, the other family we camped with had a site much smaller and much less private than ours but was only $10 less - a larger price difference would have been more realistic for the lack of quality comparison. Such a beautiful place to take your kids. Not overly crowded like most parks and visitors take care in cleaning up. Keeping it beautiful It is very nice cottage country, love the scenery and all the beautiful cottages there. But this place is only good if you are going to be at a cottage or camping ground close to the beach otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it because ... Love the easy access to the beach.  Lots of parking Nice park on the lake with lots of activities for all ages Great spot for one day picnics... The beach is Rocky but clean. Amazing view of the sunset!! Beach here sucks and be careful there is a rip tide. Turkey Point hotel across the street has a great restaurant highly recommended but if you're looking for a good beach I recommend Port Dover over Turkey Point We came here 19 years ago for our honeymoon with our kids and loved it. We decided a couple days ago to sneak away and Turkey Point Provincial park had the perfect spot. Nice amount of privacy, great campfire and everyone out strolling ... Like this park only for its proximity to the beach.sites are very open with no privacy.too much noise and allround sillyness.by younger patrons.should be patrolled better. I'm not a prude but when I camp, I like to enjoy where I am. Park is always clean. The beach is great. Much better than dover.  Have been camping here for 24 years. The staff is always friendly. Sometimes on the weekends it can be a little noisey, but nothing out of hand. The beach can sometimes ... Nice campground.  Wish the beach was closer to the campground though, it's beautiful.  Also, playground didn't really have much for toddlers.  Small other complaint, there really weren't any clearings close by to watch the stars. Washroomsamong the cleanest seen at a provincial park. Group campsite was good. Nearby beach was not walking distance, and the vehicle lineup to get through the single entry point was very long at peak hours. Great place for kids.  Shallow water.  Just wish there were full bathroom facilities as opposed to an upgraded outhouse Turkey Point the lake was awesome. People there were welcome in and great Sea-Doos are great and fun if you ever get a chance to go on one I recommend you do it if you ever get a chance to go to Turkey Point I recommend you do it there's ... Love this campground and the town itself. Beach is beautiful Nice lively beach!  Pull your car up sand-side and enjoy.  Current parking fee is $14.50.  If you're staying at Turkey Point Provincial Park, show your vehicle permit and parking is free. The beach is nice but there are many things that make it not so nice. There isn't much sand space to rest, and the water was dirty with pieces of wood, seaweed etc, so the water was not clear. There were a number of jet skis laying ... I visited the day use beach and I was pleasantly surprised with the maintenance and overall cleanliness. The water was clean and inviting. Amazing place to bring the family !
1km away from this camp site is the beach that has tons of activities for people of all ages !
The camp sites on ""walking stick"" camp grounds aren't as private but we made due!
I reccomend this place for sure ! Went camping here and had a great time! I'd definitely be willing to come back Water is not too rough, just wish they would rake the beach more. Great space to stay for a weekend, short drive or walk to the water! Great place to camp! Best beach in Ontario. Go early as it gets very busy! Very decent beach with cleaner water than port dover Great get away location close enough to the cities but far enough away to escape it all. Great time camping with the family.  Camp sites are small and irregularly shaped. The bathrooms are clean, but in desperate need of repairs and very few and far between. Great Beach a little crowded in the summer. Bring food and drinks because the stores are very expensive. Nice park but farmers keep shooting off bangers to scare the birds from their crops. Starts at 6 a.m. Very loud. Gorgeous beach. Not too busy in off season. Beautiful beach, warm water and decent parking. There are bathrooms and they're decently clean. Turkey point beaches and conservation regions are a great place to visit and camp it's worth the time to go with family or friends when the weather is scorching hot,and the safe swimming zone is marked. The area around the beach is a beautiful countryside. Really peaceful not too busy. need to go early in the morning so that no need to get frustated about parking. Great camping nice and clean but the water is too far away. The beach is somewhat dirty and there are way too many boats and scooters. The water was not very clear. Also, although very long, the beach is not wide so it easily gets crowded on a hot day. Good thing about it is that it has a lot of natural shade. Beautiful spot, great for anyone! It's a great beach 
It's my new go to beach 
See you later Dover Standard provincial park.  Lots of posion ivy and lots of mosquitoes but good sites. A lot of sand makes for dirty camping.  Prefer port Burwell as it is grass. Great place to camp if you are looking for a great place to camp. Nearly 100km in spectacular trails. You do not want to miss out on a chance to ride here. The park attendants aren't very clear on instructions of which campsites to choose from. But very beautiful and very well maintained park. Big camp ground in great condition and great location in south west Ontario. Easy to advanced trails at your door and one Kilometre to the beach Beautiful beach and clean water with ample free public parking. The beach is nice and not too crowded, the jetski’s were fun Our Summer is never complete without beach day at Turkey Point! Nice beach, no parking unless you get there early! Lucked out because it rained all of this weekend but the campsites are good for tents or trailers. Would definitely recommend for a weekend camping trip Fantastic there  I loved the park.i recommend  to go there camping Long Point is the best beach in the area. Turkey Point is great for boating, and beach / boating. Nice spot that's no overly busy. Sand in places are gravelly Love Turkey Point. Camping is great, the beach is beautiful and the jet ski's are awesome at Waveline. Shopping along the beach is outrageous. 50 bucks for an umbrella and sunscreen.  Beach is nice . I enjoyed it Beautiful park! Beach is not connected to main park body but is a 5 minute drive. Lovely shallow water whittington the buoys. Beach gets very busy and doesn't have a lot of cover, so arrive early and bring a sunscreen, an umbrella, or a ... It's about what you expect from a Provincial Park on the lake. I thought that was a little pricey but it's a popular place. Play sand on the beach a few twigs but again it's on the lake it's expected Nice little area The place is absolutely filled with poison ivy and the bathrooms are horrific. We camp all over Ontario and this is by far the worst campground I have ever been to. The bathrooms are worse then most port-a-potties I've seen. There is no ... This is not really a good place to camp considering there are other places. I got an ear infection from the water there where people swim. There are also lots of poison ivy there so it is dangerous for kids. My friend got a tick bite ... It's a nice beach but small so it can get crowded on hot days, the sand has alot of twigs and leaves as does the water's edge but once u go past the edge where its dirty the water isnt as bad. Lots of boats on the area and jet skis. The local stores beachside are a bit overpriced. Ok for a short visit. Good beach - shallow so expect marine matter in the water but otherwise nice The beach was more of an ashtray 🤮. Not sure what was worse the thousands of cigarette butts or the overcrowding. Personally I enjoy a clean and more spacious beach day Beautiful spot. Some non paying parking available further west of the point. Nice place to relax but avoid  long weekend Very good Days coming parking 
Eating and barbecue Motel fishing boat rental place Tropical experience right here in Ontario awesome place! Amazing beach and the mini golf was so much fun! Excellent single track mountain bike trails, especially for Southern Ontario. There is a very well maintained network of trails for the mountain bike novice or enthusiast. There are maps at every junction with all trails mapped out with ... Beautiful beach great place to camp or just go for the day. Great bike trails. Will be returning for warm weather rides. Great place for camping and not far to the beach Beautiful place, clean trails to hike on! The staff is awesome and the protection of our parks is very important Great family park in a very natural setting. Great playground, golfcourse, beach, trails. Beach was a little dirty but overall a good trip! Parking is a little expensive Great spot to go for some beach fun. Not a ton of space for large groups. The best place to go gor camping. I like to go there often Great place for get away This is one of the good old parks. Old facilities, average - low privacy of the sites, absence of proper park store (only small store at the entrance). This place has ticks so beware . Popular for trailers. I also found it popular for youth, so expect it to get noisy and guards will not do much until 11pm. Beautiful park, bathrooms where clean and so much hot water I had to turn it down. Great park.  Always sites available. Great place and friendly staff. Visit during the ""off-season if you want some personal space on the beach sand. Awesome place to go mountain biking. One of the best places in Ontario. It is single track heaven. About 75km of single track. The trails are sandy and drain better then anywhere else. An awesome place for your fat bike year round. clear water open space beautiful view Rude employees and very disorganized. Poision ivy everywhere and the beach is in terrible condition. Would never go again. Waste of money. Excelent place for enjoy a camping and a wonderful beach with the family!!! Mountain bike trails are excellent.  Well marked out and lots of challenges. Fun and clean very nice for family's Fantastic beach my family and I love it! Nice beach in a small community. A great beach that is close to home. Lots of local activities, mountain biking is spectacular😀 Fun trails and quick drying this time of year for MTB. Awesome bike trails! Parking was a problem , beaches  were nice, party atmosphere Nice wooded campgrounds close to Lake Erie and a wide variety of activity I am so close to wanting to live there. Turkey point is a clean beach and a quite not very crowded place. Having a great time with my family! Friendly staff, nice campgrounds, and prices are more than fair for wood or ice & such, there's stores within 20 minutes if you need random stuff. Would definitely come back again and will recommend others to come!  This beach is Awesome. It is a clean beach. There is all ages of people that go there & it's a pretty quiet beach. I would recommend... it is definitely  more than a 5 star. This is such a nice beach and lots to do if you drive around. Food, jet skiing, ice cream, boating. Depending on where you stay, you can walk to some of these.
By main beach is All You Can Eat breakfast! 
The people are so nice and we always enjoy coming up! Not the best provincial park I have visited. Do yourself a favour and drive additional 15 minutes to long point PP Parking is close to the beach, makes it easy to take little kids Camp spots pretty tight for motorhome Great  time  with  friends and family I recently visited this park with my family and we had a great time. We were especially impressed by the large sites. Beach is close by with parking for permit holders. Overall a nice park. Nice Sunday drive to an awesome destinations.  Rewarded with beautiful beaches. Trail riding is awesome here This was a nice family oriented public beach located across from cottages.  The beach is sandy and the water bed is on the rockier side but shallow and marked.  Along the road there are a few shops to pick up beach toys and paraphernalia and one with a patio.  Not sure about food or drinks as i did not go into the shops.   I loved camping here. We camped primarily through the week- once Friday night arrived, the park got much louder which changed the feel of the trip. Overall, great experience. other than park it is a great beach Had a great time at the Beach. This park was the one place my friends and I could count on for a place to stay in our spontaneous travels through Norfolk County (Everything else was booked up for the weekend). And to our surprise, the park and campsites are very nice ... I loved this area. The nature hiking trails are very scenic and the town is beautiful. Great camping spot for anyone trying to get out of the city but not having to go very far. Kiddy land! Loved thus place since I was 2, now my kiddos love it too :) great place Washroom facilities are deplorable. Probably 20 years old and very very very dirty. For $50 / night one would expect something better. The was the only downside to this park which is otherwise beautiful and within close proximity to a great beach and sanctioned off road dirt bike trails.  It was so overcrowded that it didn't look like camping. Camping sites are so close to each other that I would probably had more privacy if I set up a tent in my backyard. A beach isn't in a walking distance, you actually have to drive ... Great place to camp. Most sites are large and well treed. The beach is a 2 km drive but free to park at with your site permit. The beach is beautiful.  Great family fun. very dirty beach smelly washrooms.not recomnded We enjoyed our stay here for camping over the weekend. Large spots. Routinely patrolled by staff. Convenient power outlets and water taps to drink fresh water. Convenient washrooms and even had a washer/drawer for $2. Well maintained facility. Heavily wooded so sometimes hard to star gaze from your camp.  Beautiful place for relaxing Beautiful beach! Great stretch of a beach on Lake Erie. Easy drive from Toronto. Our family tries to make it here at least once every summer. We usually pay for parking at the lot at the beach, but if you get there early, I think there are free parking spots behind the barrier around the paid parking lot. T.P BABY Worst Provincial Park. Office closes at 4PM. Closed another full day. Horrible noisey drunken family with teens partied till midnight before Rangers did anything. Never coming back. Hate that I have to pay for parking. It would make more sense to have better retail stores the city could collect taxes from. There are certainly enough tourists who would willingly spend while there and keep the economy turning instead of being irritated about the price of parking. Awesome mountain biking destination! One of my favorite beaches in Ontario. Have been to many provincial parks...Turkey point has beautiful large sites surrounded by mature Trees.   Didn't have any trouble with poison ivy or ticks...just wear shoes and stay out of the bushes.  
Beach was beautiful and safe for ... Disappointed because a dark cloud just sat above and rained the entire time This is one of the best beaches in Southern Ontario.  It's nice and sandy and it gradually gets deeper. Great camping experience. Went to the beach not the park the beach was really good! Turkey Point is a great place, but the park sits just outside Turkey Point. Check out the local marina and trailer park for camping. They usually have a few limited spots available with really nice washrooms, etc. There is nothing inside the park other than trails. For zip lining, golfing, beach you gotta go outside. Please read carefully the description of the website ao u don't  have false expectation Lack of access is an issue. Pricey to park if you're only going for a couple hours Nice Beach and Golf course A slice of heaven Amazing beach/cottage area! Great place to spend a long weekend! Very walkable, huge beach! Love fall camping at Turkey Point Less ticky than expected Clean and spacious campgrounds Great park! Amazing place Nice clean beach One of the more beautiful Provincial Park.
 Bring a picnic to make a day out of it. 
Lots of parking but you will have to pay to park in general admission which varies depending upon the time of year.

Make sure to watch for the parking ... The beach looks nice for families, however, I was looking for an off leash beach for my pups. The area for the off leash dog beach was overflooded and the little bit of land dedicated to the pups had families without dogs on it. Was ... Didn't like that the beach was a drive away from the campground but a good option that's close to the city Good boat hire very dirty and alot of pot smoking Just awesome! Close getaway for us. Not the best spot. If u have the time drive down further to longpoint Great beach!  Nice sand.  Shallow warm water.  Wonderful for kids. Great picnic spot for the family and very kid friendly By far one of my favourite beaches! It's very clean and the water is very clear with lots of sandbars. One downside is climbing up the sand dunes with arms full of beach equipment but it's definitely worth it! The beach water was not clean enough No turkeys The park is great, camp sites se had was wide. Only 3 stars because the beach is overcrowded and far away from campgrounds.. And wood was humid I thought the trails were boring... until I hit the right ones. amazing XC Excellent place to spend a day or a weekend, Absolutely great park last time I went was 15+ years ago still the same great location with lotsof things to do, aswell same great service recieved. Would do another trip next year We enjoyed a lot water is clean good beach to be with family and friends This is our third time at the beach and first time camping. We returned here as the beach is good, kid friendly and not rocky. Unfortunately our camping experience here has been the worst. The washrooms by the campsites are extremely ... Great beach Lovely place to spend some time with family on the lake. Beach is quite nice and the advantage of coming to the Turkey point for water sport lovers are the two rental outlets here for seadoo, boats and pontoons. Clean and easy access beaches; my favourite one! I've been going there for years it's a nice Beach a busy Beach at times great place to take your kids Beach day! Drive a Jeep it’s so much better that way If only I could give zero stars I would. We called the evening before we left on our travels with our new trailer friends and kids in tow. The lady on the phone insisted that we be there for 8am to get a spot with electric hookups. When ... Nice beach Clean Beach with Local Arcade Lots of MTB trails. Great place for a long ride and challenge. Was a bit icy and muddy first time. All things considered they are solid trails. Terrain is sandy. It's a compact sand, not the soft loose stuff.  Makes a mess in the car - lay down a blanket.  Looking forward to more rides here.  Very beautiful place to live It's my kinda place... Seadoo, water front, restaurant and more... Nice beach. Easy to commute. Toilet facilities are not great.  great beach Some of the best mountain biking in the province!   The price for hitting the ground...ticks, poison ivy and sand in the chamois!  Rewards....the fastest, funnest, rolling single track.   Free parking, shaded areas of needed. Nice beach.  Super disappointed by this park. My family and I wanted to go to the beach and somewhere new with our 3 year old daughter. We decided to drive from Niagara to Turkey Point beach early in the afternoon. We arrived to find the entire town ... Lovely Sandy beach with clear shallow water fantastic to swim in Enjoyed my experience. Beach is not in the park but about a 5 minute drive. Camping spots are large,  tall trees give good shade  Great beach, shallow Lake Erie, warm water.  Super busy place, go early in the day or you won't get a parking spot. Great chicken wings and beer deals and absolutely brilliant and helpful staff Nice large beach, some picnic tables. Very clean, with washrooms as well.  Nice beach but usually crowfed. Awesome place for family Sites were large in comparison to other parks electrical was close  and the dump and fill stations were newer. Trees were beautiful unfortunately  the showers in the bathrooms are lacking the updates that some of the other parks have had Nice beach & water sports. Disastrous washrooms. Very nice park! Very good. Many chickens for hunting on this one. Pictured here, is my son, Myangus Biif-Harry, sporting the latest in exo-skeletal insectoid fashion. Great private lots for camping, however the beach was kind of murkey.... Awesome beach. Parking was around 14$ in the park lot but was all day and had in and out privileges. There is street parking as well. Not much in the way of food on the main drag but Port Dover is a close enough drive if you're stuck, ... Awesome Beach, great hiking trails and fantastic people Didn't get to the park but the beach is beautiful. Warm water too.  A nice change from going up north to Muskoka. Campsites are not the most private and the washrooms are showing their age.  Beautiful beach on Lake Erie.  Great campground.  Watch out for ticks though, our dog had 4 on him and our daughter got bit by a tick too.   Great park. Clean. Great experience Spent a week here. Very private, lots of trees. And quite.  Always a great place to visit. things to remember this is a provincial park so they do not remove poison oak or ivy so stay out of the bushes. Great staff. Nice location. Bathrooms a bit rough. Beach is quite a trek from the park.  This is a busy, crouded beach. Made more crouded by high water this year it would not be my choice beach.

Only downfall is the beach and water is off site and you need to drive. Awesome mtb trails! Great clean sites and close to the beach Some of the best singletrack and cross country trails I've ridden in Ontario. A great day trip for any cycling enthusiast. The beach may be a drive but is totally worth it! Their website says theres fishing but there is not.
 It is $14.50 per car to park. We did not stay bc we wanted to fish. Staff at Turkey point pp said to fish in Port Dover.  Clean and well spaced sites.  Have not camped here but did some mountain biking and it was a lot of fun, though I preferred the trails closer to Eco Point Adventure Tours. Terrible service Nice beach. Nice people.  Good old beach feel and family friendly.  Clean beach, big, and family friendly We went in September so it was quiet, but the campsites were clean, well spaced, spacious, and had decent privacy. Park staff were friendly. Nice park Beautiful place wonderful trails Nice place to chill. Still one of our favorite places to go Been with my father.

On the bad side valted toilets. All the bathrooms and showers need to be replaced. Small amount of space to shoreline but you can find some private areas with very little people surrounding the beachfront  Fantastic mountain bike trails and a really nice park Incredible beach. It's typically quiet and always clean.  This is a beautiful park if you like privacy in the woods and camping in a tent or pop-up trailer with a gang of your friends or your young family.

Awesome campground and fantastic beach Love it Excellent Went for a friend's bachelor party , stayed the weekend.  The Rangers were nice, would absolutely recommend  Beach is about 1.5 km from campground. Too far away. Good, not too busy. Paid parking. Not many food and drink options. Wonderful place to take a vacation. Quiet and o so freindly and helpful to the disabled  Street parking gets busier in the mid-day. Not enough beach area to play around. A good place to admire Lake Erie. Beach is getting small and sand was full of smoke buts My son and I come back every year. I expected more, a Ranger kept watching me and my fiance and shinning his light in my eyes, we complain and nothing came of it Great family park and beach  Long but narrow beach. Water not too deep not cold. Not very clean tho. Tons of boats n stuff. Pretty crowded on weekend. Paid parking is 14$till 10pm Nice Excellent We recently stayed two nights at the Whipporwill camp ground.  The camp sites are really dusty,  so you feel dirty the whole time you're here and there was only two showers in the vicinity, which there was always a line up for. Also ... Great place Carolinian Oak Savanah Forests. Killometers of mountain bike trails. Large spacious park exceptionally well treed and lots of private sites. Good trails for hiking apart from mountain bike trails. Complete facilities shower store etc. ... Great provincial park, but a long walk to the beach! Beautiful beach great for a day at the beach Little tuff on people Gorgeous beach, quieter than most popular ones around the area. better than dover, way less crowded Great campsites, and a short drive from the beach means you can enjoy a wide variety of outdoor activities.

Very private. Will be back again Had a good time, sites were reasonably spaced out. Very good place to go ,you can bring your boat and fishing,very good views at the campsite This was one of our favorite campgrounds up until around 2015 when whomever was in charge decided to designate some camping sites as seasonal campsites. this is nothing more than a way to make a profit at the expense of regular campers. ... Love it best place around for scenery and camping Well maintained. And security is always near. Love this place. Clean and well maintained Nice play ground. Nice activities such as canoeing, kayaking and hiking. Nice place to swim for family and to do BBQ.
The bad: dogs are allowed to enter and to swim with you!
The wc are small and there is only 4 for the beach Great place to camp so close to home Nice place to stroll Very nice, very clean, great beach and kid friendly. Campground was good (but not as nice as some of the other provincial parks in southeastern Ontario).  If you have a trailer longer than about 25 feet, you'll want to take extra caution with some sharp turns through the campground ... Pretty sweet spot for short stay. Absolutely loved my stay there.

- not far from Montreal (1 hour)
- Staffs are really nice and ready to help
- showers are ok
Cons:
- wash rooms are not clean often and really dirt
- beach are small It was a foggy morning.  But everything cleared up quickly.  A great place to explore on a long road trip. Although I only stayed one night I was pleased with the experience Nice camping sites but some washrooms are a bit hard to get to when it rains because of the mud. Beach is nice and staff very friendly. We stayed here a few times, we enjoy the radio free campsites because we have young children. Very nice place for picnic and camping They were closed.  At least the access road was plowed and usable by big trucks for a rest stop. Too crowded, not too many people swimming. Very nice site...campground superb Its a good place where u can go with my dog i will come back 🐩🐩 Super awesome place to camp Great place to bring the family. Beautifully maintained camp grounds, friendly staff and basic amenities near by. If you need the security of a convenience store while camping this is a great place. We like the Portage side of the park. Far from the beach, but it is usually very private and quiet.  Very good place to unwind Nice space. Lots are close together but easy to navigate and get to the washroom. Nice beach, wasn't crowded. Lots of families and plenty of playgrounds. Great place ..camping. .fishing .. Nice park on the lake I always enjoy watching the stars from that spot. There are a lot water hemlock weeds growing in certain parts of the park Quiet, large sites, very clean showers and rest rooms. Dog friendly sites,nice beach I caught
A FISH

FISH Favorite Loved their beach!!!! The camp grounds are nicely seperated by bushes too so your neighbors don't intrude on your space :) but last visit, the toilets flooded for over a day. But hey, sh** happens! A pipe burst and that's that! The staff is super sweet and informative too! Beautiful nature and a place were you may go with your family and friends for a nice BBQ. Great place to relax  and get away.  I liked the secluded sites. We have been to this park several times to camp and we enjoy it every time! Had to leave a day early from our 7 day stay. Showed up at the gate @2:30 to find out that noon was the cut off time to get a refund. Nowhere on the refund paper did it say that noon was the cut off time. We enjoy provincial parks alot ... Just didn't like all the catapillers . Great camping area, beautiful nature, nice beaches, a to go place for camping or a 1 day BBQ with family and friends I love this campground.Quiet enough that the kids can bike around. Nice enough beaches. Clean enough bathrooms. But I found two ticks on my dog when we got home. No fault of the park though.  Popular with young campers looking for a ... Great place to go to the beach as a family if you're looking for a quiet spot. Lots of picnic tables and the facilities are clean. Very cheap breakfast as well.

One problem that came up for the first time is the presence of geese who leaves ""messes."" Other than that, great place for a day in the sun. Beautiful provincial park. The site was big and clean. We hope to visit again soon. Dog camping sector is wonderful Nice beaches but the camp sites are pretty close together and the price was higher than ideal.  Private nice clean campgrounds.
Too strict and power tripping rangers. We have to whisper at the campfire because if we talk normally they warn us to be quiet.
A bit pricey compared to other parks Great site and amenities! No raccoons seen! Big plus! Great camping area in the provincial Park on the sides of the Ottawa River and the Quebec border with Big Lots A very large and picturesque park that has many campsites and wonderful views of the Ottawa river. Also close to the Carillon dam and lock which is very popular with boaters. A must place to visit if you love nature and camping. You have 3 different camp grounds. And in the middle of this place..you have 2 big beaches and a canteen for snacks... Great provincial park. Very clean and pretty. Not much is in walking distance though and there were quite a few bugs but only at night.  Good camping ground. Nice small beach, bring your BBQ, limited tables but big space for picnic  Amazing Park so close to Ottawa and Montreal!

This is the 3rd year we have gone there, but this year we went later in the year. In the month of September. But we had a trailer and we ended up taking a site with an electrical outlet. So ... Very private ,great camp site , large beach friendly staff  great family vacation spot Amazing and relaxing camping ground and the privacy is good.  The beach, walking path and shower/toilets are very clean.  The staff were helpful and nice. Dog friendly. Unfortunately my dog got bitten by a tick:(
We came in May, there were a lot of mosquitos and pollen.
We'll be back for sure. Big outdoor zone full of wild life roomy lot's of privacy The park is great but the staff are so amazing they are ready to help you in any way that they can. i recommend this park to every body looking for a beautiful camping experience. Thank's a lot guys see you again soon. Pretty good park, the fire woods are expensive and hard to start. Excellent site and nice location. Well maintained. Really not bad for as close to Ottawa ... only thing is that you dont have lots of place that has three services but aside that really nice and nice beach Good times! Great provincial campground. Very clean, friendly staff and well maintained.  My favourite place to go car camping. Facilities are decent, staff has always been attentive and friendly, and there are towns nearby if you're in a pinch and the camp store doesn't have what you need. Really big Park, all styles of camping available from small tent with private lot to full services for big RV s. Very good Very very small beach. But you'll see snakes and tiks. Ita nothing more than a little grassed field with bbq's but nothing more. Plus for nothing you have to pay to get in. Relaxing and private. Extremely quiet and peaceful park.  The sites that I was were very well space to provide ample privacy.   Love it! Will be back for sure! Beautiful park with wonderfully large sites. 
Swimming area are standard. We did not like the water.  Nice place for a family picnic. Lots of aquatic activities and a decent snack bar. Somewhat expensive entrance fee if only spending the day.  Nice place to camp in nice weather you do it Great little provincial park located on the Ottawa River. Great park.  Good privacy and amenities. A great camping site with a separate day beach. Appropriate for families and young couples alike  Easy park to reach from Ottawa for a quick overnight trip. Too close to the highway for serious campers, but a good spot for car camping. Good place for picnic with a fair entrance fee. Exclle nice close place to camp. feels like you're on vacation. love it! Great location as it's close to Montreal. Lots of sites to choose from. My only concern is the proximity to the highway which can be heard anywhere in the park.  Nice campground with some very large and private camping sites. The bathrooms are a bit old and far away in some sections of the campsite, but otherwise completely acceptable.  Nice park for walking around and enjoyin some quiet time. However, if you drive up from Montreal you might prefer going to Oka for closer, nicer and cheaper provincial park. :) for people who really prioritize quiet over everything else, Voyageur is the spot Great park with nice little paths Beautiful experience camping with kids and friends Lots to do, private camping which is nice. Beach and boat rentals and lots of hiking to do.  Wildlife to see as well. Clean provincial park, nice campsites, beaches and trails Nice and close to Montreal, can be a bit crowded on a sunny weekend. Limited hiking trails that are not very well maintained nor used, but has several good beaches and water activities.  Lovely park for Camping or day trip Beautiful location! Expensive daily rates. Beautiful park with great camping sites.  Super friendly staff awesome park! Fireflies! Camping park that allows dogs and has two beaches, one that also accepts dogs.
My dog loves to spend time there. Simple yet sweet. Nice beach for an afternoon in the sun. Lovely big park.   Great camping. Great place well organized Beautiful Park.

If you have a trailer longer than about 25 feet, you'll want to take extra caution with some sharp turns through the campground ... Pretty sweet spot for short stay. Absolutely loved my stay there. Too bad about the fire ban. This place is VERY clean. Love that. Lawns are well manicured, camping grounds are very clean and well looked after. I saw several rangers out and about everywhere keeping the grounds clean and ready to help with anything and I also saw ... Beautifull park..friendly employees Pros: 
- not far from Montreal (1 hour)
- Staffs are really nice and ready to help
- showers are ok
Cons:
- wash rooms are not clean often and really dirt
- beach are small It was a foggy morning.  But everything cleared up quickly.  A great place to explore on a long road trip. Although I only stayed one night I was pleased with the experience Nice camping sites but some washrooms are a bit hard to get to when it rains because of the mud. Beach is nice and staff very friendly. We stayed here a few times, we enjoy the radio free campsites because we have young children. Very nice place for picnic and camping They were closed.  At least the access road was plowed and usable by big trucks for a rest stop. Too crowded, not too many people swimming. Very nice site...campground superb Its a good place where u can go with my dog i will come back 🐩🐩 Super awesome place to camp Great place to bring the family. Beautifully maintained camp grounds, friendly staff and basic amenities near by. If you need the security of a convenience store while camping this is a great place. We like the Portage side of the park. Far from the beach, but it is usually very private and quiet.  Very good place to unwind Nice space. Lots are close together but easy to navigate and get to the washroom. Nice beach, wasn't crowded. Lots of families and plenty of playgrounds. Great place ..camping. .fishing .. Nice park on the lake I always enjoy watching the stars from that spot. There are a lot water hemlock weeds growing in certain parts of the park Quiet, large sites, very clean showers and rest rooms. Dog friendly sites,nice beach I caught
A FISH

FISH Favorite Loved their beach!!!! The camp grounds are nicely seperated by bushes too so your neighbors don't intrude on your space :) but last visit, the toilets flooded for over a day. But hey, sh** happens! A pipe burst and that's that! The staff is super sweet and informative too! Beautiful nature and a place were you may go with your family and friends for a nice BBQ. Great place to relax  and get away.  I liked the secluded sites. We have been to this park several times to camp and we enjoy it every time! Had to leave a day early from our 7 day stay. Showed up at the gate @2:30 to find out that noon was the cut off time to get a refund. Nowhere on the refund paper did it say that noon was the cut off time. We enjoy provincial parks alot ... Just didn't like all the catapillers . Great camping area, beautiful nature, nice beaches, a to go place for camping or a 1 day BBQ with family and friends I love this campground.Quiet enough that the kids can bike around. Nice enough beaches. Clean enough bathrooms. But I found two ticks on my dog when we got home. No fault of the park though.  Popular with young campers looking for a ... Great place to go to the beach as a family if you're looking for a quiet spot. Lots of picnic tables and the facilities are clean. Very cheap breakfast as well.

One problem that came up for the first time is the presence of geese who leaves ""messes."" Other than that, great place for a day in the sun. Beautiful provincial park. The site was big and clean. We hope to visit again soon. Dog camping sector is wonderful Nice beaches but the camp sites are pretty close together and the price was higher than ideal.  Private nice clean campgrounds.
Too strict and power tripping rangers. We have to whisper at the campfire because if we talk normally they warn us to be quiet.
A bit pricey compared to other parks Great site and amenities! No raccoons seen! Big plus! Great camping area in the provincial Park on the sides of the Ottawa River and the Quebec border with Big Lots A very large and picturesque park that has many campsites and wonderful views of the Ottawa river. Also close to the Carillon dam and lock which is very popular with boaters. A must place to visit if you love nature and camping. You have 3 different camp grounds. And in the middle of this place..you have 2 big beaches and a canteen for snacks... Great provincial park. Very clean and pretty. Not much is in walking distance though and there were quite a few bugs but only at night.  Good camping ground. Nice small beach, bring your BBQ, limited tables but big space for picnic  Amazing Park so close to Ottawa and Montreal!

This is the 3rd year we have gone there, but this year we went later in the year. In the month of September. But we had a trailer and we ended up taking a site with an electrical outlet. So ... Very private ,great camp site , large beach friendly staff  great family vacation spot Amazing and relaxing camping ground and the privacy is good.  The beach, walking path and shower/toilets are very clean.  The staff were helpful and nice. Dog friendly. Unfortunately my dog got bitten by a tick:(
We came in May, there were a lot of mosquitos and pollen.
We'll be back for sure. Big outdoor zone full of wild life roomy lot's of privacy The park is great but the staff are so amazing they are ready to help you in any way that they can. i recommend this park to every body looking for a beautiful camping experience. Thank's a lot guys see you again soon. Pretty good park, the fire woods are expensive and hard to start. Excellent site and nice location. Well maintained. Really not bad for as close to Ottawa ... only thing is that you dont have lots of place that has three services but aside that really nice and nice beach Good times! Great provincial campground. Very clean, friendly staff and well maintained.  My favourite place to go car camping. Facilities are decent, staff has always been attentive and friendly, and there are towns nearby if you're in a pinch and the camp store doesn't have what you need. Really big Park, all styles of camping available from small tent with private lot to full services for big RV s. Very good Very very small beach. But you'll see snakes and tiks. Ita nothing more than a little grassed field with bbq's but nothing more. Plus for nothing you have to pay to get in. Relaxing and private. Extremely quiet and peaceful park.  The sites that I was were very well space to provide ample privacy.   Love it! Will be back for sure! Beautiful park with wonderfully large sites. 
Swimming area are standard. We did not like the water.  Nice place for a family picnic. Lots of aquatic activities and a decent snack bar. Somewhat expensive entrance fee if only spending the day.  Nice place to camp in nice weather you do it Great little provincial park located on the Ottawa River. Great park.  Good privacy and amenities. A great camping site with a separate day beach. Appropriate for families and young couples alike  Easy park to reach from Ottawa for a quick overnight trip. Too close to the highway for serious campers, but a good spot for car camping. Good place for picnic with a fair entrance fee. Exclle nice close place to camp. feels like you're on vacation. love it! Great location as it's close to Montreal. Lots of sites to choose from. My only concern is the proximity to the highway which can be heard anywhere in the park.  Nice campground with some very large and private camping sites. The bathrooms are a bit old and far away in some sections of the campsite, but otherwise completely acceptable.  Nice park for walking around and enjoyin some quiet time. However, if you drive up from Montreal you might prefer going to Oka for closer, nicer and cheaper provincial park. :) for people who really prioritize quiet over everything else, Voyageur is the spot Great park with nice little paths Beautiful experience camping with kids and friends Lots to do, private camping which is nice. Beach and boat rentals and lots of hiking to do.  Wildlife to see as well. Clean provincial park, nice campsites, beaches and trails Nice and close to Montreal, can be a bit crowded on a sunny weekend. Limited hiking trails that are not very well maintained nor used, but has several good beaches and water activities.  Lovely park for Camping or day trip Beautiful location! Expensive daily rates. Beautiful park with great camping sites.  Super friendly staff awesome park! Fireflies! Camping park that allows dogs and has two beaches, one that also accepts dogs.
My dog loves to spend time there. Simple yet sweet. Nice beach for an afternoon in the sun. Lovely big park.   Great camping. Great place well organized Beautiful Park. Great place for camping Nice place Nice park but the facilities could be a lot cleaner.  I love camper 3 day boot and he family Best camping grounds around.

Wasaga Beach is the first provincial park in Canada to be awarded the “Blue Flag” designation for its banks management efforts under the international environmental standards. For more information, visit www.BlueFlag.ca 
This natural area of ​​6.8 hectares protects wildlife habitat and nesting shorebirds, including the Piping Plover, which is endangered.

Live bands are common for Saturday during the day and police do patrol often to … Amazing beach with lots of bars and stores along the strip. Well worth the trip. Clear water beach with great sand, not rocky.   One of the few beaches in Ontario that I am comfortable not wearing water shoes in the water. Stays shallow for a good distance so was perfect for my 2 1/2 year old. Very large beach and … Awesome, the venue was fun, tons of parking and all the little stores and stops were interesting and inviting. nice long beach if willing to walk along a bit you will find a spot not too crowded. going during the week day it is less busy nice shallow water is great for young kids lots of space people are not bumping into each other. parking is expensive as is the food. Lots of beautiful nature cant go wrong. Canada dayyyy is a bless there Best beach in Ontario, sandy white beach. No rocks, perfect for kids. You can walk and walk and still the water won’t cover then for a while. Beach 1 and 2 are the more popular ones. Parking is 15$ a day. Beach 6 was very enjoyable, the water stays shallow a good way out, great for kids. Beach 1 had a few shops and a very hot Tim Horton's. $5 all day parking was pretty nice. Would recommend for a nice day trip or weekend beach getaway with friends or family. Excellent beach. Great times !! Tourists' attractions have grown making it amazing to spend more than a weekend getaway Canada Day 2018. 
Absolutely stunning beautiful place. 
Unbelievably busy but what do you expect on a 40+ degree weather on a long weekend.
Many beach areas, ( 6 I think) some areas just sand sun and water  Beach area 1 is packed with … Always loved Wasaga growing up. Good place to bring your motor boat. Good fishing along the river. Too many crowds these days, but if you get a quiet area. It's a perfect place to go. If you have a dog, then this is the beach for you. Beach area 3 has a section for people that has dogs. The dogs must be on the leash at all times and you have to be in between 2 posts. It can get packed pretty quickly. The people are a … Great place for a family beach day. You don't need to bring much and the water is awesome for young ones. Very shallow for a long way out. There is plenty of very cheap parking if you go across the street, don't bother with the central … It’s a nice place. Probably best area for swimming in Wasaga. 
Boat launch is there on the River side. Very wide. 
Huge parking area. We go three to four times in summer to Wasaga Beach. We head straight to Beach Area 1 which is more family oriented and sandwiched between the river and the beach. Plenty of washrooms and parking make this place a hit. Loved it in October the bathrooms were open but nothing else except LCBO and one or 2 stores open. Lay on beach for hours. Unfortunately the sand fleas were bad,need to spray the beach so many little kids there. Very busy beach and very crowded. There was barely any room to sit on the beach or swim in the water. The water was full of seaweed and other gunk that you have to wade through. Lots of cool attractions though, there was a ferris wheel, … Had great day here with family and friends. Didn't want to leave. I think we were on beach 2. Loved the beach! The water was a bit cold at first but you get used to it after a few minutes. The waves were relatively calm and the beach clean. I would love to go again! Parking was atrocious. The amount of cars to the parking spaces are heavily disproportionate. Even the lots were full. 

When I went there, the place was jam packed. Perhaps I went midday and by then so many folks had taken up the places … Good place to spend holidays with your family, lots of attractions and clean water beach Great for Salmon then Rainbow Trout fishing Great place for family or any age group. Friendly staff. Very clean. Nice shops and the food was great too! Beach 1 is always so  crowded but other than that im impressed.  Not much garbage. Well looked after. You have to pay for parking coins or credit only Nice place to visit. Just not on a long weekend. Took an hour to find a place to park. People block the view of the water with their huge tents and umbrellas. In the water, people bring their big floats and walk backwards into other people. How rude! Great place to spend a summer weekend. A great place to spend a summer day. I suggest parking in one of the local lots as they most charge $5 for parking rather than $20 at the parks lot. Best beach in Ontario. Feels like Miami Beach’s. Don’t have alcohol on beach side, it’s against law. Police caught me, I was lucky that they gave just warning. We had a great time on the beach and the atmosphere was amazing.  The down fall was the rent a cop smelling people's drinks.  I think that was a little much.  We had a great time. Went for an afternoon,  it was okay.  Please note there is two parks and beach access.  Go early for large families since picnic tables are limited, if you are looking for shade Good place to spend a day. Could be crowded in season weekends. Beautiful beach and a perfect day...i just hope there could be more municipal employees keeping an eye on litterbugs The dog park beach is awesome! Thank you for allowing us to bring our dogs to beach 3!!! Great beaches.  Clean and well maintained.

Boat launch is there on the River side. Very wide. 
Huge parking area. We go three to four times in summer to Wasaga Beach. We head straight to Beach Area 1 which is more family oriented and sandwiched between the river and the beach. Plenty of washrooms and parking make this place a hit. Loved it in October the bathrooms were open but nothing else except LCBO and one or 2 stores open. Lay on beach for hours. Unfortunately the sand fleas were bad,need to spray the beach so many little kids there. Very busy beach and very crowded. There was barely any room to sit on the beach or swim in the water.

You have to pay for parking coins or credit only Nice place to visit. Just not on a long weekend. Took an hour to find a place to park. People block the view of the water with their huge tents and umbrellas. In the water, people bring their big floats and walk backwards into other people. How rude! Great place to spend a summer weekend. A great place to spend a summer day. I suggest parking in one of the local lots as they most charge $5 for parking rather than $20 at the parks lot. Best beach in Ontario. Feels like Miami Beach’s. Don’t have alcohol on beach side, it’s against law. Police caught me, I was lucky that they gave just warning. We had a great time on the beach and the atmosphere was amazing.  The down fall was the rent a cop smelling people's drinks.  I think that was a little much.  We had a great time.
