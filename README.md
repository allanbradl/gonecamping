# Gone Camping

## Problem
There are over 600 campgrounds in Ontario and more than 0.5 million campsite bookings annually. However, the search process of good campgrounds is inefficient and time-consuming. When campers need to find similar alternatives or explore new ones, they need to decide from 50-80 campground features and read hundreds of reviews.

## Solution
“Gone Camping!” is an NLP powered web app that provides customized recommendations of campgrounds and summaries of reviews. Given one of your favorite campgrounds and optional search criteria, the system will recommend similar campgrounds according to campground features and reviews. In addition, the user will retrieve review summaries for the listed campgrounds.
