We haven’t experienced customer service like this before. When we arrived to our campsite we were a little bummed, the site didn’t have much privacy, we were in the front area where the trailers are. Andre came by right when we got there to ask us how we were, we mentioned the lack of privacy and he said no problem, he found us a place that was completely private. it was up this hill and we absolutely the loved it! Looks like they had a stage there to do shows or something. We liked the fact that we were close to people but not so close at the same time. The beach was medium sized, the water was ice cold but it was so hot that didn’t even matter. We had our boat with us and it was nice to dock it for the weekend so we didn’t have to keep it on our site. This place is great for families with children. They do enforce quiet time at 11pm which wasn’t a problem for us but if you are looking for a party camping weekend look else where. 

The showers and toilets were cleaned on the regular and looked newly renovated. the only thing that might deter someone would be the lack of hot water in the showers ( just get there super early to ensure you can shower before everyone) and possibly the size of the showers. I’m average size/height and found it somewhat difficult to wash. But I mean your camping so just take your two min shower in the morning and head out to enjoy the rest of your day. Still get 5 stars!

We would definitely come back, next time with the kiddos!",1531784518

We thought it would be something like a koa or park campground-natural, filled with families on vacation, lots of green space and trees. Really it was just a shanty town filled with people living out of their RVs. They had them crammed in as tight as possible and many of them had built decks, sheds, etc on their tiny RV site.  Most were in a somewhat dilapidated state and had junk and debris on their little ""plot"". Only one or two kids in the whole place. Definitely not the fun, festive, tourist vibe. Lake access was pretty sad. Next to a highway and was a ""gated"" community",1535397410

Carols was booked at the time. After driving 6 hours, and setting up camp in the dark with three small children, we went to purchase wood, and our store was out. I walked across the driveway to their store where the owners were sitting, and asked if I could purchase from them. I was abruptly told no, I wasn't a camper with them and they laughed at me as I tried to figure out if they were being serious. I understand not letting someone use the facilities, but barring a paying customer from something like campfire wood, at a campground is pathetic. Especially when travelling with it is prohibited, requiring campers to purchase locally. We had to pack up our kids and drive to get take out. Something so ridiculous ruined our night on our vacation.

I gave 1 star because ""0"" not an option. After 42 wonderful years in this park it has gone to the dogs after new owners took over in 2017. So much so that after we purchased a 2017 41' Quailridge mobile home (sleeping in it for a few weeks) we made the tough decision to pack it in. The new owner was a nightmare to deal with, gave everyone different information creating mass confusion, would out and out lie, has a mouth like a trucker and zero people skills. The park is in total disarray while he works on upgrades. He is very happy to have many, many long standing campers leave the park. To a few that decided to stay, he gave them 30 days to relocate their trailer, decks, sheds to another lot in the park at their expense. Needless to say those campers have decided not to stay now.

We spent 4 miserable days at this park and will never go back.  The check in staff sent us down roads that could not handle a big rig.  After getting stuck on branches and backing out onto a side road, a maintenance worker helped us down a road that only had the issue of low hanging utility lines…  He held up the lines with a long piece of lumber while we drove under them to our mud bog of a site.  The site was so sloped that I needed to use very block I carry to get even close to level.  We were in a large mud hole that was as large as our rig.  Then we find out that they don’t have sewer hookups and that their dump station is up a hill and on a corner such that big rigs cannot get to it.  We ask about options and they tell us they have a mobile dumping service... for $30… only on Tuesday and maybe on Wednesday.  We pay and wait on Tuesday morning, and wait some more, and wait some more and finally go to the office to check the plans for the mobile dump service before they finally showed up.  The bathrooms and showers were never cleaned.  I had the same grass and mud in the shower stall on every day.  The only positive for this park, other than leaving, was they had working wifi.

We looked at a #of parks before choosing this one. This one had the highest fees so we were expecting the service to match that, but unfortunately it doesn't. 
The pros:
Lots of amenities (pools, mini golf, etc.)
Close to the city
Family friendly- kids everywhere
Boat rental available 
The cons:
Major problems with loosing power. Most long weekends we pack up and go home.
Limited events and very little for adults or families (Would love to see outdoor yoga, movie nights etc).
Service from staff is average. Many questions are answered with ""I don't know"". The friendliest person here is the summer student  Jenna. 
Communication is terrible. If events are cancelled, you are not informed.  Events on the schedule are often ""a mistake"" and don't take place or are rescheduled. The ""Events"" board is not updated and facebook page is rarely used.
Fees are higher than similar parks.

As of writing this, the power has gone out AGAIN.  After we keep getting told that the park is taking the necessary steps to avoid it from happening again but there is no improvement.",1533487607

THERE WERE NO SERVICES TO USE IN THE PARK. EVERYTHING WAS SHUT DOWN.  THE PARK WAS EMPTY THE HOT WATER TAPS WERE NOT EVEN ON IN THE BATHROOM. i OFFERED TO PAY A REDUCED FEE BUT SHE REJECTED THAT. ONE REASON  WE WENT THERE IS TO SEE IF WE WOULD LIKE TO CAMP THERE.  WE OFTEN GO TO CAMPGROUNDS BEFORE HAND AND LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF WE WOULD LIKE TO VISIT THAT CAMPGROUND AND I HAVE NEVER COME ACROSS A SITUATION LIKE THIS.  i UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE VISITOR PER DAY FEE AND I AM OK WITH THAT BUT REALLY FOR 1 HOUR AND NOT THE WHOLE DAY AND NOT EVEN IN PRIME SEASON THAT IS CRAZY.

Read a few of the negative reviews and was a little concerned  - I needn't have worried.  Sheila, greeted us by name, gave us clear instructions on what was expected of us on our stay and what facilities were available.  
Nothing unreasonable at all.
The site was an easy pull through with plenty of space, a new bench table, in-ground firepit and a recycle bin on each site.. 
The hydro sites are quite close together so if you want a little more privacy maybe book one of the backcountry unserviced sites towards the beach.... which is lovely, shallow enough to make it a great place for kids to swim and play and deep enough for adults further out. 
And speaking of kids. They have a playground, tennis, basketball and volleyball areas as well as a sand pit for the kids close to the campsites. 

The washrooms are basic, campground fare, concrete floors and cold water only on the sinks. When I mentioned to Sheila on our first morning that the hot water had run out by the time I was ready to shower, she immediately sent someone to turn on the second water heater. Never a shortage again! 

Jim pointed us in the direction of a couple of places in the area not to be missed. Burks falls and Screaming Heads. Well worth the visit.

River on one side and a lake, for swimming and kayaking, canoeing, fishing. 
And they are expanding to include more serviced sites next year.
Would definitely recommend to anyone who appreciates a little of the comfort of home in a tranquil treed setting. 

Many of the campers had dogs, which were generally well behaved and quiet. They even include a section of the beach just for dogs.",1535991538

There are angled sites for trailers/RVs as well as small sites for tents.  The front desk staff are friendly and the store has many items you'd need for camping, they also sell wood and ice.  There's a barn where events happen with laundry and an arcade on the lower level. You can also rent little peddle 4 wheel karts to tour around the area.

It's a beautiful campground clean maintained showers and bathrooms not to far from the campsite. Price for a weekend for a site with water and hydro is $48 + HST a night. This is about average for camping in the area. The swimming pool was clean and large with two shallow ends to keep from having a over crowding of kids. The pool was a bit of a walk from the camping area but nothing too far out. Lot's of family friendly activities. The petting zoo was small with three goats and a pig. Nothing to spectacular. Fire wood was a little on the pricey side at $10 a bag. We found the campground to be clean and maintained. Sites are very close together not much for privacy. The Park equipment for the kids is a little outdated but the kids didn't seem to mind. Lot's of large mouth bass in the lake for fishing.  Make sure if you are tenting it out to check the site for lots of grass. Although the sites near the water/hydro RV side have mature tree's and nice lots. There is a lot of mud when it rains because a lack of grass due to the trees blocking a lot of the sun out. They do lock the gates between 9pm-9am but they do offer a access card for those who need to get in after hours. Overall very happy with the experience.,1535519475

I cannot comment on whatever conversation took place between you and the owner. However, I can comment on our opinion of you as a neighbour. You had 3 children and 2 large dogs with you in a small travel trailer, my guess is it was under 25 feet in length. I never saw your children out but I heard them, you and your dogs constantly. Your doors were being slammed every few minutes. So much so that several of your neighbours complained to the owner about the noise. I was unable to relax and watch TV in the evening because of this banging. How you have a usable trailer left bewilders me as it took such abuse from you the occupants. As regards refunds again I cannot comment other than to say we paid over a thousand dollars for the month. As a monthly rate is generally discounted and it is common practice for a company to charge more for weekly rates, rebates should therefore reflect this pricing. We are full time RV""ers and will head south to warmer climates in a few days, thankfully for us we have been able to relax in our home since you and your noise left. Green acres is a beautiful camp ground with excellent clean facilities, superior to many others in the area and it deserves credit not condemnation for trying to maintain this standard.

There was two empty lots around us but we were told the kids were not allowed to run through them. Then another guest told us the owners were spying on us and admittedly told other campers that that’s what they were doing to get evidence of the kids talking loudly. Then they would circle our site with their golf cart giving us accusative stares. I have never been to a place that made us feel like we didn’t belong or didn’t know how to care for our own kids. This wasn’t just the owners fault, it’s also the type of campers that camp here. I have no idea why or how some people don’t enjoy watching kids laugh and play?

Although I have read mixed reviews concerning the management of the campground (including that the adverse side of the park managers appear to lean more towards micro-managing according to some of the above reviews), I will say that the website can be misleading to prospective campers who have RV’s. I approached the park manager last summer and said that my wife and I are interested in purchasing a seasonal site for the next year. The lady ask me how old my RV was and upon learning that my unit was just over 10 years  old (it was 11 years old at the time) she refused to accept my application, clearly stating that RV’s older than 10 years are not accepted in the park. 

Although the policy is in my opinion somewhat discriminatory I probably cannot argue that the management can exercise that particular right to refuse units based on age. However, that they do not mentioned this restriction on their website when they advertise and promote all their so called wonderful attributes of their campground can mislead customers wanting to purchase stayovers.

UNFORTUNATELY the owner has an awful passive aggressive attitude problem. As long as you don't need to ask her anything you should be good! I was VERY upset that Christy thaught it appropriate to ""punish"" my 12 year old for bringing a small puppy into the rest area without first speaking to her parents or nicely reminding the CHILD that animals weren't allowed in the restrooms. She handed our daughter spray cleaner and told her to clean it, without ever checking the bathroom before or after the punishment was enforeced. To top it off when we went to use the restrooms that night they were trashed garbage overflowing, toilets not flushed... I mean if your that concerned over a 3lb puppy in the bathroom maybe the staff should show a little more attention to it. We also had a friend call to ask for directions and see if there was swimming and a fee for coming to visit... She was told a dollar to visit be out by 11 and hung up on... Ridiculous!

I went to office just to let them know to send someone to check those washrooms and the guy just looked at me and smirked and said ""next time try the ones beside the beach"".

Ed and Julie are really welcoming and make it a priority your stay is superb! If you want a perfect ice cream scoop make sure you find Ed at the store - which also has almost everything you need if you happened to forget some groceries, snacks or even small camping gear. 
It’s pet and family friendly with lots of activities to enjoy or just do nothing and unwind.

Have been visiting with friends for camping, swimming and boating for about 4 years now. Sometimes we bring bikes which helps because the beach is a bit of a walk. Sometimes we just drive the car down. The lake is great for boating and waterskiing. We have rented canoes here in the past as well. The only annoyance is that you need to bring quarters to use the showers. I can do it with one quarter but my daughters need 2 to rinse their long hair. Also a nice pizza place on the lake and a marina with a small store which is really convenient. Short drive to Parry Sound and Canadian Tire.",1536716145

We booked a site with them for two nights as we had a wedding in the area.

Our stay was on the tailend of a week of camping in a pop up tent trailer and we were tired. We had a three year old and a nine month old in tow.

There were no issues getting our site and organized. 

It’s evident that it’s a community with people that stay the entire season with them year over year. Everyone is friendly.

We didn’t have any firewood and got such a cold snap the two nights we were there. The first night people told us where their own wood was and to help ourselves. The second night residents came buy each sharing some of their wood and leaving it by our fire.

I can’t say enough nice things about this place and would gladly visit again.

He then yelled at me, saying he talked to me first. I replied that no he hadn’t, again we’d just gotten there. He kept yelling, but finally stormed off to the gate to let us through. He shook his head at us angrily as we drove through. I’ve never been treated so poorly by an employee. Our young children were in the backseat and had to witness us being yelled at and it scared them. We weren’t even camping, just dropping our daughter off for a night camping with grandma. I would give zero stars if I could. I will never, ever in a million years go back here or even recommend this place. They should be ashamed at how they treat people.",1532834081

But, I felt that this was a park which catered to seasonal residents and that those of us ""passing through"" were only tolerated. The RV sites would have been completely muddy if we had significant rain; fortunately it stayed mostly dry. 
Unfortunately, we had a problem with our water heater and had to rely on the showers provided by the park. We have travelled a fair bit over the last two years and have stayed in parks ranging basic to luxurious. The one constant was that shower areas were clean, even if a bit worn. 
Olympia has showers only at poolside, with toilets, sinks, etc. I don't recall seeing anything this depressing anywhere, anytime. Doors all open to the elements, leaves and debris blown in. Three colours of chipped, worn paint on the floor, bare concrete underneath. Plywood doors on the toilet stalls, everything looked grungy and depressing. I was so angry with myself that I'd forgotten to bring a pair of flip-flops with me. 
I have to say that I really appreciated the blue bins scattered around the site; makes it so much easier to keep to our regular recycling habits. And it was nice to see picnic tables and firepits, one of the perks of rural sites. 
Not sure what to say about staff, we shared our concern about the shower/washrooms with staff, who responded that ""our bathroom guy is kind of hit and miss"" and that our comment would be passed on. However, when we left, the owner's contact info was provided, and we were directed to share our opinions with him. 
All in all, I have to say that I would not return to this park. One visit was enough for me.",1538409055

Had issues with appliances 're:
The coffee maker never shuts off & leaks water! Big cleanup after making 1st pot. Had to put unit in sink. & full up. 2 additional cups. The stove gas holes in back burners had plugged holes which made for uneven cooking. When we were having a fire in our we could all smell the waste in our area which made it quite unpleasant to sit around fire.
I would recommend look @ appliances more closely as the coffee unit should be thrown out and replaced with new 1.  
The gas appliance should have annual maintenance & I don't know what you can do about the smell from waste pipe.
I almost forgot, the fridge freezer section fan motor has frozen so there was continuous noise throughout the entire stay.

You'd also KNOW there's ALWAYS been weeds there.    The park does not control what's beyond the edge of your lot nor are they RESPONSIBLE.  Your review of management is unfair.   Perhaps it's your attitude that makes it difficult to get along with anyone.   Management is new this year and it's sad that people like you can't handle change !   Think about this. They're only HUMAN and have dealt with ALOT of petty, ridiculous complaints coming at them from all ends.   I wish you luck finding another resort with prices that are cheaper than this park with all the amenities etc.  Parkbridge charges even more.  You pay for what you get.   If you want a cheaper campsite close to water, try KOA.    I hate when people dump on others with blame etc.  ESPECIALLY over something they're not responsible for. which are the  NATURAL WEEDS IN THE WATER.  Maybe you should contact the Ministry of Environment instead?  I doubt very much they'll take away the natural habitat of the wildlife that have been using these ""weeds"" as their homes for many years before you even existed in this world     You chose your lot, you bought the trailer on it, and now you're complaining??

BRENT & NICOLE the owners and hosts are such great people. I live 4 hours away and this was my first visit. I must have called them 20 times after my first inquiry with questions etc. They really want you to enjoy the place and have a great time! 
 They have these really nice cosy, warm, well equipped cottages 1 minute from the A trail. You can park your sled right at your door! They have a full kitchen so you can bake, fry or broil anything you bring along with a microwave, kettle, coffee maker and a decent sized bbq on the deck! Pots, pans,plates and cutlery too!  It’s literally a home away from home. All you need to do is bring your food, condiments and coffee and your dialed in for a great stay! There is also a general store and LCBO 5 minutes away! The bedrooms are a good size and the beds were comfortable and the cottage was very clean! 
 My son had a problem with his sled that most likely would have ended our trip however when I called BRENT to inquire what was available in the area for parts etc, he replied an hour north or south and even that was limited. BRENT asked me what the problem was so I told him and he said he would be right over. BRENT took the time out of his day to do some repair work on my sons sled and a short time later we were back out on the trails. 
If your looking for a great clean friendly reasonably priced place to stay while sledding some of the best groomed trails in Ontario between Matawaw and Petawawa then don’t give it a second thought; call BRENT or NICOLE at Pine Valley! I’m so glad I did and I will be back again; with more friends! 
I would like to extend my gratitude and appreciation for an amazing stay!

The good:
(Went during a fall weekend that was pretty quiet and high risk temperature wise.)
- It was fairly quiet, lines at water park were nearly non existent. Kids could play mini golf as much as they wanted with no wait, plenty of seating as well. 
-Rest rooms were clean, showers in campers area were the best I've seen in over 30 camping trips.
-Did the campsite option. Site was large and offered plenty of room for two vehicles and a camper and a tent.

The bad:
-Maybe it's because my preference is radio free camping, but use of radios was very prevelant. Possibly because of the amenities you get the folks expecting a theme park experience? Had a run in with a fellow camper rolling in at dusk and immediately cranking the music so loud I couldn't even talk over it to get their attention.

-Also in same vein, Late Night Campers. 
In any camping experience there's always the group that likes to chill by the fire till the wee hours of the morning, which is never much of an issue in radio free camping. However apply plenty of alcohol and people ""forget"" how loud they and their radios are.

As such the bad issues are only situational, and there is always some expectation of lack of privacy, nothing that would be against the park, more an awareness of what type of campers are drawn here.",1538964604

They have shuffle board, horseshoes, bingo at night, crafts during the day time, they even had an astronomer come out with massive telescopes one night set up on the beach that you could look through various lenses and see Saturn, Jupiter and the moon, so very cool. The beach is amazing and they have giant inflatable water play center with a slide, climbing things and monkey bars which reminded me of an American Ninja training center. Remember to bring your life jackets. Summer house does seem to nickle and dime you for everything and boasts an old persons mentality to sound such as having no radio request posted up in various places around the park. One day they had drummers come and play on the beach for two hours which was absolutely annoying as it was the same beat, ear wrenching and deafening. They have plenty of outdoor showers and bathroom facilities located around the park. They have an onsite diner and a decent store with plenty of almost four dollar bags of ice. They lack electric on certain sites meant for tenting and need to trim up the water front campsites that have too much growth covering the water front views. Nevertheless it was a great place with plenty to do through out the week for family and kids.

The cabin was fine, had a lot of dead bugs, but that is camping. The beds are moderately comfortable, pretty thin mattresses. 

There is a small fenced area for the dogs, but it is VERY small. I have three dogs under 50 pounds and they could barely move faster than a trot, but might be nice for smaller dogs.

1000 Islands Resort falls short of a good stay for so many reasons and it's truly disappointing.  The resort itself is clean and well laid out.  There are several good sites with decent privacy.  It's super easy to get to.  But that's about as good as it gets.

My first and BIGGEST complaint is their sneaky attempt to get campers out by checkout time.  On the HOLIDAY MONDAY they did not open the pools. They didn't turn on any of the water activities.  Nothing.  Just stopped all recreational activities.  Horrible way to end the weekend.  In contrast, the weekend prior we went to Emerald Lake where they not only had all activities going but allowed us to keep our trailer on the spot until we left in the afternoon so our dog could stay cool in the trailer.  But hey, no biggie.  It's not like it was a HOLIDAY MONDAY or anything.

My second complaint is from the catastrophe that happened re the cart rentals and the poor Indian family that resulted in 5 ambulances on the scene.  A long story short: the staff gives no instructions on how to operate their cart (sounds simply but the BRAKE is not anywhere to be found) and this poor family of 5 took off down a hill, slammed into a parked truck and the end result was horrible.  I won't get into details.  But to make it worse, only 2 staff members went to the scene, looked around, and left shortly afterwards.

On a smaller note, they had no fire wood all weekend and we were told to go into town ""it's cheaper there"".  

Poor service.  Poor staff.  Left feeling ripped off.",1534621450

Site is well shaded and no issues with water, electricity or sewage. Friendly campers.

The bad points:
1. Facilities are not what is represented on the web site. Bubble soccer field is not enclosed. Water paddle bikes are only available on weekend and water enclosure for that is also much smaller than represented on the site. Water slide enclosure the same thing.

2. There was only one blow up castle (a climbing gym) even though the web site showed many other types.

3. The pool was closed on the Monday of a long weekend and was never opened by posted times. Posted times were pretty late as well - 10 am even on weekends. They ran out of chemical testing materials and delayed the opening another 1.5 hours one day.

4. Very few staff. They don’t make any effort to make the rounds to check on things.

5. Only one garbage bin and no recycling available.

6. The playground is a tiny zip line and another slack line with rings and trapeze bar and that’s it.

Since the campground has come under new management the site seems to have deteriorated. Thankfully the section we were in had a family with kids the same age as ours to keep each other busy.",1533911858

Where do i start... First thing...  booked 2 full service sites beside each other back in April/May... 
When i booked the sites i specified which two sites i wanted & I was told  that there wouldn't be any issue with it been after season... They don't take a deposit nor do they email anything out to verify the booking..( Which I thought was weird but the store manager said everything would be fine... ) 
Well should have know things would go wrong... I phoned up to the campground on the Tuesday before the weekend & got voice mail indicating store closed until Wednesday.. I left message and no return call back from them...
Son arrived on Friday afternoon to check into his site and they didn't even have us down in there booking book...
There was someone already on one of my requested sites and when i got there to check in, the young girl in the office had no idea what was going on...so she called the store manager up and let me tell you... She is the most RUDE person I have ever came across in my camping years... She made it sound like we where lying about booking sites back in May...
We did get two spots for the weekend... But when I told her that i was going to place a  review on the web site... She rudely said if I write anything negative about the campground or my experience this weekend...that I won't be welcome back to the campground ever...
But no worries I have no intentions to ever go back there...
 So to all fellow campers "" BE AWARE AND STAY FAR AWAY FROM ANCHOR BAY CAMPGROUND""!!!
If you still wish to camp here.. Be Aware of the Crusty Old Lady... Who calls herself a campground manager... Who needs to take a customer service course on how to deal in public relations",1536542325

Staff are very inviting and extremely helpful even when they are busy during peak times of the year.

I used to camp regularly at this location while married and never looked at other locations after we found this amazing place. 

They offer amazing fishing and non motorized boating and even simple boat rentals and even a beautiful pool to use as the lake is tough to swim in due to it being very weedy. 

Latest Mix International recommends this location for camping or seasonal RV or trailer services. 

Prices are very good and below anyone else within a 76km range approximately.

Sites are close yet still big amount of space per site. Small place with few regulars.  Not a lot of golf cart traffic making it safer for our kids to walk the campground. Brand new playset! Nice addition! Pool was clean and warm! The pool bar was cute and a great hangout place for us as the kids swam. Use of equipment was free (horseshoes, basketballs...)  Pond was disgusting, maybe due to low water?  And just a heads up, Bass Lake is more the size of a river. Very narrow and shallow for most parts.
My main negative review! I Do not agree with site cost for 4 people.  Many families have more than the typical 2 kids, like me and 2 of my brothers.  Extra charges for more children is the reason we choose to camp vs a hotel.  In hotels it is a capacity based on evacuations. What limits the people when camping in open space?  
I would totally go back especially since I hear the improvements the guys want to make at the campground!  Jumping pillow and outdoor theater were a few ideas they are working towards.",1535726981

Nadia is the most caring, and splendid woman. She took care of all of our needs beyond our expectations. A true divine woman whom we loved from first meeting. When entering the cottage it was freshly cleaned, everything you could possibly need the cottage was equipped with. The grounds of the park are manicured to perfection. All in all, a little piece of Paradise we were sad to leave. We have been back a few times since and with our children who enjoyed this park just as much. Nadia is the soul of the park, if you feel like having a porch side chat with an amazing , intelligent hilarious woma, Nadia is that woman. I am looking forward to making more memories each and every chance we get
I would recommend this park in the highest regard. No nonsense, no parties, just pure family fun and relaxation. Positive mannerisms by all we met  with smiling faces. 5 stars is just not enough for the fantastic care we were given at this park. 
Cant wait to be there opening weekend and many more 
Thank you Nadia and family for your compassionate care you put into every detail and make us feel like family xo

Park is beautiful ,  the office admistration lady Jan was a professional to deal with and always pleasant.  

The parks regulars , at times can be brash and on some occasions they tend to get extremely intoxicated , causing a distruption in the parks natural tranquility.   Loud music past quite times coupled with the odd fist fight makes this park at times less desirable .

It’s a beautiful place , it is a real shame it’s a Party atmosphere there , drug use at some sites , we have seen first hand.   

Lastly the owner Amin is a nice fellow , although he is naive on the going ons at at his park.  He is mostly absent from the park , which again allows for the nafarious actions of some of the park patrons and the maintenace staff.",1534456887

The owners were very friendly and accommodating.  They offered free wifi, although it didn't reach our cottage (Jennifer is the biggest and furthest away).  The picnic area in my photo is all you had to walk over to get a decent signal on the wifi.

The only drawback is their boat ramp.  It pretty much worthless for larger boats.  Its super shallow, I had to either submerge my truck to float my boat off the trailer or push it off the trailer (the obvious choice).  This isn't an issue if you have 2 people though since the ramp down the road at Elim Lodge is public and very nice.

People have been known to drive drunk and drove right into the park shop (a minor at that) people have also rode their bikes drunk and crashed into bushes. Over the winters when most regulars arent there things get stolen and now that people are there things are still being stolen from peoples cars parked right outside their own trailers and even down on  the beach with people right there. The owners arent even making any attempts to find out who the thief is or to detur it in anyway.

Very friendly people in the park. Our biggest complaint as a weekender was that none of the sites were level! Bring lots of leveling blocks. We had 4 x 1"" boards under one set of tires and we needed 3, 4x4 blocks at the back for our stabilizer jacks to touch the ground. Even our lawn chairs were on an angle no matter which way you sat.

Park was not busy during our stay and spots seemed roomy. Location is easy for on and off hwy, just a short drive to handle.

Pool looked inviting and clean. There are a number of permanent RVs in the park, all appeared to be well kept. Some great spots with all the gardening some owners have undertaken. Hookups were handy and all services worked well.

We stayed there this Labour Day weekend, arriving Friday afternoon. After being charged $38 non refundable when I booked, I was told I had to pay for 3 nights minimum even though I only wanted 2. I agreed because now I have no where else to go. We are shown to our campsite which is the size of a postage stamp and has no business housing a 32’ trailer. We step outside of our trailer, take 4 steps and reach the edge of our site. There wasn’t even enough room to park our truck. Our fire pit was right outside our door, couldn’t put our awning out and had no room to put more than 2 chairs around it. We left for a baseball game, upon our return we were confronted false and accused of speeding. My husband and I have been to many, many campgrounds throughout the years and have always obeyed and respected the rules. We understand and respect the need for speed limits, we are parents of 2 small children and would never put others in danger. My husband tried to defend himself and was met with snide criticism. After deciding to leave early, I asked about their cancellation policy and was told there isn’t one, once we were there, that was it. I again agreed, took my loss and we left. When we arrived home, I reviewed my receipt and noticed extra charges. I was charged for additional people and couldn’t understand why, it was just my husband, myself and our two children. I phoned the next day and asked what their rates were and how many people were allowed on a campsite. I was told no more than 6 people per site. Then when I questioned my receipt, they backtracked and then told me that they only allowed 2 people and extra would be addition charges. Right after they told me 6 maximum! What campsite only allows 2 people? If I was told this when I phoned to book, would never have agreed. I was then insulted on the phone, told I was just being bitter because my baseball team lost! How dare they use that against me! Not only was it untrue and unfair, it was so disrespectful and unprofessional. We have NEVER been treated so poorly or had such a horrible camping experience.

Was checked in by a teenager, didn't seem to know the rules or able to answer questions. Had a cabin. Need to specify more throughly what you need. Only had spoons, no sharp knives or forks. No can opener. Just little things like that. We were thinking it was small for our families, 6 kids and 4 adults, but didn't really spend much time in the cabin with all the fun. During the week it's pretty quiet, but we had the beach and pool to ourselves pretty much, which was great! Kids and adults both had an amazing time. The weekend got crazy, but in a good way. Bar filled up and more kids to play with. Cabin maintenance and more informative website on cabins would be nice. Maybe an update is needed. But, if you want a place for quiet family fun during the week and a rowdy weekend, this is the place. We will definitely come back, the kids cried when we left! Thanks for a great time!",1534718989

This is regarding a post that was put up on Sunday evening. Parks have rules that goes for seasonal or overnighters. Children have to be on there lots by 10p.m. . If you are riding a bike you must wear a helmet. In your case you found that it was above you to obey these rules. Golf carts are used to make sure everyone in the camp are safe and obeying rules. Your children were asked to return to there site, which they did not, that was after 10 p.m.. After speaking with your children a couple of times, the owner then approached the parents. The Sunday evening the same thing happened. When parents were approached again , the father was rude. And very belligerent.
In case you are not aware headlights on a vehicle will go out automatically after a vehicle shuts down after a couple of seconds you just have to be patient but instead you chose the route of being belligerent and started cursing and swearing at another camper, threatening them etc. You forgot to mention when you where asked to leave ,the campground paid for your taxi also refunded you money so there would be no more problems.

All and all  I myself  enjoy camping here there is lots of activities for the children and the adults.

Richard then proceeded to avoid us & working this out with us all week end... very grown up & mature ..... upon talking to others in the park most are disappointed with the running of the park.... the website is extremely misleading ... the place is very run down & not getting better. The reason we wanted to go seasonal was because we believed in the vision, we believed Richard even when we were warned about his BS.... then we drive 3 hrs to sign our contract & get to work on our lot only to find somebody else on it & top it off with management telling story upon story back peddling & being extremely untruthful to us. Extremely disappointing to say the least. We paid for our week end as we had plans in the area all week end & had hoped Richard would man up & work this out with us. Staying really opened our eyes to issues we noticed over the week end... the couple fighting & shouting obscenities... & her squealing away .... the dog that atacked another dog was so scary.... the family who’s dog was atacked was shaken up beyond words...listening to a person shouting to cars to “slow the eff down”, the lady telling kids not to play around her car .... we wanted to be part of the new growth & give respect to ones trying as we had hoped to be along side you, but it seems to be going backwards not forwards... the family beside us was asked by Richard to check their bank account to see if they paid for their site because he didn’t know.... they were extremely shocked at how bad the place was compaired to what the website portrays... we felt really bad for them.... if you want to party & drink your but off in a run down park run by a guy who just says whatever you want to hear because he will forget you once he walks away, then this is the place for you....

We (family of 5 + another couple on a tent site), had a wonderful time.

The owners were very nice & there always seemed to be staff working, & patrolling around. They were very quick & helpful bringing us firewood & troubleshooting a power issue (note: don't use hotplates while camping - too many watts!).

We booked late in the season & got the pullthrough site next to the bathroom. Those sites were _very_ narrow, barely fitting our dining tent & no shade on those sites. But that was really my only concern. It was nice that my two oldest could get to the washroom & playground by themselves because they were so close - a new level of independence for them. 

The playground is old & a giant sand pit... not great but I was told that plans are in the works to re-do it. Awesome! If the newer showers & rec-hall are any indication, it will be top notch! I never fault a place for having issues that they are actively planning to fix: owning a campground must be so expensive & a bottomless list of renovations.

The salt-water pool was refreshing & getting a lot of use. The weather was roasting when we were there! The kids loved swimming... even the chilly man-made lake was a neat experience braved by our normally warm-water-loving family. The slides in that lake were very wobbly & made me nervous for the younger kids & grown adults... maybe a newer substantial slide with water coating would be a nice addition.

We had a few trips to the shop for icecream. Enjoyed the free, nice showers, and the new-looking laundry facilities. Wi-fi was spotty but free. Nice that I didn't feel like I was being gouged for extras. Even loads of firewood were affordable.

Sandy soil in the area & lots of sand-play areas so bring old clothes for the kids.

A well-run campground & we had a great time! Highly recommended.",1533748776

Pool shuts down for an hour (I think between 3-4 or something like that) for adult swim...that was kind of a bummer as my kids then wouldn’t go to the freezing cold splash pad after that...but all in all...it was a fun family weekend and we did pick a good campsite with some shade which helped.,1539174606

Hard to get in seasonally if you have a trailer unless you buy a brand new one exclusively through the park, which you will get a spot however you still have to pay a premium rate for it compared to other sections. Otherwise you can get a used one from a seller on the grounds but most of the ones I've seen are overpriced and going for more than the cost of a brand new one.",1537011550

Footprints is the most peaceful, romantic, beautiful, and abundant with amenities resort I have ever been to, and I recommend it to You completely!   My fiance proposed here, and he said it took him all week to do because there is honestly not a single location that isn't picture perfect for such a romantic occasion.  There is lots to do, on water and on-land, all on the resort and all included in the super fair prices for lodging.  All options for accommodations are luxurious.  We stayed in one of the newly built villas but the cabins, rooms and even campground for tents and trailers seemed so nice we promised we'll try those next time, and we are going back!  Possibly for the wedding!  
I could go on and on, we so thoroughly enjoyed our time here and our hosts were so amazing, they felt like friends the minute we got there.  They have thought of everything, jacuzzis, pool, watersports,  biking, trails, TV, showers, etc., the main understanding that everything is free to use; just be courteous and return it where you found it and clean up after yourself.  It's a resort only for adults, so that level of respect is easy to maintain, and we all want it to be just as beautiful for the next guests and our next visit, so who wouldn't!  :)
You are going to have a wonderful stay here.  
Thank you so much Matt,  Amanda and Jenn!",1532287740

The main house and pool are new buildings and the facilities were remarkably clean and very well thought out. The pool was awesome to spend a hot afternoon in and on top it was heated so there was zero shock jumping in. All the basics were available... but judging by the quality of those basics i feel this park will be a safe bet if committing your trailer here...when he chooses to expand i would expect the same quality in them aswell.

That said, it is really the only thing this park has going for it. There is a park for kids that I would say should be torn down. It is VERY unsafe. Last year there was a loose board and we asked them to fix it on numerous occasions. They never did anything about it. We finally had to fix it ourselves. The bathrooms are brutal, broken doors, and the toilets don't flush properly. Trying to get a reservation requires leaving many voicemails and crossing your fingers that they actually call you back. 
We have been going here for about 5 years because many of my family members have seasonal trailers there. The reason only reason we go is to see family. This year I had a horrible experience when one day I met the owner Michelle and her son Nathan. They were very rude to me in front of my 2 daughters. So much so that my 6 year old was crying as she thought we were in trouble. We had done nothing wrong. I think it was a case of mistaken identity, but they wouldn't even let me get 2 words in.

Nice, spacious, level pull through site, close to the pool, showers, and waterfront. The boat launch was good as well, concrete and no problem with traction. We had a boat slip near the launch and a short walk from our RV. It is a little weedy so if you have a jet drive like we do you will need to be careful, but the staff was aware of this and ensured we had a suitable spot and also spent the time to show us the best and safest ways in and out of the waterways. If you have a boat with a deep draft this may not be the ideal spot for it. One point to be aware of, we did have a sewer at our site but in reading the campground info we were led to understand that it is for grey water only, so we had to hit the dump station on the way out. Not a major issue, but would have been a bigger problem if we had more than two of us on board this trip.

to start off, we were in the off season so prices and times and site-population is all different. 
dave - the employee I interacted with, was a very kind and generous in person. offering coffee for free and helpful information on the area.
the site itself was incredibly clean, they had an employee even cleaning up apples (from the apple trees) because that was the only mess on the grounds.
the bathrooms were immaculate, unbelievably well maintained for a family run campground.
the location was in between the downtown area and the grotto entrance, which was a nice plus.
this park has; 4 wheel bikes for kids, mini put, a CLEAN swimming pool, 2 sets of bathrooms, laundry facilities, horseshoe, and a little store at the front for necessities/ gifts. 
the only negative thing I could say for me personally is that I would have preferred a more private camp site (with trees in between sites like at other places I've been to) but, not having the trees made it so we could talk to - happily - and wave at all other campers while here. so not even really an issue because of the incredibly friendly environment. 
over all, I could not have asked for a nicer place or staff or location. very happy and will be coming back next year :)",1537184932

The fire pit needs more bricks and the sewer did not have a cover, having to get up at night trying to find a bag and brick to cover the sewer was a turnoff. Lastly, it was expensive, 220 dollars was expensive  for 30 amp service for a 21 foot trailer for 3 days.

There isn't much at the park for activities. It has a very old playground, some small Washrooms (we didn't use them as we had sewers) but they looked ok. We really didn't spend much time at the campground as we went 5km down the road to the beach at Sandbanks. I didn't notice a beach at the campground but there are lots of boat docks. Not much else for kids. It is about 15 to 20 minutes from Picton or Wellington. We drove to Wellington and rode our bikes to all the wineries. The campground was cash only and doesn't take any other forms of pay. In general it was a nice level campground with very few extras. Perfect base camp to explore the area and wineries.

They rented out our site for the remainder of the season and said they were going to refund us but we’ve never seen any of that money.

We recently booked camping for two nights at the park. The park is very well kept and the grounds are quite nice. It seems we were constantly being nagged and visited by ""Derrick, the park warden"".  My estimate is that we had 6 conversations regarding parking our vehicles throughout our stay.  It rained for two straight days and Derrick was concerned about the grass indents from our vehicles.  Seems a little silly that this would be a concern at all given all the rain we had.  I would expect that each campsite have appropriate parking but the sites we had were not adequate to hold a car each without parking on their precious grass.   To have the guy drive by at least 10 times during our two day visit and always have some sort of negative comment about his grass does not make for an enjoyable weekend.
   I think Derrick should be more concerned with the well being of the campers, than disturbing them throughout the day regarding when they are leaving.
  I would also suggest that the speed bumps be altered within the entrance lane as the severity of these bumps is very hard on trailers coming in and out.  I do understand reducing the speed for the children and campers but the numbers of speed bumps and severity seem excessive to me. 

   I have read through many of the comments and the flippant responses to the comments posted, so I am most certain that this one will be recieved in the same manner with the  type of response indicating that it is not the campgrounds fault and only the camper is to blame.",1529869950

Her , chasing down your visitors to demand cash for entering the park (despite paying for a seasonal visitors pass) They will nickle and dime you to death at every curve. (visitors pass, docking fees (in and out), wifi that seemed to get turned off)  The swimming pool was seldom open and theres virtually no activities  in the park. The highlight? Watch your hydro bills and get reciepts. (They tend to not like to give them) The energy board would love to hear about their gouging! $400 for 7 weekends, (Sat and Sun) no fridge, no air. My bill was low..some ran close to a grand and more. It could be a decent place and they could have earned 3 stars if it weren't for the ridiculous pair that run the place!

I found it noisy during the day and in the evening a real pain....it took the peace of camping away. Small bag of wood for price...go to the superstore instead. More pricy then other places i have camped. Beach close only 5 minutes walk but very small beach area.  The main beach was a 15minute drive. You need to be at the main beach by 10am to get a decent spot. I would not go back to this camping site. I would find something further from the main road.,1531751164

When we sold our Park Model, Layzee Acres sells for you, taking a huge percentage. They owe us money from a forgotten bill (actually a quote; they couldn't produce a bill) and refuse to acknowledge our email requests to reimburse us.

The private outdoor shower offered a neat experience of being able to shower under the stars. The tent came equipped with a mini fridge as well as a fan so it wasn't too hot, at night when it cools down the bed featured heated blankets. It also featured a winery across the road (5 min walk) that offered incredible wine.

Zip lining was amazing and Paige and Scott were great! The wilderness suite was super cool and the beds were the comfiest beds ever. Burning kiln for dinner was so delicious and would highly recommend considering it is a food truck. Still quite fancy. A few downfalls was our observatory tour was cancelled due to cloud cover at 3 in the after noon which I though was odd. On our certificate we received as our gift it stated we would have $50 towards zip lining photos or other tours and was told that the $50 was already applied to the price with who booked our getaway. The wording on our certificate was totally misleading and a little disappointing that no one would honour this. The breakfast could use some work but overall was a good experience.,1535228396

You can walk halfway across the lake before it even touches your chin and theres no seaweed or leeches! Actually, theres almost no pests here! The only problem we had was tons of daddy long legs, but they don't bite or anything so just bring a broom to get them off your tent before you roll it. We camped on a wilderness site and had nobody next to us for three days!!

That said, it's outrageously expensive, and there is minimal parking. If you're paying for each individual use, expect to lose a twenty. The fee is $18 and change, if I recall correctly, but you're expected to leave it in an envelope in a mailbox, so it's not like you're going to get change. That's a coffee you'll never drink, dear Reader. Spread that out over the course of a summer's fishing and you'll be spending as much to launch your boat as you do putting gas in it.

The adjacent Golf Course and beautiful beaches and restaurants are an added attraction. Spectacular sunsets both in summer and winter attract both visitors and the local residents especially when the yachts sail in with their myriad coloured sails and the large Lakers sail into the port.

The day we were leaving, my wife went to speak with  him and there was some misunderstanding about how long we were staying. We did try and stay there, but due to the heat and lack of shady sites (we were in full sun), we decided that we needed to find a different site/campground. Upon hearing that we were leaving, he got angry and told my wife to ""pack up all her $h!t, leave and never come back."" Easiest thing to accommodate.

He enjoys playing billiards, and while he was there, he was approached by some resident(s) who made some horrific claims that he should not talk to the children and to tell them to go away if they approach him.  He judged the way my brother looked, making some inexcusable claims.  Even worst, on day 2, they approached him again in an aggressive manner, making him feel completely unwelcome.  After that, he returned to his cabin site and stayed there the duration of the weekend, fearful to go any where public or even join the large group we were visiting.  And the large group of families we visited with have 6 children amongst them, and all parents vouch they trust my brother with their children and kindly refer to him as ""Uncle Jay"".  He did NOTHING wrong.  At least he had a chance to explain his side of the story to one of the owners/managers, but I fear this will do nothing, as the resident will get the last word.  My brother, myself, my husband and my father in law WILL NOT RETURN EVER AGAIN.  What a shame.  I was in tears over this unfair judgement and unclaimed accusations of the most gentle soul I know, not to mention my best friend.  Just horrible.",1536092434

What we found totally unacceptable was the lack of maintenance - basic cleaning of the washrooms and showers. When it got unbearably, Campers had to take it on themselves to wash and sanitize the washrooms and showers before using them. There seem to be no schedule of time for the cleaning of the washrooms and showers.  For the 4 days we were there none of the washrooms seem to have been swept or mopped!  In the washroom behind the store, there were pieces of celery under the sink for the entire time and this one was the cleanest DIRTY one.

Now, about the lady who runs the place - Overworked, yes,  but that should not be an excuse for absolutely poor customer service.  That skill set was seriously lacking!

Arrive 20-30 minutes before the ferry to guarantee your spot. Campsite was spacious, clean, and came with a fire pit and picnic table. A good serving of Fire wood was delivered to us for 15 dollars and lasted us 1 entire day and all night. The views of the lake during sunset and the full moon were spectacular. Due to the time of year we were the only people camping so the campground was quiet and no one bothered us. The heated washrooms had a shower, sink and toilets all in good condition. The restaurant/store across the road was a good thing to have in case anyone got cold or needed a break from the outdoors. Both staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The nearby walking trails were also fantastic for hiking or snowshoeing.We were very happy with our stay here and we will be back again in the winter and summer.

There is also a playground and tons of room to bike around as well. The pool isn’t open, but the owners are planning on renovating it to have open for next year. There are plenty of other things for the kids to do, not having the pool is never a concern for us. The owners / managers take great pride in this campground - they’re always cutting the grass, the flowerbeds are done up nicely and they’re renovating the washrooms.

Horseshoe pits are near the pool too as well as a small playground with swings.

This is a great place to spend a weekend, a week or the summer. The lake has good fishing so rent a boat and go fishing. When you are done take the kids tubing or water skiing. Or just relax on the lake and go for a swim. The location is remote enough that wildlife will pass through but close enough to Westport or Kingston for any needs. For those that don't have a trailer there are well maintained cottages that are available for rent which have kitchens bathrooms and bedrooms with a barbq and fire pit. On a rainy day there is a games room.  But most important the people here are friendly and happy so you will certainly be in good company.",1513140162

********Hi Tony, I saw your review from my post. And yes I did say it was peaceful but did make a point to you via phone call that the price was way too high.

Because it was off season the trip took place at their sister company Wilderness tours. The rafting itself was nice, but we had to make a complaint about the trip, because of the group composition. The trip was combined with a school trip consisting of about 25 teenagers. Our raft was shared with 2 other guests (adults) and 6 teenagers. We did not know this in advance. At the start we assumed the teenagers will go on their own being a school group. 

Just before entering the raft we found out we had to share our raft with the kids. During the trip they were very loud and generally screaming to each other and the kids on the other boats (as can be expected from a group of teenagers). And it was a long 6 hours. We felt like being part of the school trip, which we basicly were, as the adults were the ones paddling the boat forward. At the instruction of the guide the adults took to paddling along the front and middle of the boat to be able to paddle in sync as the kids could/would not (they're kids can't blame them). They are so loud, imaging a half hour screaming contest about who OMG hooked up with who in a show called the vampire diaries.

This ruined the experience for us, because we could not enjoy being in the raft, the rapids and the beautiful surroundings as much as we anticipated. And was definitely not what we signed up for. 

We would have preferred to know at least in advance that we had to share the raft, or better being in a seperate raft. Us two and the two other adults in the group would rather have been in the smaller 6p raft instead of in the raft with the teenagers. They should have propose this option to us in advance. It is the most expensive activity of our holiday and afterwards we were disappointed as it was not the experience we expected.

We told this after the rafting trip to our tour guide. He gave us the advice to sent an email. Which we did, multiple times. We didn’t get any reply, not even an excuse. 

I’m very disappointed in RiverRun and Wilderness Tours. 
Don’t book a trip with them, since earning money is apparently more important as customer experience and service.",1534838543

We always come in mid-September so there are few campers, but I can only imagine what it is like at full capacity.  There is a fair mix of shaded and sun sites.  Most sites seem to be pretty spacious.  The cabins are very nice and offer four bunk beds, a pullout futon/couch, kitchen table and a bathroom.  There is no hot water though.  There are bathrooms spread all over the park and are cleaned on a regular basis.  Staff has always been friendly and accommodating.  There are two separate playgrounds to keep the young kids busy, and they also have a basketball court, horseshoe pits and volleyball courts for the adults.  There are also a couple small river beach area where our kids and dogs enjoy running around.  The camp store was newly renovated a year ago and carries most food items, beer, games and a small assortment of trailer gear.  And if you care about wi-fi, I do believe that they are in the process of expanding it throughout the park instead of only having it available at the store.  I would definitely recommend staying here, and we plan on coming back for years to come.",1537459327

If you only camp once every 5 years you need to know this is NOT a provincial park. It is a private facility so read the rules and regs. ALL staff are FRIENDLY AND POLITE. Washrooms are clean and well stocked and cleaned DAILY! If you know how to behave you can keep your  fire going after 12 or 1 but that's only if you have common sense and respect your neighbors. The park has a great mix of overnight sites & seasonal and the seasonal people are friendly and welcoming. The grounds are very well kept. The sites are flat and in pristine condition.

There is a large playground for kids and large grass area for lots of games. Generally, campers are quiet and keep to an 11pm noise curfew. The bathroom facilities are basic. They have fairly clean toilets, but the showers are pay-as-you-go and the water smells metalic. The outhouses are smelly, as expected, but some of the rolls of toilet paper were soaked with brown liquid (disgusting). The site cost is $39 + tax per site (for 2 adults and kids), and then an additional $12 per other adult, which makes it a bit more expensive than provincial parks if you have more than 2 adults. They also charge $3 per dog, which I find very weird and unjustified. Also, you cannot request certain sites. We requested more private sites that were further away from others, but were told that those sites were not available unless everything else was sold out. As a result, we found ourselves very close to other campers. If these issues were addressed accordingly, I would happily return, otherwise this was my first and only stay here.",1535998271

The main girl I dealt with Anika ( hope that’s it )was amazing so kind works hard constantly seen her working in office , watering plants, cleaning the bathrooms I swear the girl never stopped this weekend ! Talked to them before we came about family visiting and they allowed us to have extra people which was amazing ! People complain about all the prices —- yes they charge extra for extra cars tents people but it’s on their site they don’t hide that fact ! So your choice you don’t like it don’t book we knew booking this we had extras to pay for which was no surprise and we accepted that ! They have small little onsite store but right across the street is a much bigger store that sells everything ! Clean cute campground we had no problems at all ! Sauble falls is close walk right across the street was so awesome definately recommend going there ! We went  every night such a beautiful fun place ! Our neighbours on both sides of us were fantastic ! Sauble Beach is close drive like 5 mins away ! Sunday they did fire truck ride for the kids and the kids loved it even gave all kids a little treat bag nice little park as well for the kids ! Horseshoe pits as well !

The clientele seemed to be competing with each otheron who could be the loudest and most self-important person in the room.

On the river, this campground has currently two levels of camping spots.  Seasonal campers take up most of the waterfront but there is a lovely beach for access.

The entrance / exit are slightly hidden and a little harrowing but the view is lovely. Be in 4X4 to prevent slipping and go slowly.

The spots are wide enough to not feel like people are on top of you. The gravel pads are very flat and easy to back into as they are set on an angle. All the electric plugs are 50 amp or regular 120V but they have adapters to 30amp.

The deep well water tasted good and had great pressure.  The black and grey water were easy to connect to empty.

There are tall trees and lots of rocks. The beach is Sandy but there are lots of shells.

We say plenty of wildlife like frogs, snakes, grasshoppers, dragonflies, fish, birds. Bring your buckets to catch some.

The owner and the hosts are very kind. They are working hard at making the campground even more family oriented for a quiet weekend away from the city noise and hectic lives.

There are two very little grocery stores within 5 km where you'll find friendly staff to help you create an unplanned supper.

The bottom-line is that the owners/people who run the campground are simply dishonest/greedy/untruefull  to say anything other than avoid this campground at all cost if you are looking for a spot to camp for the night.  The scenario is a booked a 30amp spot sometime in early July for one night, August 17 as our last stop of our return journey from out west. On Aug 8 the campground called to ask us to con firm if we are still coming on the 17th.  At the time I thought it was odd but I figured it might have to do with the forest fires in Northern Ontario so I called and confirmed we are still planning to come. On the morning of Aug 17 they called again to ask us to confirm if we are still coming which I called back and stated that we are planning to be there around 7 or 8 pm that night. Once again thinking why do they keep calling? I will mention that on this trip alone we stayed at 8 other campgrounds and they never called once to confirm if we were coming. So when we arrived the following occurred

1. We were not giving our 30 amp spot as it was “double booked” there words not mine

2. Was not given any camp map, no indications if there where public washrooms showers etc. not even given a spot number. Just took my $50

3. Was challenged on why I needed a 30amp spot  anyway because “It is going to be 6 degrees out so you don’t need your “AC” – Once again there words not ours

4. We were giving a spot that was not a spot. It was wedged in between 2 spots. See pictures

5. Was asked “Are you tanks full” meaning water tanks and I said “ At a certain point what I’m paying for?”  Was told I was paying for Hydro and water like the rest of the people.

6. I had to insist that I get the water hose so the other person on the spot lost there’s for the night

7. As soon as we back in the owner/person ran off to join the annual shindig

8. Had to hijack someone to tell me where the dump station was so we knew where to go when we left in the morning.  

So the only conclusion I had was they gave my booking away to someone because I was only going to be there for one day and instead of being honest which was please don’t come they took my $50 and screwed over 3 people for the night as the pictures indicate. They had every opportunity to tell me that due to their annual shindig we would prefer you not to come. They called me 2 times.  Dishonest/greedy/untruefull  

Overall  avoid like the plague",1535151370

We love it!  Great Christian camp.  Lots of activities.  They have a pool and a pond where people swim.  The pool has hours for adults-only swimming as well.  There's also Sunday morning church services.  It's safe for kids to play around the camp with other kids.  You won't be in the park long and you will have made new friends.  No nasty stuff like booze or loud music allowed.  You need a letter from your Pastor to confirm you belong to a Christian church.  I highly recommend it.  My experience (as I've heard others say as well) is that you can feel God's peace around you when you go through the gate.  It's not just for permanent seasonal campers.  They also have spaces for weekend campers. There's a fire pit in each lot, along with electricity hook-ups, public showers & bathrooms, and Wi-Fi near the office where there's also canteen that's open now & then to get snacks.",1529511957

This was the original landing point of United Empire Loyalists in Lennox and Addington County. As such, there is a small museum dedicated to the preservation of this history, and there is a small graveyard to explore. This park offers camping with or without electrical hook-up. They do have the option to park your camper for the season for a fee. There is a sand beach with a rope boundary, but there are no lifeguards on duty. The grounds have lots of mature trees for shade, and there always seems to be a slight breeze off of the lake to keep cool. There is a play structure with swings for kids, but it could use some updating. To keep with the UEL heritage theme, there are boats scattered throughout park that would have resembled ones of the time. The cost to enter the park is $5.00/car unless there is something going on at campground like a concert or a historical reenactment.

Overall, this is a quiet park that is more than worth the entrance fee. I can easily waste my entire day in this park. It is also about 20-25 minutes to both Picton (via the Glenora Ferry) and Napanee. It would take closer to an hour to get to Kingston.",1531660245

The campsites are super close together and you have no privacy. My family wasn't given a specific site number when we booked months in advance and had asked for a shaded site with privacy. When reaching the campground we were shoved into a small lot with the seasonal camping.

""Take part in a wide range of activities available for your enjoyment!""
Their website offers planned activities, boat & canoe rentals, mini golf, horseshoes and others.
While visiting this campground, there was no planned events during the week and there was hardly any advertising for a planned event on a weekend morning. 

Their boat and equipment rentals are absolutely ridiculous! I am not putting down a $500 damaged deposit on top of a $100 6-hour rental fee to ride on an already damaged pontoon boat with no shade cover and moss growing in the bottom of it. My family and I also were informed by seasonal campers that they had witnessed this boat breaking down before it was able to make it to the heart of the lake. The dock conditions are absolutely horrible, not safe to have small children or anyone for that matter walking on the offshoots of the main dock. Soft boards and terrible stability. 

The mini golf course is another feature that is not safe to use. I am not willing to pay to play on this small course with the risk of falling through the floor and breaking my ankle. Also, while visiting I did not see a horseshoe pit anywhere and their basketball course was over sand and grass.

It is also offered that there is a snack bar down on the beach, but not once did I see it open during the whole week we stayed there.

Also while staying there, you have to pay a $2 garbage fee for every bag that you fill. I find this to be ridiculous, I have never visited a park where you have to pay to use the garbage system. Also when leaving the park, we were chased down by an owner to make sure that we had put tags on the garbage before disposing of it. I mean, really? That wasn't necessary at all. If they're so worried about their garbage system maybe they should set up more garbage cans around the park, other than the 1 down by the beach.

These people seem to nickel and dime you every chance they get! We had family friends visiting for the night who were expecting to pay a small fee to spend the night. It is noted that an overnight visitor is to pay $8 on the signs outside and inside of the store. When our visitor showed up, she was told she would have to pay the $8 fee, but when rung up she was charged tax when there was no note of that anywhere. It is quite ridiculous that they tax overnight visitors. For Pete's sake, they give you penny candy for change since pennies aren't accepted anymore!

The prices for firewood are insane! Paying $7 for a small milk crate filled with tiny quarters of wood that aren't fully dried out is disgusting. We were smoked out with every fire we had.

It's sad to say that the park conditions did not meet up to their advertising, but the only good thing about the place is the lake it is located on. Lake Kashwakamak is absolutely huge with gorgeous scenery. The fishing was great and the beach was decent, but it's such a shame there are no other private campgrounds for overnight trailer campers on the lake.

My family and I will definitely not be visiting this park again.",1469423461
