Lake Superior Provincial Park,Michael B,5,"A great collection of provincial parks arrayed along the North shore of Lake Superior.  We can there at least once each year, and have never been disappointed.  Great place for families or couples"
Lake Superior Provincial Park,Sydney Foster,5,Gorgeous views with so much to see. Perfect for people looking to get away. Plenty of activities.
Lake Superior Provincial Park,joy carere,4,"Breath taking. Would go back in a heartbeat. The drive is long, but so worth it. If you haven't been to the this part of Ontario, you are missing out. Don't count on the water being warm. We went the second week of August and being the true Canadians that we are, it was quite (shall we say) refreshing."
Lake Superior Provincial Park,R Campbell,5,"Surprisingly beautiful park just hours north of Sault Ste. Marie. The park has a headquarters with bathroom facilities but is mostly primitive. There is some hiking, canoeing, and several from-the-car strolls. No food except up in Wawa."
Lake Superior Provincial Park,Joanne DeCook,5,We had a great spot with the lake right in front of us! There was lots to do and see! Showers and bathrooms and laundry facilities. Power hook up was a bit far but we had plenty of cord. The sound of the waves was incredible! A thunder ...

Lake Superior Provincial Park,Chris Meunier,5,"I visited the park a few years ago. This park is awesome! Everything is bigger in this region. We had a great time from camping at Gargantua Bay to hiking the Sand River and even bushwhacking to a campsite that was not used in years.
