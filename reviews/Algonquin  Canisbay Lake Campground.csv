Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Eric McStravick,5,"We really enjoyed.  Lots of space on sites, not bare like some of the other Algonquin grounds.  We saw lots of wild life, moose near bathrooms, bear on trail, snakes, etc.  Construction was a little bit of a drag but perspective is ..."
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Cary and Kim McArthur,5,Great campground for families. Most campsites have decent privacy. Try camping!
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Dianne Hanson,4,Great site aside from the mud hole that could have been filled with the gravel that was piled up in the parking spot down the road.  We had a great time and would come back!
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Dan Zielnik,5,"July/August and the lake is public swimming pool warm! Amazing water and views, and the hiking trails around Algonquin park are top notch if you just want to get out for some nice views and aren't a hardcore trekker, although they would enjoy it too I'm sure!"
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Justin Fraser,5,"Staff are fantastic, site 118 was perfect, beach was well kept. Highly recommend. Beware bears visited us every night even without food around."
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Antonio Lomonaco,4,Campsites are very tiny (42) barely any room after parking two cars. Staff was helpful in telling us where not to go due to bears. Love being in Algonquin though.
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Joyce Thomson,5,"The folks on the office were wonderful when we needed to switch our site from one we had already booked to a non-reservable one... I was 4th in line at the office before 8:30 on Jul 21st & between the 4 couples who wanted a site, one of ..."
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Kevin Fitzpatrick,5,Beautiful campground for car camping in the middle of the Hwy 60 corridor  central for most of the trails that are accessible on the highway.
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,John Henry,4,"One of favorite campgrounds in Algonquin park. I do have to say it's becoming a bit run down in the restroom and shower facilities. Otherwise it's well maintained. Also the office sells ice and wood but a few other options would be nice, such as fire starters, insect spray and maybe sunscreen incase you forgot it at home."
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Shannon Blakely,5,Our absolutely favourite campground in Algonquin! Have been camping here for 28 years ☺️
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Luke St. James,5,"We have been coming here for 10 years. Great sites, lovely beach and good facilities. Some of the best bike trails in the park are just next door at Minnesing Trail. The kids still call it Cursing Trail."

Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,M G,5,Thank you Tyler and the other Cannis Bay staff for your help and assistance. This weekend I had a medical emergency camping. I cut myself badly and needed medical attention. The Park Warden Tyler was there to help within minutes of the ...
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Nick Lovalente,1,"This is definitely the worst place I have ever camped. If you're the type of people looking to have any sort of a good time at your campsite, camp private. This place feels like you have to tip toe around constantly. On top of that they ..."
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Linda Somerville,5,Beautiful lake to canoe and camp.
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Shariq Khan,5,"Lake is beautiful and perfect for swimming and canoeing but there is no campsite facing lake. Do not leave your food items or even recycles outside as this park has some bears. Before planning your visit, buy a bear repellent spray ..."
Algonquin  Canisbay Lake Campground,Jackie Manella,4,"You can get wood, and info, or borrow fishing gear!"
