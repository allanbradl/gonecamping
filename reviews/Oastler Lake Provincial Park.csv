Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Sabrina Pembleton,5,"This place is truly amazing. 
Went camping with friends and we all had a blast. The camp Ground was very nice and very clean. The views are amazing and the beach is awesome. Great for kids for swimming you can walk out and not deep. The ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Amaris,3,Pretty spot but so loud. You can hear the 400 in the distance but the road near the park is closer and louder. But that's nothing compared to the train. Still worth a visit if you want to camp close to Parry Sound. There isn't much to do at the park though unless you brought or rent a boat.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,TheLostIndieCity RadioShow,4,The is a great park. Love the walk in sites for a little more privacy and you get your own shoreline. The only complaint which the park has no control over is the trains nearby at night wake you up at night which was never a problem a long time ago until they rerouted the highway.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Liz Kamerman,5,Had a beautiful site on the lake. Lots of people complain about the trains. But honestly didn't bother me all that much. Nice small park with a decent. Beach. Will for sure be going back.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,martin lister,4,A small but charming park. The gateway to the Massasuaga provincial park. Which is more than charming.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Nick Arduini,5,Went camping here in July as part of a road trip and we were very impressed with how clean and scenic this campground was. It’s located on Oastler Lake and offers a variety of unique campsites. We would definitely camp here again.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Ryan Taylor,3,"We thought Oastler Lake was nice for  families and pet owners. Campsites were very clean and the park rangers were very helpful. We did not find it as scenic as many other Ontario Parks, but it was still nice for swimming and doing some ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Justin Diep,3,"Surprisingly peaceful and nice for a provincial park so close to the city. The park has a nice clean, although small beach and has a variety of watercraft for you to rent. The campsites themselves are bit to close for comfort and small ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Charlotte Tribble,5,"Beautiful place to spend some time outdoors, beautiful beach and everything is fairly close by to the camping areas.  Just be aware of the train that passes occasionally - bring ear plugs for the night if you're a light sleeper!"
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Stephanie Perkins,5,Great park ! A smaller park which is nice because it’s not too busy and easy to get around. The beach is perfect for a day of swimming / kayaking. The staff was very friendly. There is a train that goes by frequently making noise but it is not difficult to deal with. Will be going back had an excellent time.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Rachael Whiting,3,"All the campsites are nice, flat and clean and almost all on the water. The main bathroom and bathrooms in general could definitely use an upgrade. The beach is beautifull but a bit reedy. Good location close to town if you need to escape :P"
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Doug Davidson,4,"Beautiful campsite, clean washrooms and even a shower with hot water not too far away. If you enjoy fishing, there aren’t many fish biting here. Great campsite for swimming. The trains are frequent and loud but we knew that before we came here, and it wasn’t really a problem the second night once you get used to it."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Larry Selway,4,"Great park,nice large sites. The trains are not as bad as others have said, they are noisy but never heard them at nigft. The staff were friendly and courteous. Would definitely go back again."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,John Maier,3,Stayed one night.  The site was private.  The beach was ok.  There was a train that often goes by.   It is an average Ontario park.   Worth a stay but I would not want to stay a week.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Hayley Smith,5,"This was a really nice small park! Even for early June the water was warm enough to go swimming. We were able to rent kayaks and our campsite was right on the lake. We heard alot of bad reviews about the train, even though it did come ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Ashley VanKoughnett,5,"Oastler is a nice little park. I stayed at site #3, two sites down from the beach. The office with washrooms is just around the corner about a five minute walk. 

There is not much by the way of trails but we look a nice walk around the ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Kent Ackland,5,Nice park. It is cool listening to the trains going by.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Cheryl Whitehead,5,Fantastic park. Waterfront easy access. Canoes kayaks a paddle boards for rent. Staff awesome
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Artur K. JAKUBOWSKI,1,"I strongly do not recommend staying at this park. The park is located next to a main CN Rail line, which I wouldn't have an issue with, if it wasn't for trains passing every 45 min to 1 hour and blaring their horn late into the night. ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Reza Simatupang,4,Beautiful place to camp if you don't mind the train noise every now and then.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Sanaz Baradaran,3,"It's a very small park, good for those with yonge children. However, there's a train track close by which makes it near impossible to sleep well at night. Also, because of the way the park is situated, you don't get to experience nature... rather you great cars driving by."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Garry Simmons,3,Visiting midland went for lunch. Poutine was good large portions. Halibut was cooked just right.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Drew K,3,"Beautiful lake, not so good camping. Campsites have 0 privacy and the train comes by with its horn seemed like every couple hours (even during night)."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,michael lukiew,5,Great park for kayaking. Train noise didn't bother us at all other than making johnny Cash songs like Folsom prison reverberate through our minds!
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Cara R-N,4,Beautiful spot. Minutes from Parry Sound. Can't say I had a good park people experience - registration was great but rangers were brutal
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Alicia Wilson,5,Loved our weekend camping trip here.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Britney Jones,5,"So much fun, i like that there were washrooms and showers nearby."

Oastler Lake Provincial Park,S S,2,"The hot water for the shower was not stable at all. I only had five minutes hot water and the rest was all cold. Same for other travellers here and some of them had to chose not to take showe that night. People were playing loud music, ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Jon D,4,Park police try to act like real police. Other than that. Good time.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Chatravi K,5,Nice beach park with nice views of Georgian bay. Staff could do a better job at explaining things because we wanted to go to Massauga pp(extension of oastler pp) and there are 2 directions to go there: one for boating (15 mins away from ...
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Yan Wang,5,Beautiful park with a pet swimming area. Our lab was super happy to play in the water here!

Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Daniel Hefford,4,This is a great little provincial park on Oastler Lake. They have a really nice beach! They also have information on Massasauga Provincial Park.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Dhiraj D'Souza,5,"This is an amazing park that we visit every summer. Train tracks near the park mean loud train noises throughout the day. We were fine with it, but others may not like it. Short drive to Tim Hortons, McDonalds, Walmart, Dollarama, Canadian Tire etc."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Paul H,1,"Yes its a nice beautiful provincial park, and yes the trains and traffic are noisy, but the worst was the one car per campsite policy which is strickly enforced. We had to have 2 cars but they hassle us and give us a ticket. Such ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,P Diddyq dlytheO'Malley,4,Good family camp ground. Plus it's close to town. Train tracks are a bit annoying but easily ignored.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Steve Cleland,4,Camping spots on lakes with no power boats are better. Lots of snakes!
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Syed Ahmed,5,"Cool place to camp, swimming and camping us awesome."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Sam J,5,Great park . The sites are great size. The staff is friendly. The people are amazing. Kris of regulars here. The only thing that people may not be able to tolerate is the train as it's loud !
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Curtis Burns,5,"i live in parry sound and camp here regularly since its 15 mins away from my house, my son loves it! camp sites are nice! public beach is large enough to give space. there are boat rentals i rent canoe usually when i go, good change of ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Emma Roung,5,So beautiful! There is an active bear but it's only a small black bear. The train sound is not bad at all; if you are an extremely light sleeper I would suggest picking a campground on the point! The walk in campsites are very quiet and much more private. Washrooms are clean.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Andrew Shantz,5,Other then the trains it's a great park
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Hooman B,3,The good: campsites are close to the lake. The bad: terrible noise from the train.

Truly spectacular! The best camping I've ever experienced. This Provincial park is well cared for and maintained. Each camping spot is unique, almost all sites have views of the gorgeous lake. There are ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Jamie Spreng,1,Impossible to sleep! Trains pass throughout the night and so close the ground shakes.  Oastler drive is also busy just adding to the noise. Too bad because it is a beautiful park.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Troy Buttineau,3,Nice spot to get away for a weekend. Fairly quiet.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Jaime-Lynne P,5,"Great place to camp, though if you hate the sounds of trains - Don't go."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Shianna Hofstetter,5,"A gorgeous smaller park to explore with an abundance of hidden gems. Lots of good swimming spots, too!

Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Brent Mees,3,"Been going for years   looking old and run down, roads overgrown etc"
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Daniel DiVito,1,Trains sounding off on the hour every hour throughout the night. Tried the place twice on different years. Same result. No sleep. Also be warned. Leeches in the lake. 
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Jeremiah Latour,2,Noisy train that goes through the park and wakes you up.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Filipe DaSilva,5,"i've camped here a few times and always enjoy coming back, great little park with amazing views clean facilities and a nice little beach. 

lots of wildlife in the park including black bears, keep your campsite tidy and you wont have any issues"
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Mike Goodwin,4,"Small clean park. We booked last minute and were lucky enough to get a site. Our spot was a narrow pull-through right near the beach.
The park is more of a family weekend type of park rather than the more dispersed type of Provincial ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Christopher Heidel,4,"Nice park, we had a great campsite on the water. Other sites seemed cramped and small. Relatively quiet except for the regular freight trains passing by, which is bothersome at night. Otherwise, a nice park. "
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Cassie Sparkman,5,"We camped during the wicked storm on July 7th that shut the campground down. For as nerve-wracking and unsettling as the entire experience was, the one thing that surprised me the most was how wonderful and attentive the staff here were. ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Myka Myka,5,"Beautiful park, lake and views. By far one of my favourite of the Ontario Provincial Parks."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Lindsay Thomson,5,"We booked a camping trip this weekend at Oastler and were very excited! Based on the pictures online it looked beautiful and we had a site right on the lake (site 120). We got there Friday at about noon, and got set up right as the sun ..."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Pierre Berube,5,Oastler Lake is perhaps our favorite PP. Great lake. A variety of sites. Lots of waterfront sites. Close to civilization. Trains are a little on the close side but I don't mind them.
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Autumn Kozluk,5,"This park is an absolute MUST visit! The park is 5km from Parry Sound, ON which was incredibly convenient since we were to board the magnificent and majestic Island Queen Cruise. Staff were so hospitable with inside tips of what to do ..."

Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Ramesh Arutla,5,Amazing park with individually secluded camp sites
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Tina Gauthier,3,Clean facilities. Loud CN Freight Trains every 45 minutes all night - bring your ear plugs! Wasn't happy that I couldn't get the site right next to ours as we were separated from our family and made it difficult to keep an eye on kids ...

Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Andrey Musvitskas,4,Nice place for family weekend

Oastler Lake Provincial Park,RECKLESS G,1,Trains pass close by late at night and early morning
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,Danny Michaud,1,"This was the absolute worst place I have ever camped at.  The firewood they sold was wet, trains woke us up several times a night, and the park rangers believed their duty was to harass paying customers for nonsense.  I would not recommend this place at all."
Oastler Lake Provincial Park,jim daley,5,Always a nice getaway
