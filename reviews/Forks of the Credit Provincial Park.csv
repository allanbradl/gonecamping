Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Paul Pan,4,"Very scenic and tranquil place for hiking and biking, the trails are long enough and diverse enough for different adventures. 
And the fact that it's far from city lights makes it an easy candidate for casual star gazing (not a light ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Tyler Sarry,4,Great park that has a lot of different areas to explore and take great photos. The waterfall area at the end was a little hard to get any photos of but still a great little hike. A deer actually jumped right in front of us while we we're ...
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Roberto Dioso,5,"A great place to ride. Never I did missed going here during the riding season. Refreshing atmosphere after a long ride.

It's either grab an ice cream, a cup of coffee/beverages or just a quick stop and again hit on the road."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Sonya Riley,5,"An amazing park. We went on a 3 hour hike up to the waterfall with my 7 month old in a sling and 2 year old walking/ riding on daddy's back. It was quite the hike, but we got some amazing family pictures. Do not take a stroller or bike if you plan to go up to the falls!"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Kaija Kalev,5,It's so beautiful here! I definitely recommend hiking all the way down to the waterfalls.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Dale Clarke,5,Great little park. Easy walking and very scenic. There were toilets at the carpark as well as further into the park. Easily conquerable in half a day. Probably about 10km worth of trails all up. Beautiful fall colors and the cataract falls were very pretty.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Gordon Hannan,5,The waterfall was nice but the trail getting you closer was closed. The trail after where they disallow mountains bike is pretty steep but worth the walk. Parking was $7.50 for 4 hours. The leaves were beautiful with the fall colours !
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Ramsha Qureshi,5,Do visit this park! The drive alone is worth it. There are so many paths and trails to take. Some are more challenging than others. You can have a nice time here with family as well. Bring a picnic lunch and relax near the river. There ...
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Eda M.,5,"This is a beautiful spot with several trails for various levels of ability. If you want to get to the falls, it's a bit challenging and long. It can take an hour there and an hour back. Don't bring strollers! These trails are not ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Meg Pill,3,"They should update the signage for the falls so people realize how far it is from the parking lot. At least two different groups stopped us to ask. The falls viewing platform was under construction and closed. 

The meadow trail was beautiful though. Highly recommend it for a walk amongst the flowers and insects."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Keyvan G,4,Awesome fall day at the trails. You can cover all routes in a day. Beautiful scenery in fall with leaves colors. Good for hike bike. We spent almost four hours with kids and went through 8 kilometers of hiking.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Adrian P,4,"Great way to spend an afternoon. It took us an hour and a half to walk to the falls and then back to the lot. There are lots of hills so dress comfortably.

The falls at the end was very anticlimactic."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Nicole Fisher,4,"Scenic park with nice variety of hiking trails, though the stepped hill is a killer to climb back up! Most scenic area near the falls has been closed for a while. Would be nice to see it reopened!"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Anjana Rajeev,5,"A beautiful park just to relax, walk or hike. There isn't a lot of activities to do here. So don't bring big groups of friends in hope of entertaining them. This place is suitable for nature lovers who just want to avoid the city and enjoy nature as it is."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Noah Clauser,5,"Winding trails galore with each one having its own stunning view. Perfect for people who like to veer off the beaten path as some of the best views are just out of sight of the path. Well kept trails, plenty of maps, clearly marked paths; not much more you could ask for."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Emm Pea,4,"A beautiful trail to walk through, especially in the fall. Some trails are challenging with up and down hills. The falls are underwhelming at best. Nonetheless, the hike to the falls and back is beautiful."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Smokin Monkey,5,"Awesome spot to go hiking, cool waterfall at the end too. Definitely worth checking it out. Total distance there and back is about 5km but with the terrain expect to be going for 1.5 - 2 hours if you do the entire loop."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Martin Granger,2,"If you're going for a view of the falls, then don't bother going. It's a 45 minute walk their and back (up a very steep hill on way back) and you can't really see the falls because they've closed the viewing platform, and trees obscure ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Angela Udovic,5,WOW! The view of the falls & trails were really great. The hike was a mix of intense uphill & then a few flat areas.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Ashley Ramharock,4,Such a great place to take a nice solo or family hike.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Rick Klassen,5,"What an amazing place to visit rolling hills and trees and a river and streams,it's all there to enjoy and I took my bike there in the winter and had a blast just a few weeks ago.So much fun here and spectacular views as well as the trans Canada trail runs through it I highly recommend coming here."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Mata Bishun,5,"Beautiful spot for a 11 km hike. Leaves are beautiful at this time on Thanksgiving day. River flowing, small falls etc."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Alaina Bishop,5,"Great place to take the dogs for a hike. Trails of different length for novice to extreme hikers. Mixture of shade and sun throughout the walk if your animal doesn't like the heat. Bring lots of water, especially if you plan on walking to the falls. Oh, and have fun! :)"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Saerro Fox,5,"Amazing park, feels so good to walk in! Not many people either. My favorite experience of the summer. 

Tons of frogs on the trails so keep an eye out"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Jeremy Dang,5,Perfect place to visit especially if you are a biker!
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Jonathan Dakin,4,A nice park to hike through with relatively easy trails surrounded by fields that are decorated with wild flowers and trees.  Access to the falls is limited due to the area being sealed off so only a view partially blocked by foliage is ...
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Ryan Deen,4,Three trail entrances here. Looks like we took the most boring (mostly flatlands) route. Will definitely go back and try the others
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Donya Germain,5,"What a great place to hike. I have hiked it in the summer and winter, both were so enjoyable. I wish they would fix the walk way to the overlook of the old dam, but the rest provides a variety of trails and sites!"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Realest Titan,4,"A nice trail, good for a afternoon hike. Not so good for mountain biking due to very uneven terrain with narrow paths and lots of steep inclines not suitable for riding. Only about 40% is good for riding, the rest is better off being ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Brenda Laugalys,4,"I liked that the paid parking was flexible instead of flat rate.
Nice area, bummed that the trail to the waterfall is closed off though."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Solange Walinga,5,A nice place to go for a hike.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Chris Fuerth,2,"A lot of the waterfall view was closed off for safety.  We came because the Ontario parks leaf report was claiming close to 80% color, but most leaves were gone by then. Parking was crazy."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Henry Lukassen,3,Nice place to hike. Currently the viewing deck is closed causing alot of trouble for hiking. Its roughly $7 to park for 4 hours and hike. The scenery during fall is like no other. Water fall is currently hard to see with the viewing deck being blocked.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Sandeep Grewal,1,"We went to see fall colours, but didn't find any colours at all, infact very few trees in the park. There were more trees and colour in park near my home."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Earl Jason Collins,5,"The best time to visit is in the Fall! 
The colours are amazing!!
Don't forget to stop by the Belfountain Conservation Area ( show up early to avoid the dreaded "" parking lot full "" sign.)"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Sadaf Anam,5,"One of my favourite Provincial parks around Toronto. It is small but has very different landscapes - woods, lake, grassy fields and even a waterfall (albeit ugly)."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Dara Nafissi,4,It was great for spending an autumn day in the nature and shooting some good photos of trees with different colors.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Jai Ahir,4,Very refreshing walk. Good trails and plenty of scenic beauty to click.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Wynneth,3,The hike to the waterfall did not seem to take too long. Perhaps it was the company that I had. There are many ups and downs so don't get too comfortable with one or the other. There's also a mix between being in the sun and in the ...
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Gurv Singh,5,Awesome place... always warm and cozy...even in cold winter.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,C B,5,"It is a beautiful place to hike. Beautiful scenery and greenery. I hiked to the falls, not the easiest hike, a little challenging but worth it to see the falls. If you are an avid hiker definitely recommend this experience. For anyone ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Paul Merdock,3,A good walk.  Great hike.  Moderate to steep terrain.  Not ideal for strollers.  The only disappointing point is. The trail end just before the falls. Looks like the trail was eroded off the side of the embankment.  A fence now blocks ...
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Sanket Kothari,4,"This provincial park has multiple trails, some of which are easy enough for young kids as well. Most of the trails are not stroller accessible. Lookout for waterfall is closed for now."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Ankur Patel,5,"Been there twice for Star Grazing, pitch black just what you need for Astro Photography, plus its not far from the city. Lately its my fav spot for star grazing."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Maryna Davidovich,5,Great place for mountain biking and hiking.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,daniel barton,4,This place was awesome lots of beautiful scenery and moderate to difficult trails by foot or mountain bike
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Tiffany Richards-Johnson - Brampton Centennial SS (2502),3,"Steep trail leading to ""waterfall"". I've seen people turn back because they see what's ahead. And it's a 2+ hour hike to it so make sure you bring water and maybe a towel to wipe sweat. 

I Loved it and will be returning because of that ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Peter M,4,Great hiking here although you have to make sure to bring sunscreen. There's no shade here when you are walking. The observation deck is also out of commission so while you can still see the falls there's two hills that you have to go down and up and down and up to get back. Not for the elderly or people with leg problems
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Aj Penney,5,Such a great place to visit for a quick hike and really nice scenes to see. Great little ice cream shop to stop at once you leave the park or before if you can't wait.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Douglas Gammage,4,"Great trails and scenic.  Not overcrowded. Bring food, water and hand sanitizer.  Consider long pants for field trail in case of ticks.  Definately bring hiking boots a hat and sunscreen."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Megan Schijven,5,"Great park for hiking all year. Dogs need to be on a leash sadly and it gets busy in the summer.  The lake is gorgeous and easy to get to, while the falls are a much longer hike but worth it. Parking is paid and enforced in summer."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Vivek Damani,5,Beautiful trek to see the fall colors. The trail is not flat so wear good footwear.

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Karim Damerje,5,Beautiful trail with different habitats and biogeography. 100% would visit again
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Ana De Leon,4,A calm and relaxing place to hike. The viewing deck for the falls was under construction when we visited last Sep2018 so the long hike was a little disappointing but we still manage to get a glimpse of the falls.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,ken blackburn,5,One of the nicest hikes anyone can take close to Toronto... Love this place... been coming here for years and now I'm passing on the legacy to my son Noah so he can appretiate it too...!
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Paul Tarriwal,4,"Nice park.  Nice trails.  View of falls is blocked as trail is blocked.  Parking IS NOT FREE.. USE TO BE FREE .. that was annoying.

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Steve Maxwell,4,Awesome trail for walking and hiking
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Dilip Banerjee,4,"One of the first places I hiked in and still one of my favorites. Sadly, I remember the days when the parking was free! LOL Other than that, it has a great mixture of flat and slightly more rugged trails that meander around a beautiful ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Anthony Lombardo,5,A nice scenic hike with somewhat easy trails.  Would recommend for the family
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Dev Sud,3,"Good trails, but in summers you can't really see the falls from where the trail ends so don't visit just for the falls"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Hammad Khan,4,Beautiful hikes and lovely waterfalls ...the hikes ranged from easy to difficult with natural inclines and walkways. The hike itself was free from jagged rocks and broken branches so it made for an enjoyable hike in beautiful Caledon.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,czarina acyatan,3,"Would probably be better if we didn't go when all the trees were brown and bare. The hike up to the waterfalls unfortunately was not worth it, on the bright side our little dog enjoyed the mini lake closer to the parking lot."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Tim Hill,5,"Great park for a short hike, and good access to the Bruce trail! The grassy, rolling hills along the meadow trail are neat."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Amir Ram,5,"This is probably one of the best driving roads close to toronto, if not the best. There's a lot to do if you come during the day when the weather's nice. A couple of nice parks around and this one is no exception. Drive the forks as many times as you can, the hairpin is my favorite part 😉"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Meghana Ch,5,"Best getaway for a peaceful hike.
Not crowded and totally worth the walk."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Amir Nubheebuccus,5,Good park to hike. The drive there is pretty fun if you like to rip it on backroads

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Francesco Fasano,5,Nice place to go for a scenic view
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Melissa Rideout,4,Great hike! For those who need a more accessible hike keep  in mind towards the falls it walking can get pretty steep uphill and downhill.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Shashank Madipalli,5,Nature at its best and well maintained park
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Victoria Aleinik,4,"Loads of potholes at park entrance making it a bit challenging to drive into but once your in its a very nice park. Would recommend the trip as I had a lovely time. Many trials hiked. 

Bathrooms provided and pay parking"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Hooman B,4,Good for a day hike. The trail starts a bit flat but parts further away closer to the credit river are much nicer.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Kevin Konkle,3,It's an alright hike.  The path around the falls seems to be closed every winter which sucks.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Susan Willis,5,Amazing! Trails are well maintained and varied. Some sections quite steep. Connection to Bruce trail on the north section is closed at the moment
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Joel Phelan,5,"Great park to go hiking for an hour, two or the day. Lots of trails to choose from, huge network of trails that are well signed making it easy to find your way and these trails connect to the Trans Canada Trail and the Bruce Trail. Easy ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Krishna Katakam,5,Good for fall colours in early october
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Norm Platt,4,I like to go hiking in this park particularly from the West end where it is more interesting. The waterfalls at the north end is now inaccessible due to the instability of the area. To see some of the waterfall you have to approach the area from the lower portion. Be careful.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Vanessa V. dos Santos,2,"Beautiful place but to go to the falls there is no instruction about how far it is so it was really hard to walk all the way with my baby and my mom....
The park could put instructions saying you are that miles close to the fall..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Leeran Markizano,4,Great trail. Had lots of fun and you can take small children as well as it is not difficult  as all. I just wish people would not throw garbage there as that just ruins the area.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,David Robertson,5,Nice quiet park. Few facilities but great trails.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Zee Abdo,5,Amazing hiking experience.. Very tough but the scenery is incredible.. A must see

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,pam fraser,5,Another great day away from the city.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Allen L,4,Such a great place to go hiking with friends. Lots of trails to pick from and good for beginners to. Only a small pet peeve is some of the trails end abruptly because it reaches a privately owned land and is fenced off. But I highly recommend this location. Beautiful area and hikes can last 4-6 hours.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Minjae Chris Kim,5,It's quite a long way to cataract falls. But it's worth the hike. I would rate the trail to the falls a 6/10 in difficulty. My friend and I had some moments where we were out of breath for sure.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Shannon H,4,"Very good place to go with family, watch out for police using radar.
Beautiful drive in any season, unbelievably beautiful in the fall."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Juan Camilo Vargas,2,Nothing special. Not worth the visit
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Samantha McGowen,3,Took about an hour to get to the falls for a not so great view of them. Lovely place and great for cardio due to the hills but the view would be better if you could get closer.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Dan Motovlogs,5,"Every summer I ride my motorcycle on the Forks over 15 times because if the beautiful roads and spectacular scenery.
There are only a handful of roads I go to, and I am happy to say that this is one of the top 3 that i would reccomend to ..."

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,james moore,5,Great beautiful park. Highly recommend hiking to the falls.
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Roman Tymchyk,4,"A little hard to find. Going from the forks actually takes quite a bit to get to the entrance. There's paid parking. Nice little water area & longer trail that takes you to some interesting ruins. Out in the open though, so pretty scorching in the summer."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Goutham Narendiran,5,"Beautiful place to go hiking. Well laid out trails and possibilities to get very close to the falls.

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Jackson Corzato,5,A beautiful little town and calm nature reserve:)

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Lawrence Tin,5,"Parking was around 5.25 for 2 hours and about 7 dollars for four hours. I don't recall how much the full day was as I only did two hours. If you are planning to hike to the falls, I would suggest choosing four hours as it takes about an ..."

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Sanaz Baradaran,4,Big park with a few different trails. The fall isn't anything special but it's a good motivator for a hike!
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Sorina Dragusanu,4,Beautiful park with long trails that connect to the Bruce trail and the Trans Canada trail.  In the spring you can catch the lilacs blooming and have a picnic.

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Faisal Khan,4,"The park itself is decent, the nature there isn't very striking. Gave 4 stars to the drive on the road (i.e. Mississauga rd) which runs alongside the park - it was a really windy and fun drive!

Will I visit the park again? Probably. (since, to be fair, I haven't properly explored the place)"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Neeraj Dhakal,4,This place is nice specially in Spring and fall. I usually go there often. The drive is nice. Not enough parking spaces though!!
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Cameron Sinclair,5,"This was a fun hike today. It took me about 35 minutes to get to the falls. The trail that normally is taken to the falls is closed because the structure is unsafe, so the park has signs like the one in the photo that show how to get to ..."
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Dinesh Sikand,4,Very cool clean peaceful natural environment
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Prince Philip,4,"If you can take up a challenge, looking forward to reach the waterfalls from your car-park...its not for the weak hearted. This place has lot of steep hills n narrow path way...but surely leads to heavens paradise. Its surely a place to ..."

Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Bariah K,5,I love this place. Been up and down several times over the years. Quarrymans trail is lovely. The 14 dollar parking fee isn't really enforced. I've never seen anyone getting a ticket. Honestly I wish it was as it would deter the abusers ...

There are various features including lakes, beautiful bridges and falls. One tjis you want to be careful of is Poison Ivy. There are lots of them in the park"
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Elodie K,4,Great walking area. Just don't forget the mosquito repellent! Some trails are blocked at the moment so you might have to go back instead of making a loop. There is a parking lot for the parking fees that works with credit card (around 5$ for 2h).
Forks of the Credit Provincial Park,Yuran Liu,2,"Poorly maintained facilities. Smelly washrooms without water. All provincial parks should be taken better care of. I wish government sould spend more money on parks and children's playground. I just feel disappointed because we pay so much tax then get so little. U.S. did 5 times better job on these kind of facilities.
