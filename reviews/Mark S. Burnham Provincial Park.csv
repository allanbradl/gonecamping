Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Nusrat Jabeen,4,Went for a fall hike. It was nice but had expected better - perhaps the timing wasn't right. Enough parking spots and short pleasant hike.
Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Robin Kirchen,5,Beautiful wide trails. Great area!
Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,K Neufeld,4,Great little spot to hike. Not the biggest fan of how expensive parking is. Honestly a lot of the time I don't bother paying. $15 for a 30 min walk doesn't make sense when all the other parks and trails are free!
Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Eric Gregory,5,Beautiful park for a short walk. I really enjoyed walking through the long trail. I took my time and and struggled to make it last longer than an hour while I waited for my car to be serviced across the street. Close to highway so there a bit of road noise in the picnic area but otherwise a good spot for that.
Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Chalmers Reed,4,Beautiful place to stop and rest on the drive from Ottawa to Toronto. After a walk or a 15 min snooze ready to hit the road for the rest of the drive. Recently new washrooms but you now have to pay to park. ðŸ˜ž

Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Joerg W,5,Very good park too walk your dog clean but closed over the winter.
Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,bryan hatton,4,Great for a short hike in town.
Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Dee W,2,"Nice little park. Been going for short walks there for over ten years. The new electronic day use fee machine costs $11.25, seems a little steep for a park you can walk entirely in 45 minutes. I understand it needs money to be maintained, maybe at a reduced park fee. Won't be visiting anymore."

Mark S. Burnham Provincial Park,Kirk April,5,"My Daughter and I love this park. Great walking trails, a big Picnic area. this is mostly a walking trail park. There are 2 main trails, a short trail about 15-20 mins and a medium trail about 30-40 mins. The longer trail does have a ..."
