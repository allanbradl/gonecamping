Arrowhead Provincial Park,Heather Vanhie,5,So fun!!! I loved the rink in the forest but wish it was a little longer! Still super fun and reasonably priced as well for the day pass! Hiking trails were also a blast and we didn’t even need snow shoes! Perfect place for the little adventurers out there :)
Arrowhead Provincial Park,mark veitch,5,We arrived at a good time. The fall colours were just coming into their own and the crowds were kept to a minimum. The trails were easy and scenic. There were a couple of trails closed due to maintenance that seemed to be slow on the maintenance. I actually picked up a lot of downed limbs and trees myself.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Taylor Ziesmann,4,"Cross country skiing was fun, $30 for day pass for two people plus $45 for two people to rent skis, poles and boots. Nice Visitor centre but was truly busy by 1pm. Wished the skating trail was open but we came early in the season. Worth a visit and hope to come back during the warm months!"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Kaitlyn Bullen,5,Went in the winter to the skating Trail. It was magical. What a beautiful way to enjoy skating. Weekends get busy so go early to find a parking spot. They also have a fire pit so bring warm clothes so you can stay awhile.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Chris Thorn,5,"Great winter cabins! Very cozy! Hiking relatively easy if you don't want to rent snowshoes or skis...but you can! As a winter adventure(Really can't speak to summer) this place is top notch. Quiet, clean and lots of activities and places to get warm. Friendly staff too!
We'll be back!"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,kim Johnson,5,"Lovely park, worth exploring in the winter too... tons to do. Went in Sept last year and the bugs were surprisingly brutal for that time of year. Campsites aren't stacked on top of one another which is awesome. Usually a back country camper but this was a great place for car camping. Friendly staff, clean, quiet."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Piotr Lupa,5,Fire and Ice is an awesome experience. Worth the drive. Not the smoothest ice but you're skating through a forest trail!!! Also some parts are slightly uphill and others slightly downhill (I advise knowing how to slow yourself down)
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Chris Marshall,5,love going here in the winter to ski. trails are great and well marked. new lodge building is very nice. Also skated on the ice skating trail that runs in the woods and it was good too but of course bumpy.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Colleen Brailsford,5,Have skated on the track several times. Great place for family fun. So many things to do. New   Lodge is awesome.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Sergio Sarmiento,5,"Amazing experience. We did Fire & Ice night skating and it was awesome. Torches lighting up the ice trail was awesome and even though it was Saturday night, it wasn't as packed as i expected it to be."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Lisa Bell,5,"My parents would take my brother and I camping here every summer. I like to camp in more secluded areas and they offer quite a few sites with a lot of privacy. Canoe rentals are safe and fairly priced. I love the bike trails, beaches, ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Eric Bojmelgrin,5,"One of my favourite parks in Ontario. Great way to spend a week or a Weekend.  Camping sites afford enough privacy to make one feel as being one with the surrounding wilderness,  but with the reassuring knowledge that the comfort station ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Carol-Ann Riddle,5,"If you will be camping with your dog, pick a location close to the ""Pet Exercise Area"". You can enjoy sandy beach areas where your dog can go in the water with you and run around. Also try a rope from one tree to another with a carabiner for your dog to roam tangle free as dogs must be leashed at camp all sites."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,arshpreet singh,5,"We planned our trip one week in advance. Luckily the weather was really good. Snow was fresh. They have very proper arrangements for skates, skating trial, skies, sking trials, lockers, washrooms . Good warm area to help you stay warm. Looking forward for our next trip."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Andrew Webber,5,Arrowhead park has a great trail system and an overall great camping experience. The new Welcome Centre is excellent with a great space to warm up in the winter and get year round rentals. Staff are super friendly and helpful!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Todd Hunter,5,"Rented a cabin here twice, very cozy this weekend while in the -20's . Ski trails are awesome, 1.3km ice skating trail (clean by zamboni) is very good and night skating in torchlightis pretty cool. Comfort station and warming fires also. Snow shoeing trails I have yet to do."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Anwaar Murtuza,4,"Nice little park, the river bend is a must see when visiting Arrowhead. Hiking trails are good and for the average to moderate hikers. The campsite are good and have good privacy. The washrooms need a little update, the taps would not hold the water running for more than 2 seconds. Overall a nice place."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Edriss Sydeqi,5,This park at fall time is absolutely beautiful! The change in tree colours and the reflection of it makes it a perfect getaway from the city or to enjoy a nice day in the nature. There is a lot of camping spots and parking available in ...
Arrowhead Provincial Park,vnixon33,4,"Large, beautiful sites for camping, gorgeous beaches and lots of fun things to do with kids.  However, there are far too many outhouses that need to be changed to flush toilets on the camping roads.  The beaches also really need to have ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Patty Townsend,5,"My favourite provincial parks.  Big, clean, well maintained RV lots and lots of hiking trails.  We will be back."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Andrew Kim,4,"I have camped here three times, all in the East River campground. All three campsites were spacious and well maintained. Two inner sites (#326 & #333) were quite private and located well apart from neighbours, but the other (#347) near ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Katelyn Mast,4,I love this place! It's one of the nicer provincial parks with reach of toronto! The trails are picturesque and their winter activities are super. If you are thinking about it try their roofed cabin accommodations. They may be a little pricey but they are great!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,ibrar ahmad,5,View is awesome. Pictures are in my laptop but something you really going to enjoy with your eyes. Must visit place for fall
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Keren Wise,5,"Such a beautiful provincial park during the fall season. 

The prime time to visit and witness all the trees changing colour is mid-october. 

The park is very well taken care of, the atmosphere is gentle and free from societal smells and sound. 

Don't miss out on arrowhead provincial park or you'll ACTUALLY regret it!"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,shaun davidson,5,Great time skating the trail. Can't wait to do it again.

Arrowhead Provincial Park,George Pazmino,5,AMAZING night skating.... hiked to stubb falls! Great little trail.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Scott Payette,4,"We took our children camping here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The best thing here is location, being 10 minutes from all the restaurants of Huntsville meaning no more cooking and eating in a tent when it is ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Vishwanath Keerthi,4,Best hangout spot just 2 hours drive from Toronto and in winter it’s best to do ski and skating
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Arshpreet Singh,5,Awesome experience. People were there to guide for skieng. Will be visiting again
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Hazim Aldujaili,5,One of the most beautiful site in Ontario had many interesting things to know and see... Also there is a very nice campground in the heart of that interesting area.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Girlonfire Girl8on1fire,5,Most beautiful sites I've ever seen  i totally recommend this camp ground for everyone each sites are spaced out really good to give privacy to you to us as well as they have  a lot of amazing hiking trails. you can also go canoe ...
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Auptechs Ostaszewicz,5,"Absolutely amazing camp ground. This place has the best Northern beach area I've ever been to. No weeds, no rocks gorgeous beach, clean water so enjoyable. Down side is the signage isn't the best for navigation while inside the park. Some of the washroom facilities are not the best but an amazing park."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Alex McDonald,5,Beautiful park. Clean and well kept. Very good trails. Our dog loves the dog beaches especially the one at the far end of Arrowhead lake. We'll be back!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Albert Leung,4,It's nice but started to rain soon after we got there. Lake is nice too. Didn't find any high grounds to shoot fall colors.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Steve Brackett,5,"Beautiful park.  Great river for kayaking with first-time kids.  Decent beaches, hiking trails, and super private sites in the east river section.  Minutes to Huntsville if you need ice cream."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Bin Ou,4,Lots of activity to do seems like a beatiful place in summer
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Tiffany Cariaga,5,Amazing park in the winter time!  We came up here to go skating in the forest.... that’s right in the middle of the forest!! It was great!  Make sure to come earlier as it gets quite busy!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Laura Gardner,5,Beautiful trails. Very well organized
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Jeffery Meyer,5,Nice place to camp with kids. Beaches are small and safe.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Natalie E,5,Had a great time at Arrowhead Provincial Park. The washrooms were older but cleaned daily. The showers did flood up the whole room and had no ventilation. The lot sizes were large and very shaded which helped on the hot days. This is a ...
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Steve Gregory,5,Had a great time even though it rained for 14 hours on Wednesday. Hard to navigate through this place to find anything though. Great trails and a great place for the dog to swim and play. Wish I could have stayed longer. I'll be back next year.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Celine Potter,5,"Beautiful park, very well maintained, fantastic and helpful staff."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Kyle Gizas,4,"Beaches are pretty nice. Went mostly for some hiking trails. The trails are pretty nice but wish they were marked better. Hard to tell which trail was what. The falls trail is nice, a beautiful lookout spot"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,B.B D,5,"Fantastic in winter. We mainly come skating on a  skating trail, which runs through the forest."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Galactus Fantasticus,5,I love this provincial park but this year it seems a bit disorganized. They're switching around the park stores to their new building at beach 2 but the transition is pretty bumpy. Quiet and great for families - the fishing this week was ...
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Jay Brodie,3,Went out camping here with my 5 year old for the weekend. The parks is nice. The sites are very spread out which is great as you don't feel like you are sharing a site with others. Now for the not so great stuff. The non comfort station ...
Arrowhead Provincial Park,D W Hissem,5,"Beautiful, and the bugs; the relaxing buzz of a warm blanket of bugs... An absolute visit in the falls when the local trees are in full colour... Something just short of heaven!"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Dan Pronovost,5,"The best cross country ski trails in the area. And, the cabins are perfect for renting! And, don't forget to try out the circular custom skating track they maintain. So much fun."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Zeiad El Kady,3,"Nice park but signage sucks and the map isn't very helpful either.  Very easy to get lost. Too much time spent trying to find stuff.  Dog exercise area is very nice, beach like."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Spud Ramsay,5,"Great place for Nordic Skiing, snowshoeing and skating."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Colin Haskett,5,The ice trail was a great family outing.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Craig McRae,5,It’s so beautiful up here!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Serge V Louise,5,"Beautiful place not too far from the city. In the week not as busy compared to weekend but the spots are relatively private and easy to set up in. The lake is pretty and good for a canoe, Nice beaches and the hikes have good views. Stubb's Falls is a must see on the hike."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,n alexander,3,"A nice place. A lot of poison ivy all over, even in the camping areas. You need to keep your pets and children away from it."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Darin Higgon,5,"Nice sites, nice swimming, nice hiking, nice facilities. Over the hill so you don’t get highway noise (it is quiet), yet close to town if you want to explore. This park checks all the boxes!  A favourite for frontcountry camping!"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Batool Kanaan,5,"We had a wonderful experience at this park! The park is just stunning. We took our own kayaks with us and went out on the water. It was a cold weekend (May24 weekend) but kids were still swimming. Easy to park, easy to navigate, would recommend this park if you are looking for some calm kayaking or swimming."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Mark Doctoroff,4,"This provincial park {part of the extensive Ontario park system] offers nature lovers some wonderful experiences--- whether in winter , for cross country skiing, skating... and in the summer the swimming in pristine circumstances are ..."

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Moe Youssefian,5,An awesome place for all seasons....
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Neha Shetty,4,Loved the place and the lake at night was beautiful ❤️ Created some beautiful memories.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Steven Secord,4,Great park with some nice hikes. Only issue was that the bugs (mosquitoes and black flies) were just horrible at this time of year (late June). Nothing park can do about that but a warning for anybody planning to go up then. Also check process needs to be streamlined when it gets busy despite it not being the high season.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Leila Binesh,5,"Lovely place. It was my second time here and we had a cabin. Very convenient and comfortable.  The only concern is all cabins are located inside ""radio free"" zone. Means no music/dance/ even hard laughing at all! That is weird to me that ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Vitaliy Ivanov,5,"Great place to go camping, canoeing, and the Big Bend is a peaceful and wonderful natural phenomenon"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Tammy Graley,5,"Love how big and private the sites are. The new store is convenient if you forgot something from home, but its not too big. It has ice so that is a bonus!"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Kanuk On The Road,4,"Overall a great park.
Lots of dog restrictions.
But still many trails for hiking and access to water. 
Was there early October. Colors ar beautiful and its less crowded.

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Denicia And Elliot,5,"Great campground for family fun. We couldn't find a play structure for our three year old, but it didn't matter because the water was so warm and clean that we spent most of our time in the lake. Nice campsites, clean comfort stations, and great staff! They have a very nice dog swimming area as well."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Jen Jermey,3,Park is nice but the sites are tough to get into with a 24ft travel trailer.  The sites are listed for trailers this size but there is very little space to back up and maneuvre the trailer in.  You can get in with the help of someone ...
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Nicole Peever,5,It was our first time to Arrowhead and we loved it. Very private sites. Only downfall was are friends were staying in a different row there is no short cut access had to walk all the way to the end and Down to the next area all the way down.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Jaxon Crosmas,4,"Stayed at Arrowhead Provincial Park for a few nights with some friends. Amazing scenery with lots of things to which makes for a great getaway for family and friends. Just make sure you bring bug spray, many bugs near the lakes for sure ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Tuuluu wag,5,"We stayed in South Lumby. Sites were spacious, flat and mostly sandy. The comfort station there was ok. Showers were intense. Both extremely cold water, and a stream of water that could nearly remove skin! Beaches were busy but nice. ..."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Liz Kamerman,5,Arrowhead is always a favorite. Big bend lookout is a breath taking view and stubbs falls is amazing. The 3 other trails are good as well. Favorite section is roe. But east river and lumby are nice as well. New park store is nice as well.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Curtis Field,4,"Really nice park. Unfortunately there isn't much enforcement on loud screaming children and families who don't have respect for other campers. I'd come back, but would make sure the park is high in vacancy."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Sarah MacKenzie,5,I would so love to Winter Camp here the kids would love to be here on weekends.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Lei Cai,5,The cabins are great for winter camping.

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Heather Marchment,5,Ice trail was really great!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Daniel Hefford,4,This park is well organised. There are several beaches. Tons of campsites and quite a few hikes. In the winter there are several cross country ski trails. There is also a really cool ice skating loop. Stubb's falls trail has a really nice (but popular) waterfall. The big bend lookout is worth the 5 minutes of your time!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Jennifer Tyson,4,Beautiful Beaches and hiking trails. Only complaint is some of the sites are not very private. Otherwise it is a great park to visit.
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Sahar Faizi,5,Great experience. Camping here was fun. Very clean campsites.

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Nite Rider,5,Very private campsites. Absolutely the best provincial park around that hasn't butchered their park into a camping parking lot. They have maintained a rustic feel. East River campsites are the best - you literally cannot see your closest ...

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Morvarid Sadinejad,5,"I love the way it's full of bushes and trees . 
Clean washrooms and nice walking trails."
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Glenn Rebello,5,As beautiful and scenic as this place may be there is an equally good chance that you will return home stricken with mosquito bites unless u have dabbed yourself with sufficient insect repellent cream all over. ALL OVER!!!
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Larry Radzio,4,Great family time and experience
Arrowhead Provincial Park,James Pang,3,"It's 6 degrees
 Can't ski, can't skate, can snowshoe. But managed to hike 6 km"
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Dalton King,4,Very large park that is well kept. The skating loop through the trees is beautiful but we had gone when the weather was starting to warm up so the ice was pretty bad and I decided to walk after doing one lap. There is a trail close to the ice loop that leads to a small waterfall that is really nice.

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Roland Pfluegl,5,Fantastic spot. Campsites are not on top of each other. Many activities available

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Backyard Homestead,3,It's a good park but could do with some fixes for the disabled as the disabled bathroom and disabled shower do not have any signs on state that it is a disabled wash my shower and the paths to some of the beaches should be fixed as they are not very accessible for people that are disabled but other than that its a good park
Arrowhead Provincial Park,Andrew Shuttleworth,4,"Arrowhead is a great place to spend a few days with the family and my two dogs. Be sure to check out the Big Lookout, Stubbs Falls and the brand new visitors center."

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Eva Sidoti,1,The park is very run down (lots of dead trees standing and bush over growth...and therefore bugs). My reason for giving 1 star is that while we where on our campsite a 30 foot tree fell on our site and knocked down and broke a fire pit ...

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Shivangi Trivedi,5,"Have been to many provincial parks in Ontario, this is one of the best! Very close to ON 11, wonderful park. Easy hikes with option of parking close to attractions if one doesnt want to hike.

Arrowhead Provincial Park,Kathie Greer,4,This is a very nice park and well worth visiting. I think their reservation fee for camping that is in addition to the camping fee itself is greedy and ridiculous. Take a cc for guarantee people.
