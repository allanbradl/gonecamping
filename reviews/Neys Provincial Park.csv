Neys Provincial Park,Laura Machacek,5,"Seriously, this place is heaven. We just finished the Lake Superior Circle Tour and Neys was our favorite place to camp. Peaceful, sandy beach, on the most picturesque bay. Our six year old son couldnâ€™t stop building with the copious amounts of driftwood on the beach. A must-stay if youâ€™re in the area!"
Neys Provincial Park,E D,5,"Very nice campground, well kept.  Privite campsites.  Really nice walking/hiking trails and an off leash dog beach!  Informative visitors centre and has little events/info sessions scheduled.  Would definitely go again."
Neys Provincial Park,Sandra Predinchuk,5,Beautiful. Majestic Lake Superior.  Good lots. And lots for the family to do. Beautiful park for camping. Highly recommend
Neys Provincial Park,Joel Gullickson,5,"The beach here is like being at the ocean - you just need a little bit of imagination.  Campground areas 1,2, and 3 have sites that have paths directly to the beach.  These areas can be a bit busy.  If you prefer a bit more privacy, area 4 is great for this but it is not next to the lake."
Neys Provincial Park,Andrea Fehler,5,"Fantastic park. I will return often. Amazing Beach, huge campsites, the stars were incredibly bright, the visitor centre is fantastic for being small, great interpretive programs for the kids and adults alike."
Neys Provincial Park,J. Coward,5,One of the nicest provincial parks I've been to. Amazing history. Beautiful beaches. Great staff.
Neys Provincial Park,Karen Meinders,5,This is a beautiful location on the shore of Lake Superior. The beaches are sandy and the water is cool and refreshing. Definitely worth the trip ðŸ˜€
Neys Provincial Park,Michel Enns,5,"This is my favorite Ontario Provincial Park. It has a spectacular beach, some interesting history and what must be the best off leach dog area in the world. The location is a bit remote but if you are planning on camping anywhere nearby you should definitely check it out."
Neys Provincial Park,Bill Ducat,5,"Fantastic place, but don't underestimate the trails!"
Neys Provincial Park,Tom Fancsy,5,What a peaceful place e and such a serene window onto the awesomeness of Lake Superior
Neys Provincial Park,Regina Dotson,4,"The campground is lovely. Sites are big and heavily wooded. We have a 40 ft motorhome and were able to get into a site designated for an 18 ft. That being said, that staff at the gatehouse was not very competent. We were told to look at ..."
Neys Provincial Park,Chatravi K,5,"This is one of those really rare provincial parks. I feel like this should be a national park but that's just me. Absolutely stunning sights. Great for families, biking, hiking. Clean facilities and trails. Good staff"
Neys Provincial Park,Jilly Chinchilly,5,Absolutely stunning. The view at night with the moon over that gorgeous water is mystifying!! Terrace Bay always gives me good memories... It was the highlight of my travels in May and made my journey worth every minute. Please go see this place! They have moose!! :)
Neys Provincial Park,Rita Norell,5,Shhhhhh! Don't tell EVERYONE about this Edenesque northern paradise. This secret place is only for the hale & hearty. It helps to wear long underwear and wool garments. We shall return here until we leave this  good Earth.
Neys Provincial Park,Andrew James,5,Visited for the day - drove through and parked on a beachfront site for an hour to let the dogs get some exercise.  Good size park with lots of large wooded sites.  The beachfront sites weren't right on the beach but each had their own ...

Neys Provincial Park,Derek,3,"Very nice beach. Camping sites are just OK. A little tight with bush around which brings lots of bugs. I also hate having to search for my electrical box (what's up, Ontario Parks?!)"
Neys Provincial Park,Dottie Bisted,5,"Gorgeous park right on Lake Superior,  Laundry, restrooms and showers, electrical sites, but the posts are a ways into the woods so not very visible, you will need extension cords they also have some available for rent."
