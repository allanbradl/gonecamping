Long Point Provincial Park,Daniel Millar,5,"Amazing beach. You would honestly forget that you were in Ontario. White sands and crystal clear, warm and shallow waters. 
I always make the trek from Toronto once if not twice per year (AT LEAST)
Love it."
Long Point Provincial Park,Sage Bradbury,5,Beautiful! Sucked that there was no cell service way out there but it was still a lovely beach none the less! And they had a side for the dogs too which was great! My pup absolutely loved his big swim there last summer!

Long Point Provincial Park,House of beng beng blog,4,"Long point has a nice Long Beach, easy to get your own spot away from other people. Beach water temperature is warm. It‚Äôs all sands. No rocks .Perfect for smaller kids and dogs. Campsites are great especially the ones close to the beach. ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,Fig Toria,5,"I particularly want to review the ""Dogs Allowed"" section of Long Point Provincial Park.   We've often been to the ""normal"" beach, but after acquiring a couple of dogs in the last two years, we wanted to include them in our annual ""Beach ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,Amanda Bryce,5,"Went to the beach for the day. I couldn't find pricing information ahead of time, but for two adults, it was $14.50 which wasn't too bad. There were people parking outside of the park along the main street and entering the beach via ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,Mela O,3,Went in July 2018 and the water had too much debris for my liking. It took forever to find parking and then the beach itself had way too many people. Would not go back here.
Long Point Provincial Park,Karl Berzins,5,"Like any provincial park, well maintained with friendly staff.  Rates are, however, getting a little high for camping. 

We stayed at the Monarch and Firefly area.  Amazing site if you have kids.  Very close walk to the gorgeous beach, ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,Donald Yap,4,"Almost the perfect beach.  Decent fine sand and shallows forever.  Nice and warm water, great for the kids. The only problem is the bugs. The side of the point facing inland is a marsh, which means huge breeding ground. It's hard to ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,Christine Birch,4,The beach is fantastic! Tons of sand and great for the kids since it's shallow for quite a distance.  Unfortunately the mosquitoes were terrible when we went in mod July.  Luckily we found a device in Port Rowan to help with the mosquitoes at night so we could still enjoy our campfires!  We will definitely go back again!
Long Point Provincial Park,Louise Platiel,5,"Long, clean, sandy beaches great for families. We were there on a Monday and it was so VERY much nicer than Port Dover where the party crowd had taken over with loud music, booze and smoking YUK!  Had a peaceful day of fun and sun, water was beautiful.  Worth the entrance fee."
Long Point Provincial Park,Tony Laviolette,5,Great experience and historical place. So much I didn't know until you visit and read. And by far the best beach in South Western Ontario. Here's a little hint don't climb up the 50 foot sand dunes there are Pathways that get you to the beach LOL
Long Point Provincial Park,K C,4,Nice beach all sand and miles of space to spread out dor your own peace of sunshine. Park is clean and well looked after. Worth the day trip and picnic with the family. Dog beach also here and the sand is easy on your pups tender feet.
Long Point Provincial Park,Glenn Skitch,5,"This was a amazing place to camp. Washrooms and showers were free and clean. The lake is a bit cold but the waves were fun. Lots of sites have paths straight to the beach, Lake Erie. Overall awesome place to camp, I would definitely recommend this park for future campers!"
Long Point Provincial Park,Dahod King,4,"Awesome beach and quiet long.  Early you go, you get better parking.  Get your own food, water was warm enough on a day like 35¬∞C. Your own tent, beach umbrella or canopy would be very helpful.  Lots of cottages and RV park.  About 2 hrs driving from Toronto. Multiple route options before you hit hwy 6."

The weather here ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,ielung Yap,3,"Visit the park in early August. Beach is long and sandy, but you need to step out far before overcoming the shallow water to swim. It is like giant wading pool for kids to enjoy. There are lots of green beach mosquito ready to stink your ..."
Long Point Provincial Park,crawford melvin,5,"Very beautiful in the morning at sunrise, picnic benches for meals, and nice refreshing water."

Long Point Provincial Park,PIX XX,4,Great long stretch of sandy Beach.  Plenty of space and parking.  Washrooms and water to clean off with.  Best to come on a weekday as it can get packed with people.  Bring an umbrella or tent as it will get hot.  Water is Sandy and shallow.
Long Point Provincial Park,D Huot,4,"We come here every year.  The beach is amazing!  Kids love playing in the sand and swimming in the water.  Washrooms are close by.  They can get busy and super dirty at times...this year they were very clean - quite impressed!

Long Point Provincial Park,Bryor Atchison,3,"Went there expecting an isolated area with trails, lots of trees and your basic camping experience. But it is home to hundreds of locals, people with cottages, etc. Not very private, not much to do besides go to the beach. Our campground was all sand too, so that was fun."
Long Point Provincial Park,PLEASE DONTJUDGE ME IVE NEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH,5,Great place for camping and swiming one of the best places to go for swimming and camping in the sandy areas
Long Point Provincial Park,Teri Severn,4,Great park. I'd definitely recommend Monarch or Turtle Dunes sites over Firefly as Firefly looked to be like a parking lot. The showers between Monarch and Firefly can also get quite busy. The beach is wonderful and the dog beach portion is a good size.
Long Point Provincial Park,Natalie E,5,Our favourite Southern Ontario Beach. The park has such a huge beach and you can walk so kilometres. Last year the water was extremely high up so there was less sand so less space but that was still ok. The water is always warm and clear on sunny warm days. The sunsets are beautiful üòä
Long Point Provincial Park,Neil Haslam,4,Amazing beach. Some campsites are really sandy. Most have good privacy. Good family camping spot.
Long Point Provincial Park,Tino G,4,"Beach is beautiful! Can't say it enough.  But lack of garbage drop points make it easy for ""some people"" to leave their garbage behind. (So annoying)  Lots of parking! ...and lots of bugs at night."
Long Point Provincial Park,Logan Hawkins,5,"Great place for a family trip, go to the beach, park, or even put the boat out on the water. Amazing place!"
Long Point Provincial Park,Louise Dulong,1,So disappointed. I have difficulty walking an not being able to get to the beach with it climbing and dunes was very disappointing. Spent many childhood memories in Long Point. Coming into the point is now a private beach.. Really.. The only flat spot to get to water.. Sorry.. Won't be back üòïüòï
Long Point Provincial Park,SippinTea,4,Went camping and went to the beach. Good prices and nicely put together. Not sure if this was just from the hot sun or if it‚Äôs always like this but the sand was super hot and felt like my feet were burning.

Long Point Provincial Park,James Helmkay,2,"Nice beach, shame about the mosquitoes! The absolute worst mosquitoes I‚Äôve ever experienced. So bad that you cannot be out after dark. You can shower in bug spray, burn the candles, it doesn‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôll be swarmed by mosquitoes. Bug ..."
