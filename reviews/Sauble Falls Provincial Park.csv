Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Don Muir,1,"We stopped for a look around the falls, quite nice until we left. Needed to use the toilets in the parking lot above the falls where we parked. We have never been more shocked and disgusted in a Provincial Park facility. Excrement ..."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Andrea Hajt,3,"Decent campground at Sauble Falls and close to Sauble Beach. Great bathroom, shower facilities. We did see 2 wood roaches during our 4 day stay though."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Jodi Belec,5,Excellent customer service and friendly staff. Good site sizes easily accessible. We had parking for 4 cars when friends surprised us with a visit. Short day trip to Sauble Beach was heavenly. Short day trip to Tobermory was ...
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Meagan Hull,2,These grounds are the least private of all the provincial parks I‚Äôve ever been to. We could see the cars on the highway from our campsite... the highway was on the other side of the fence... not impressed. I would go to a private park next time I‚Äôm in Sauble area
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Lauren Osrecak,4,Went here to check out the falls and it is very beautiful. It is a tourist attraction so in the warm weather it is packed with people. Parking is expensive but there are a few cheaper lots if you are willing to walk a few minutes. The ...
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Tommy Gunn,5,Went camping here for the first time with my wife during Fall and enjoyed the beautiful falls and unique rock formations. Was even lucky to spot salmon in the water.
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Colin Benninger,1,"I have been camping at provincial parks since inception, and my friends and I have been going annually for nearly a decade, never before have I dealt with such strict noise policies. We booked a group site, and had about 10 people with ..."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Fanny Belcoski,5,Beautiful park worth going .  5 minutes from Sauble beach. Beautiful campsites. Nice clean facilities. Very nice staff. Lots to do in the area.
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Rachel Shafer,5,"We camped here and have an awesome experience. The girls that work there were all super friendly and very helpful. The site was very large and it had a cooking grate over the fire pit, thought that was pretty cool. It was very lovely and very minimal bugs and mostly just at night mosquitoes."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Robert Harker,5,Incredible natural wonder where you are allowed to swim and dive off the falls. People were swimming the rapids and jumping off the falls into the pool.  Great fun for old and young ... highly recommended.  No admission fee but there is ...
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Raj Paleja,1,"Due to the character limit, my full review cannot be provided here. Please refer to the attached screenshots."

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Siddiq Rizwan,5,It was a very nice experience. Felt very happy. I would rate it 5 stars. Happy Entry and Felt sad to miss that place. #nice #good #happy #google #maps #googlemaps #localguides #contributions #localguide #exiting #missing #feeling #place
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Marc Daguerre,4,Tree coverage was fantastic since it provided much needed shade during noon day sun. Our lot size was kind of small compared to some of the other ones. Would be a good idea if they had dimension to the sites so that you can reserve one that fits your needs. The main beach area is only a few kilometers down the road.üëç
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,BeeFound Business Optimization Inc.,5,Great provincial camp grounds. Staff were very friendly at the front gate and make checking in very pleasant. Camp sites are not very private but overlook the river which is nice to wake up too. If you forget something these are several stores close to the camp. The river was a blast to spend some time in.

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Kris Smith,3,"To busy with people, find a better time to visit"
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,M Kellington,4,"This Park is very nice and very small. Its lane ways are the old style narrow one lane roads that provincial parks used to have.
The waterfall is amazing but it's hit and miss depending how high or low the river is.
The park is split in ..."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,John Maier,4,We went the first week in May and had a great time!  The park was almost empty so the kids had free reign for biking and exploring.  We stayed in the north section and the bathrooms were great.  The fishing was easily accessible and ...
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,bindu saju,5,"Beautiful falls! It is a hidden gem. The parking is plenty. They have camping facilities as well. Clean washrooms with running water. Shower stalls for campers are also there.

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,David Harms,4,"Fun to walk around.  It's really about the nature and nothing to do with value added.  A little pricey seeing as it doesn't appear to be maintained, but rather capitalizing on work done long ago.  Should be free, though the brief boardwalk would cost something to fix."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Gordon Smith,5,"The most fun I've had in a long time, the Falls are cascading and you can walk out from the boardwalk and fight the current.It was just over 5.00 to park. You are close to the amazing Sauble Beach and check out the Sauble Sands just up ..."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Yeganeh Mehrbod,5,"Breathtaking views! Great for fishing if you're interested, and great for a one day getaway."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Ramsha Qureshi,5,"It's a great park for taking a stroll, having a picnic, taking pictures, and generally enjoying yourself. It's a great place for family. There is a smaller parking spot past the main provincial park that allows you to park for hourly ..."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Erna's Adventures,5,This is such a beautiful place its not a high falls but pretty
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Brad Shaw,4,Really nice spot to look at the falls. They are small but beautiful. Parking is a bit pricey even though there isn't much to do or see. Maybe stop here for a picnic as it's a great spot for that.
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Kirthiga C,5,The falls and the park was great. Even kids can walk through the falls with parents supervision of course. A very nice and shady place to do picnicking.
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Budgie Grotesque,5,Park is very well maintained and washrooms nice and clean.  Campsites have some trees and good privacy on most sites.   One of the smaller provincial parks.  Sites available right on the river so you can launch your canoe right from your site if you want.

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Edward Nielsen,4,Beautiful part with excellent beach just minutes away.  Only downfall are the sites are so close to each other.
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Kara Prescott,5,Beautiful place to visit and jump off the falls. There is a small fee for parking.
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Rose Sirois,3,"We stayed in the radio free zone, but that did not guarantee quiet.  Unlike private campgrounds, there is not a designated family zone.  
We were awoken the first morn at 0630 by a screaming child. On the second night ~1130, we were stirred by the sounds of a (different) wailing child."
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Melodie Messina,5,"Been going to the Tent & Trailer park across the road for a few summers now. Wouldn't go without spending some time at the falls. The falls are beautiful with lots of little spots to check out. Play area for the kids, canoe and paddle ..."

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,TheVolvotech,1,Rangers should be paying more attention to the  deteriorating bathroom conditions than noise on sites. Bathrooms need a lot of attention. 2 inches of water in the women‚Äôs bathroom

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Kawartha Lakes Media,3,"We camped here, in our trailer, in 2015. A typical Provincial Park with some beautiful scenery.

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Ligi George,4,Awesome expereince
Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Andrew de Boer,4,The falls are the best part of this campground. They are low and slow moving enough that even children can play in them. Definitely worth the trip.

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Scott w,1,"Nothing but harassment. With 5 kids ages 6, 8,9,10 and 14.  Having a normal conversation with the 14 yr old after 11 pm and told to be quite   Unbelievable. Never again. I guess I should be texting to my kid after 11 pm.  "

Sauble Falls Provincial Park,Bogdan Airinei,3,"Surrounding area is great. Some campsites are downright horrible as far as privacy is concerned. The park rangers are way too strict and are out to sap the fun out of a weekend under the stars. If I wanted to go to bed at 11, I'd be staying at home."
