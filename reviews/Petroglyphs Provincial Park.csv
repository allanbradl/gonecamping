Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Corissa George,4,Always saw a sign for this place & never stopped to check it until recently. Great learning experience for our little ones but also ourselves. So neat! Perfect educational spot. Long drive in off the main road but we‚Äôll protected. Clean & maintainers nicely!
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Krystal M,5,I'm so impressed with the way that Ontario Provincial Parks has both preserved and continues to protect this sacred site. Staff were very friendly and approachable. Being of First Nation ancestry....I also felt the staff made great ...
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Ian McLeod,5,"Amazing place. The energy you could feel.  Mike the warden was full of knowledge and a joy to talk with.
I look forward to doing a night visit and hear the water run when the times are correct. 
If you want to see a truly amazing native ..."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Greg Enright,4,"Great walking tour of ancient human art that has been preserved from the elements for posterity. Truly amazing to behold. An absolute must, at least once. We owe that much to our ancient predecessors who worked so hard to create these."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Luc√≠a Subatin,5,"Nice hiking place to visit for the day from Toronto. The drive was about 3 hours, parking costs 13 CAD and it is advised to bring your own food and water. On a fast walking pace both circuits can be completed in 3 hours. Stopping around ..."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Stephen Chen,5,"No photographs allowed of the petroglyphs, which are protected by a ranger-supervised enclosure as it is an active spiritual site used by the First Nations. Hence, it is a peaceful and contemplative space infused with the scent of recent smudging."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,John Ivel,3,"It seems like a nice place, but little of it made any sense to me. Your experience will probably be more educational than my own. What are ya gonna do."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Pat Ling,5,We found this by accident when researching what to do in the area.  It‚Äôs amazing the petroglyphs have survived all this time and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre preserved in a building from further damage.  An important spiritual place and thank you to ...
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Natalia Ourban,5,"I visited it several years ago and it was a wonderful and educational experience. If you are looking for something unusual to see, Petroglyphs would not disappoint you. Beautiful turquoise lake ( mind you, you cannot swim there, it is a meromictic lake), and of course Teaching Stones.  Highly recommend!"
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Ian Leslie,5,Very interesting site. Wonderful staff. The park is well maintained and the interpretive centre is very informative. The site itself is amazing. There is a nice gift shop too.
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Kim Macdonald,5,"Attended the special evening presentation put on by Ontario Parks. Extremely well done, powerful, very respectful of First Nations. It drives home how much we can still learn from First Nations, their deep connection to nature, and the ..."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,GN 2019,4,"Great place but wear walking shoes and a headlight works best, sold on premise!"
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,James Bonney,4,"Visited first in early 80‚Äôs before the structure was built over them. I remember being able to walk all over the glyphs and looking back it was obviously pretty disrespectful. I was 6 or 7 years old though, what did I know? Anyway, ..."
Petroglyphs Provincial Park,Jon Hines,5,This historical site seems well managed. The visit was informative and enjoyable. No picture taking allowed.
