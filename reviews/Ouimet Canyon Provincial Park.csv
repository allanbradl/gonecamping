Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park,Stewart Slaymaker,5,"Wow, a stunning location. The drive off the highway to access the canyon is well worth it. There is a short and easy trail that takes you to two view points over the canyon. There are limited facilities at the park."
Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park,Gayle Labuz,5,"An easy trail that takes you to two lookouts over the canyon.  Signage at the lookouts explain how the canyon was formed, as well as info about the plant life there. Self serve pay station with a fee of $2 per person . Definitely worth the visit"
Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park,Courtney Kaspardlov,5,Though it's pretty far off the highway it is definitely worth the trip at least once! Beautiful sights to see! Easy & quick trail.
Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park,Joel Barter,4,"This place is beautiful and stunning. It was a quick stop and actually smaller than I had expected. I knew the ziplining and what not were way over priced so I decided to fly it instead.
Check out the shots I got. Sorry for the window reflection on some of the shots."
Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park,Andrew D.,5,20 mins from the hi way but well worth it for the 15min hike to see an amazing place.
Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park,Bill Hanson,5,Stunning Canyon. My only suggestion would be to increase the length of trails surrounding the canyon; it's a beautiful area - more time to explore/view would be appreciated.
