Woodland Caribou Provincial Park,Dwight Bilodeau,5,Carroll lake lodge is an amazing place to stay for fishing.  Best of service.
Woodland Caribou Provincial Park,Gregory Hill,5,"I have been a long time Quetico trekker-this Park is incomparable! Fabulous fishing, well maintained portages without the technical aspects of the Quetico, great campsites and a great outfitter (Red Lake Outfitters) who actually goes into the park. I have visited the BWCA and Quetico for over 50 years and I was WOWED!"
