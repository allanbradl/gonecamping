Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Amrith Nair,1,"Edit: The park is not worth if we just want to visit and enjoy the scenery as the entry fee is too expensive. I would suggest that the park facilities like golf,  animal farm may have a price but if we want to just go there and see the ..."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Greg Clarke,3,I like the park for mountain biking. I mainly ride on the east side of the park (Oakville side) from the campground area. I am getting annoyed with the number of dogs who are running leash free but are not trained to do so properly. I ...
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,VJ,5,This is a nice little park with easy to do trails for everyone. Fall colours are nicely visible given the right timing. Great for a simple day trip from Toronto. There's plenty of parking and picnic spots as well and the trail maps they provide are very useful.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Rolando Tecson,5,"This park is a wonderful get away from the ""city"" life of Burlington.   It's not like say Algonquin park with dense forests and a remote escape but it's more prairies and fields which has a beauty in all its own and perfect for sun and ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Rad Sin,1,"We've visit a lot of parks and conservation area. Bronte creek just made it to the bottom of my list. It may be good for picnics but not for hiking. The trails are not clearly marked, no blazes to be seen and the trails are all flat and ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Vicky Gagnon,5,"Surprising place considering you are near from Toronto! Loved the place, it's quiet, friendly staff, showers are great and clean. Feels like you are really in the woods but in the middle of a suburban. From my tent site, I didn't hear ..."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Louis,5,"I’ve been coming to the day-use part of this park for more than forty years. It feels like home to me. There are hiking paths, lots of forest, farmed fields, and large open spaces, and, of course, Bronte Creek, where you can watch salmon ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Jay s,1,"Thanks Rad. I am currently looking at booking I camping trip and I understand your review, but their response was what is turning me off of the park. Bronte Creek management just lost my business. I will be booking somewhere else.

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Rhonda Barron,2,I usually enjoying going there. I'm have been going there for 3 yrs. But recently I had a bad experience. I had my trialed parked there for 2 weeks. I was to pay  but I didn't get in time to pay so they gave my spot away. I had a family ...

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Angela Mayer,5,"Little known trail on east side of Bronte River, north of Dundas, north of provincial park.

Stretches for kilometers,  even north of 407 overpass."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Mina Mars,5,"Great park!! amazing nature walks, and the pool site is fantastic! Bring your own chairs, towels & umbrellas! always a great time at bronte"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Erin Hunking,3,The overall facility is looking a little run down.  The pool is still nice overall and is good for kids of all ages.  The trees that were planted are the wrong type and because of that aren't very big which causes problems with respect to sufficient shade.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Marco Liang,3,"Charge a ridiculous $17 for parking. Really expensive for a lone hiker. The pool is nice, the trails are nice, but I could hear noise from 401 all the time."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Mike Redgers,1,"I can’t understand why people would rate this so high. I took my son there today to see the animals and explore. Extremely limited, several exhibits were closed. I can’t understand how they can get away with charging nearly $20. Absolute ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,1 Sarhan,5,Nice place and nice scenery! Didn't expect to pay. But its $17 per car! Beautiful mountain bike trails and hiking trails! Some are intermediate and some are advanced! The place is a beauty and it has a nice farm to visit that shows the life of old farmers. Great for kids.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Brenda Metherell,1,I am a senior and went to the park on Sept 1 with another senior. We just wanted a nature hike. We were given a map at the entrance and parked in parking lot F. We started this walk and it was quite beautiful and the paths were easily ...

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,P Rego,5,Excellent place to spend the day. The barn with a indoor and outdoor playplace plus some animals. We spend the day at the pool and the evening at the barn. The kids love it. Lots of trails to enjoy a long walk. Washrooms are clean. There is a drinking water fountain near the barn and also at the pool entrance.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Pratik Patel,5,Well maintained big outdoor pool - 100% worth it.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Chris&Angela Brown,5,"Wasn't sure what to expect when we pulled into the park this weekend.  As strange as it sounds the first thing I thought was "" wow nice clean heated bathrooms"" which was a huge plus since it was cold out before we started to run....so ..."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,ceyhun cagliyan,4,Very nice place with many amenities including outdoor swimming pool and farm place
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Tyrone Murphy,5,"Great provincial park, that is conveniently located between Oakville and Burlington. Lots of things to do with the kids including a farm with a play barn. Great place to bike, hike, or just relax with the family. Highly recommended. Also has a great toboggan hill."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Michael Truong,1,"Parking was too pricey if you just want to check out the park for a few hours, attractions should be paid for on a case by case basis instead of being baked into the parking price"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Mark Strasser,3,GREAT park not to far away. Again for the long weekend ... the sites grass was not cut. Major shortfall .... Heights ticks fleas mosquitos and dangerous to even walk around.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Omar I,5,Nice escape from town. Properly carved and maintained trail. Huge Leash free zone for dogs to roam. Oh and Forgot the mention the beautiful view of creek from hill.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Calvin Pettinger,4,"I only ever go to Bronte for disc golf, but I try to make it out as often as I can. Great course for the area. Bring a few friends in one car, since entry to the park is charged by the carload."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Sameem Monzaviyan,4,We only accessed the pool area so this review is only focused on that. Glad to see life guards on duty at all times from all towers. Water was reasonably clean but not the cleanest. Entry to the park fees don't include the Pool area. Not ...
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Ruurd Offringa,4,"A nice park with plenty to do for kids, good picnic areas, and some nice shorter walks. You do hear the sound of vehicle traffic as you're close to major roadways, but it's not too bad. The cost: $17 per vehicle. Makes it a special treat destination and not a regular destination."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Marya Kalen,5,"A wonderful Oasis in the Middle of the bustling city. Clean, well maintained sites. Electricity only: no water hookups or sewers. Generally clean washrooms and showers, except on long weekends when the staff get a little overwhelmed. ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Simon Howe,5,"This is a beautiful provincial park.  The cities of Oakville and Burlington are growing up on either side.  As a Burlington resident I love bringing my family here.  Great hikes, scenery, and activities for little kids"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Michael Schmidt,4,"We love going to Bronte Creek! Play barn for kids, farm animals, learning centre, lots of open space for playing, forest tails for hiking. Large swimming pool, picnic areas, and more. Camping available at the east side of the park. DON'T USE THE POP MACHINES, THEY WILL EAT YOUR MONEY!"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Fayez Shazaad,1,"Too expensive of a park. Why have such a high price for entry. $17. Nope I'd much rather save that and go to a lot of other palces. Entry should be free or atleast cheaper, attractions should be paid."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,M. Coulson,5,Nice disk golf course!
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,M Jisri,4,Very nice provincial park with animals farm. Great experience for kids to see or even sometimes feed some animals. Good hike to the creek starts at the very end of area F.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Tim Ure,5,"Great experience. Camping for 2 nights. Sites were clean of garbage, facilities were pretty clean, showers were a little hot and not adjustable. Evening ranger shows were great for kids. Try to get a site near the park if you have kids, or farther away if you dont"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Sarah-Anne Smurlick,4,"A typical Ontario Provincial Park, thought it is now in the city, with a subdivision outside the gate and along property line. Could use more sites for ""big"" rigs.  On the other hand they offer Learn to camp (tent) program.  Rv pads aren't all level left to right. The park has a great leash free dog walking trail."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Scott Raju,5,"Very beautiful as to the area, great place to have a picnic small or bigger family's! A lot of information about the park and the family that lived there! Someone famous person from way in the past, animals and especially there are bathrooms!"

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Aron Reid,5,"Great park, good amount of restrooms and pretty well maintained .  They have some great events as well.  No EV charging however.

We come here for small races (5/10km) and always have a good time.  Parking can be a little pricey in my opinion."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,T A,5,"Great provincial park, entry fee of $17 per car is expensive but the massive pool (bigger than wonderland I think) makes up for it, as well as the trails that lead into the hill and a waterfall. Well worth it if you bring a full car with you."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Jay Lee,5,Excellent park. Really enjoyed the trail there.! Beautiful lookout.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Jessica Bautista-Jones,5,"Went there for a picnic, great park"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Brian Roberts,5,Great park! Lots of trails and things to do. One of our faves! We buy a summer pass every year now just for the amazing off leash area alone. Well worth the money.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Margaret Tufts,4,No 5 stars because no water hookup. Surprising wild space inside the city. The rangers are so helpful and the sites are private and very spacious!
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Matt Perry,5,"The camping at Bronte Creek is so close to home but a world away! Great facilities that are well maintained by friendly and competent parks personnel make for wonderful stays.

The leash free park and trails is huge and a fan favorite.

This is an amazing resource in the heart of the GTA."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Jorge Rodriguez,5,lots of green space...espacious trails...smood sound river....centenial trees and plenty of fresh air.....
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Jeff McConnell,4,"Nice facility, if a bit on the chilly side for the water temp. Bring a great deal of sunscreen, and bring some shade. The park desperately needs to tree up a bit in order to keep kids sun safe."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Athar Khan,4,Great place to have picnics and go on hikes. Nice playground for kids in a barn. They usually have interactive programs throughout the year. Downside is the parking fee of $17 per vehicle.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Hemant N,5,"Nice trail walks. Also has a Hindu ashes immersion site by the river. It's a bit of a walk through som nice farms but we'll worth it. Has some farm animals like goats, hens, cows, horses. Kids will love it. "
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,James Otterman,1,"As of Father's Day Weekend
No access to park from campground. 
Pool closed after driving over there.
No real shade. 
Over zealous security.
Could be good someday with allot more work but not there yet."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Joseph SummariTrOn,5,"Great air, relaxing scenery, and close to Mount Nemo and Rattlesnake Point. Love cruising these roads or stopping at the bunch of spots, even more than what I mentioned if you just keep going ;)"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Allen Teska,5,Great child friendly pool with gradual incline. You can pretty much bring anything you can wheel into the pool area which makes for convienient drinks and meals. Always lots of activities in the barn and for maple syrup and car lovers
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Alex Furman,5,Huge park with a lot of things to do. Good picnic sites. Great kids programs. Play barn for kids. Domestic animals. Hiking trails. Open year around. Big outdoor pool open in summer (admission is extra). 
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Lindsay Lam,4,"Clean pool for the amount of children. Excellent trails, cute animals, and a neat Victorian home to visit. Very quiet, with lots of tables to eat and bbq. Well maintained. A little bit expensive to access the park but it is worth it"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Émilie Morin,4,Nice little secluded camp sites very close to town. Unfortunately you can still hear the highway at night. But the coyotes were still louder than the cars ;-). It is also convenient location.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Jason T,3,Mediocre park. More of an $6 than $17 park. Animals for kids are pretty disappointing. No snack facilities. Their 4.3 rating overall baffles me.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Pooja Janmeja,2,"Have been to this park before but the parking staff were very unhelpful, rude and arrogant! Yes we know it is 30degrees and summer but even with seniors in the car they were not allowed to be dropped at the pool! Either they are trained ..."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Brendan McNulty,5,"Bang for the buck. One admission per car gets the whole carload in. Tonnes to do. Play barn. Live stock. Nature trails the creek. Park Ranger programs and activities leash free section in the park. Certain events have stuff to purchase, usually food n such."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Paul Davis,5,Great pool for the kids and pretty cool events :)
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Stephen Lue,4,"Great fun for kids. A huge wading pool with life jackets if needed, a barn that's been converted into a playground, and a very small petting zoo.
$17 per vehicle to enter the park. Pool admission $3.75/adult $2.75/youth. Barn playground $FREE."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Ryan McFee,4,"Great place but watch out for some walkers and dog walkers - they are getting aggressive. 

Also, doggie poop bags should go in the garbage can, nowhere else. 

Staff is very helpful here. "

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Amjad Mir,5,Very nice camping spots..good trails. There are limited washrooms but not bad.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Kevin J Smith,5,There are some great running and mountain biking trails on this side of Bronte Creek Provincial Park. They are accessible from a few different locations with one following the creek along the top of the valley with good views.
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Prachi Chiney,4,"It is a nice park for a day trip from toronto.really nice bike trails and barnyard for kids to play and pet animals.lots and lots of picnic spots.There is a paid outdoor pool ,but we didn't use it.
But the park entry fee of 17$ is a lot in my opinion.should be reduced to around 10-12."
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Olaf Alders,4,Getting to be a bit run down but the pool is still great fun and lots of nice trails. Watch out for dogs on the East side of the park. I was bitten bloody *outside* of the off leash area. Many dog owners treat it as a de facto dog park in the off season when it isn't staffed. Enter at your own risk. 
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Steve Brown,4,"Interesting place,lots of stuff to do,but weird that your only 2 minutes from civilization and can see people's backyard from your site"
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Cody Allsop,5,"Bronte Creek is great, it has hiking paths, walking paths, various locations to explore for children and there are also several areas that feature cows that are friendly. If you mountain bike there is an enjoyable mostly easy ride that ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Umair Mahmood,5,"Beautiful place, nice places for the charcoal bbq. Lots of walking and cycling trails nearby. Pool is also a good activity for the kids. "
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Joel Shantz,4,Really nice escape in the city. Go early and you can easily feel like you're the only one around at times. Pool looks really nice as well. Drawback is that the sound of the qew seems everpresent when you are at the bottom half of the park.  
Bronte Creek Provincial Park,umesh govinda,2,"Very badly mapped. No proper sign boards and directions. All you see is parking lot A, B, C, etc. And you are lost completely.
Was a frustrating experience for almost everybody. Nobody had a clue where to go and what to do.
Everybody was ..."

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Maruschka Ollivierre-Higgins,4,We went to the pool on Saturday but none of the signs said where the pool was. When we arrived the attendant at the gate said the pool was 500 away from capacity and said nothing more. We assumed there would be clear signage. We had to ...

Bronte Creek Provincial Park,Claudia C,5,"Great beach like pool, fun kids play barn (check hours) and cute animals! "
