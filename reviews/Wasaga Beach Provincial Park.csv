Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,tina,4,"If you have a dog, then this is the beach for you. Beach area 3 has a section for people that has dogs. The dogs must be on the leash at all times and you have to be in between 2 posts. It can get packed pretty quickly. The people are a ‚Ä¶"
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,pappa p,4,"Great place for a family beach day. You don't need to bring much and the water is awesome for young ones. Very shallow for a long way out. There is plenty of very cheap parking if you go across the street, don't bother with the central ‚Ä¶"
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Nenad Markovic,5,"It‚Äôs a nice place. Probably best area for swimming in Wasaga. 
Boat launch is there on the River side. Very wide. 
Huge parking area."
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Dhiraj D'Souza,5,We go three to four times in summer to Wasaga Beach. We head straight to Beach Area 1 which is more family oriented and sandwiched between the river and the beach. Plenty of washrooms and parking make this place a hit.
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,elaine power,5,"Loved it in October the bathrooms were open but nothing else except LCBO and one or 2 stores open. Lay on beach for hours. Unfortunately the sand fleas were bad,need to spray the beach so many little kids there."
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Taylor,2,"Very busy beach and very crowded. There was barely any room to sit on the beach or swim in the water. The water was full of seaweed and other gunk that you have to wade through. Lots of cool attractions though, there was a ferris wheel, ‚Ä¶"

Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Neil Zeidenberg,3,"Nice place to visit. Just not on a long weekend. Took an hour to find a place to park. People block the view of the water with their huge tents and umbrellas. In the water, people bring their big floats and walk backwards into other people. How rude!"
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Dennis Kuzmenko,5,Great place to spend a summer weekend.
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Michael Elzinga,5,A great place to spend a summer day. I suggest parking in one of the local lots as they most charge $5 for parking rather than $20 at the parks lot.

Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,Jim Watson,5,"Ok I am a bit biased here, the town of Wasaga invites me and several of my friends to kite fly for the July 1 weekend. So there is always lots going on and the beaches are full. There seems to be a good draw to the beach and supporting stores."
Wasaga Beach Provincial Park,tejal,4,Really nice and has free parking on Canada day but the stores are overpriced and the people who are performing usually suck and the roads are where the pedestrians walk so you almost die Everytime u cross the road and there's no s lot of ‚Ä¶
