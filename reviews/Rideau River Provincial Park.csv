Rideau River Provincial Park,ESHITA SHAH,5,"Place is well kept and maintained. Bathrooms we're dry, clean. The Park persons had bird spotting informative activity for kids. The camp site was good too. It can be great place for a day trip or picnic with family and friends. Parking fee/entry fee is about $15.00."
Rideau River Provincial Park,swarnjeet Singh,3,"It's a very good place for a family kids. You can do a lot of activities are there are two beaches for swimming. There's no lifeguard but the water is pretty shallow.
There are campgrounds different campgrounds in this area you can go ..."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Kevin Thompson,5,"was a little hard to find at first, but being our first time out here from alaska what do you expect right? quiet campground and well maintained. we will keep it on our list of nice RV parks to stay at!"
Rideau River Provincial Park,Jérémy Vachon,4,"Just on the outskirts of Ottawa, perfect if you just want to get away for a night or the weekend.  One side of the park is close to the highway, so a bit noisy at night.  Wood is kept in a dry place.  Only has one 3km hike.  Large beach."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Celene Tang,4,Quiet but small park. Wish I could have swam but the bacteria levels were too high. The prices of kayak rentals are honestly way too high so no one was on the water. The facilities are decent. But there isn't much to do without ...
Rideau River Provincial Park,Maria Yasnitsky,4,"Amazing Park, love the location. Very small amounts of mosquitoes. The sites are very reasonably sized. Small beach, very shallow water, lots of seaweed. Small gift shop available at the front entrance."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Bradley Hiemstra,3,"Bathrooms were very busy as there were not many and they were quite dirty. Nice camping sites and nice trail. The beach was very shallow, good for kids and bad for teens/ adults. The park's water went out on our last day. We will not be returning."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Arash Khajooeizadeh,4,Good beach right close to Ottawa West and relaxed environment
Rideau River Provincial Park,Chris Childerhose,5,"This place is a great place for family and friends to get together,have fun and get closer to them. Lot of area , camping sites, and playgrounds for the kids to get out of your hair if need be. I love it there and so does my family."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Jeff Chubb,4,"Just outside of Ottawa and easy to get to. This local campground has some great facilities and a solid beach, for the Rideau River of course. The only downside is how close it is to a busy road, so when in your tent at night, you can really hear the cars. Other than that, we always have a great time."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Kat Crow,4,"Nice shaded private campsites, cool playground, great picnic areas. The beach is tiny and shallow. More like a large bath tub than a place to swim."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Alicia Willmott,1,My friends got a site at this location and invited me to come up for the day.  I went to check in at the office and ask what I need to do as my friends had a site and see my options. The young man there was very nice and told me to do ...
Rideau River Provincial Park,Jay T,4,Great beach access with picnic tables for a family outing. I would give it a 5 out of 5 if it had access to any food. You can rent various aquatic crafts like paddle boards and kayaks.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Paul Merriam,4,"Standard Ontario provincial park tenting sites and firepits. Walking trail along the river, dock and large beach with change house and playground. Two ""comfort stations"" and a few privys. Elevated BBQ stations (like a hibachi on a post) ..."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Kyle Creelman,5,"Nice campground, very quiet. The beach is along a river and the water seemed quite murky."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Kyle Turner,5,"$16 entry at time of review. Water good temp. Shallow, less weeds than other areas. BBQ pits avail. Playground on site."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Kath Margaret,4,So quiet and peaceful here. Will definitely come back again. Great handicapped spots go pull in a trailer.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Melanie Edson Horner,2,"The park seemes to be run by students. After vague instructions where our pitch was, We drove around for ages trying to find it! Signage poor. We weren’t aware we had to fill water tank at dump station. Noisy, we were next to a road. Washrooms were dirty too. The river is nearby and very nice."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Mar R,4,"It is a very nice place to spend with family and friends, even if you want to be alone for the day, this is a good place to go read and or lay down on the beach, running or just bike. Also there is an area to camp."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Elijah Breeze,1,"The previous review perfectly describes our experience at this park - A group of people laughing, singing and chatting around a campfire who were given a $180 noise violation ticket. 

As the young park ranger (probably the same one as ..."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Francois Malette,3,The park itself is above average. Some of the staff were not the greatest. The supervisor did try and make a bad situation better.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Lyndsey Lawrence,5,"Loved it close to Kemptville in case you forgot something or want to get some food, groceries etc
Close to the hiway 
Friendly clean great campsites"
Rideau River Provincial Park,K S,1,"Definitely not the place if you’re trying to have fun!! 

This place is awful. Received a $180 ticket for sitting around the campfire and talking.

We were in a section of the park that was almost entirely empty. The “camp warden” (a kid ..."

Rideau River Provincial Park,JFrancois Carle,4,A nice provincial park near Kemptville and less than an hour's drive from Ottawa. Great for pick-nicks and simple water sports.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Isabeau Landry,4,"Small, clean beach, friendly staff. Clean bathrooms. Campsites are a good size."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Melanie Poirier,5,"Fireworks and the Tulip festival.
Always a good plan for the kiddos."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Claire ___,1,"Been to a lot of parks but, this has by far been the most problematic. It's great to employ younger people, however, when they dont do a damn thing and are ignorant, that's a problem! Driving around on their 4 wheelers laughing having a ..."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Abd Mawlawi,4,It's nice . But they should make price lower for daily  visitors .
Rideau River Provincial Park,Brian of Pemberley,3,Well serviced and maintained campground but not a lot to do and rather close to the highway. Ok for an over night stay or a weekend but not a full vacation.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Dhdnd Hsusbd,1,Brutal experince. Never go here if you go camping to actually “go camping” don’t bother bringing marshmallows or friends or anything to start a fire cause the minute you light that fire your on pretty boy “Sean’s” radar and your walking ...

Rideau River Provincial Park,Steve Pinheiro,5,Great camp sites. great place.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Peter Le,1,If youre going as a group ages 20-30 DO NOT waste your time. We were a group of 15 and kept getting pestered all weekend. Some of us drove for over 6 hours. Got a 180$ fine for loud noise. Neighbours did not hear us and it is FULLY UP TO ...

Rideau River Provincial Park,YJ Isaac Jeong,4,"It's a nice camping site close to a beautiful  town Kempville that means it's convinient for shopping ( 5 minute distance), but a bit loud due to traffic if you camp near the roadside. Recommend riverside."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Marge Simpson,5,Been here many times. Wonderful memories.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Chris Evans,4,"Nice park overall, good beach and surrounding area. Nice dock area to fish from. Could use a few more washrooms but not a deal breaker. Two parks for the kids to play at, both within a few minutes walk from one another. Would camp there again, no problem..."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Cameron McKenzie,4,"The park is great but yesterday August 6, there was no water in the park at all, means no washrooms, when it did come back on it was no drinkable, boil first warnings."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Cesar Hernandez,2,"Dogs admitted for pets lovers. Rideau River seams to be with lots of algees so not that great for swimming. Service personnel are great. There were 2 bathrooms and 4 showers though, so there was always a lineup for the bathrooms none for ..."

Rideau River Provincial Park,Mike Ellison,3,The park is good but the mosquitoes are really bad as soon as you get away from the beach. Avoid bug season if you can.

Rideau River Provincial Park,Kevin Gibson,2,Some sites are hard to get trailer into.
Rideau River Provincial Park,Hanna Le,4,"Love the views, and the friendly service. We also love the setting of the park with playground, hiking trails, boating dock and swimming areas. However, we were disappointed that we couldn't swim due to the bacteria notice. So we rented out the canoe and fishing rods and went fishing instead. "
Rideau River Provincial Park,Chris Radl,4,Generally clean.  Lots are large and very nice.  We do tent camping and it was ideal.  Beach is nice as well.   The camp ground is however lacking in facilities.  Bathrooms are clean but lineups were long.  For the size of the park I ...
Rideau River Provincial Park,Joanna Facey,1,"very disappointing.  The beach sections were extremely small and water would only go up to your waist at best, not bad if you have very young children.  The section that was designated for ""dogs"" wasn't even accessible, you had to go ..."
Rideau River Provincial Park,Gary Secord,4,"The week we were here it was very quiet even though our section was full, staff were great to deal with."
Rideau River Provincial Park,_____ H,2,"Poor example of a provincial park, no park staff were available over our entire visit, no map, no firewood, and nobody was available to check in with. Pretty noisy as well with the road on one side and the boats on the river. I'll skip this one next time."

Rideau River Provincial Park,Pete,3,The campground has very poor drainage leading to very muddy sites and a heavy presence of mosquitos. The lack of natural drainage is compounded by the facility's failure to maintain ditches; the remnants of ditches can be seen in some places.

Rideau River Provincial Park,Colin Lamoureux,4,Family oriented provincial park on the banks of the Rideau with a nice Beach
Rideau River Provincial Park,Brian Sehl,2,The bathroom smells awful.  The beach is nearly non existent and I'm pretty sure mosquitoes were invented here.  Not worth the $14 entry fee
Rideau River Provincial Park,Yvonne Hughes,4,"It was nice, only down fall was other people coming and going who disregarded the max speed which was 20ks, my daughter whos 4 who ran ahead of me nearly got hit by an idiot going 40. We were right by the washrooms and showers and the beach was lovely. "
Rideau River Provincial Park,Krista St-Amour,3,"Parking is expensive, and to reserve a picnic spot is also very expensive. Washrooms are not checked during the day and are disgusting!!!"

Rideau River Provincial Park,Jes Turn,4,Great spot! Just out of the city it was close but far enough to get away for a night or two!

Rideau River Provincial Park,Mikey Noynay,3,"It was just an okay campsite. The grounds were uneven and when it rained there was a collection of puddles.
