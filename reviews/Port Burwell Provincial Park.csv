Port Burwell Provincial Park,K C,5,"Absolutely my favorite place to go for either a day trip to the beach, or camping at the park. Beach is all sand, and you can walk out forever with amazing natural sandbanks here and there. There's also a dog beach with tons of space for ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Devon Posthumus,4,"Love camping here. Lots of activities for the kids and the playground is great too. Clean washrooms/showers.

My only complaint is the beach is a little hike from the parking lot and the boardwalk seems short. But I understand that they don't want to ruin the natural areas."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Ryan P,5,"Great park.
Spacious sites.
Lots of vegetation between sites for excellent privacy.
Large, well groomed beach.
Water is only a few feet deep for about a kilometer out from shore. 
Great for young kids.
Book early in season since sites go quickly."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jeff Neven,5,"I love this park! The beach is great. We were there on a long weekend and still had lots of space for beach volleyball and kite flying. The campsites are big and private. The washrooms/showers are new and clean. 
The town is a sleepy ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Liz Cowie,5,So beautiful here.  We stayed 1 week on a ravine site. One of the unreservable sites. We were lucky to get it on the last week before school. Truly the nicest sites there. Washrooms facilities were exceptionally clean and lots of showers ...
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Aamir Bhaijiwala,5,"Good sandy beach. Waves in the water which makes it fun. Dog friendly with a dedicated dog off leash area. 
Less crowded than some of the other beaches I have been to.
One downside is that the walk from parking lot to beach is a little longer than some other places."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,David & Jillian Vandermeersch,5,"Great spot for camping or a beach trip. Well maintained. Close enough to local amenities should you need something. Rates seem a bit high, but considering the maintenance and service provided the price is justified."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Vivien Hartshorn,4,Great sites. Nice walks. Good bathroom shower and laundry facilities. You need very long hydro cables to connect to power source. Beach awesome but either a long walk or a short car ride.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Mathew Castillo,5,I thought it was a great public  nude beach.   $15 for entry clothing was in use on beach markers 1-5 but park in lot 5 and walk apx 500 yards past lot 6 and there is the nude beach.   Every type no need to be embarrassed because nobody ...
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Brenton Mcanuff,3,"Sites are beautiful, though staff is very strict and mostly teenagers on power trips or have no authority at all.  Use the eastern public beach as it is groomed, free and there's a French fry shack.  Also bring cash as the ice cream shop at the top of the hill doesn't take credit card.  Otherwise great fun."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Nikolai Ustiantcev,4,"Large beach, rather clean, separate area for dogs, spacious parking. Washrooms leave to wish better."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jason Fournier,5,"Great spot, our first time visiting.  Nice mix of site types, and lots of space to explore.  Plenty of bathrooms, a very nice park for the kids and a huge field with badminton (and volleyball?) nets as well.

You are immediately greeted ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Andy L.,4,We had a great time catching into the big wave. The beach is shadow and is for the kids.  The only disappointment was the colour of the sand beneath the water.  It is black and brown and stained our swimming wear.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Carlos Burgos,5,Awesome place to relax in a small town. Been here a few times and its surprisingly a pleasant enviroment to be in.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Beth Hardy,5,We came to stay for 1 night and ended up spending a whole week. A beautiful campground the sites have plenty of shade and are big. They have enough trees that you are fairly secluded from your neighbour which gives plenty of privacy. We ...
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jeff W,5,"Great dog beach. Sandy and shallow. Warm water, I highly recommend going. First time there, but will definitely be back"
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Mike Cooper,5,"This is a great place with very good public and provincial park beaches.  There are short but nice hiking trails, a good playground for kids and good facilities.  The nearby town of Port Burwell is small but very nice too and boasts a retired military submarine on display and open for tours."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jackie McIsaac,3,Usually love this beach! Been here countless Times! Went today and had to pay by putting $ in a dropbox as it is late in the season. After depositing our $14.50 we found as we entered the beach area it was unbearable! We were swarmed by ...
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Marlene Koehler,3,"Well maintained & clean.generous sites in iroquois campground. Lovely walking trail. Spectacular beach. Sadly, swimming was not recommended when we were here. Helpful staff."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Darryl Horrocks,5,"As a first time camper I must say this park is very clean, we'll laid out with sites that include electrical hook ups, and privacy.  My family really enjoyed our stay and recommend it."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Will Nut,5,"Well maintained, in a lovely small-town area on Lake Erie, large dog beach. Not over crowded even on busy weekends"
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Katrina Norton,5,Lovely colours in the fall. Walk at own risk but lovely to have the park to yourself
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Andrew Cruickshank,4,"Great beach area with nice sand and plenty of parking.  Much less busy than the free beach just next door in town. Trails to the beach from the camping areas exist, but you have to look carefully to see the signs for them."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,R Oakley,5,We weren't exactly at the park but we did enjoy the beach just a few minutes down the road. P1 is the dog beach and I believe 2-5 is the other areas you may enjoy (just not with dogs). Very clean and lots of sticks to throw if you decide ...
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Bob Mckeown,4,"Large sites,   sandy beach, clean washrooms and great cycling through some of the best farm land in Ontario. This park has lots to offer"
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jackie Taylor,5,"The provincial park beach is amazing.
If you go to the last parking lot it is less busy and is away from the dog beach.
The beach is monitored by park rangers so it is a family friendly safe environment"
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Suzanne Patry,5,Great place for us big women ...u can feel good in your skin....no fee parking ..family oriented.  2volley ball courts..

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Amanda Smith,5,Very well maintained campsites and facilities.  Friendly staff. Great kids playground and field.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Frederick Oliver,4,Beautiful park but somewhat long walk to the beach. Go early or late as the midday sun is too hot for dogs paws to access the beach. Ice cream shop at dog beach
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jim Di Crescenzo,4,Great provincial park.  Each site seemed to be secluded and easy to make private.   Beech was awesome and good sand bars for my young kids.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jake Janzen,2,When you charge 14.50 for a one day pass. I can see why everyone wants to go to the free beach. This place has no picnic tables on the beach.the main public beach has lots. Bathrooms are limited and a long walk from the beach. No i would not return.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Chadwick Buckle,5,strongly recommend large buffer zones between most sites for more private experience. bathrooms are newer and adequately attentend to
Port Burwell Provincial Park,John Stefani,4,Stayed in Leander section on the Civic holiday long weekend. Most sites were occupied by families with many children running around. But they were all well-behaved and there was no public drunkenness on the part of the adults. All this ...
Port Burwell Provincial Park,P Thompson,1,"Extremely disappointing.  In a sentence, if you are looking for an outdoor actual camping experience, don't stay here.  Its right beside the town and you can see houses/cottages from the sites, we heard sirens and fire trucks several ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jay Denson,2,"It’s great if you’re looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of bigger beaches in the area like Grand Bend, but it comes at a cost. It’s isolated so good options are limited. There are no food choices in the immediate area other ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Joel Knight,5,"Campsites are always spacious, nice and well groomed. Bathrooms are kept spotless, and the staff is always helpful. Beach is great, even though the walk is long."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Mike Munro,4,"The beach used to be a lot better when it was maintained.  It has now become overgrown in many areas in what is called ""returning to a natural state."""
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Jonathan Lees,5,"This park is crazy. I've never seen more private sites in a Provincial Park.  There's a mix of relatively open sites, but there are just so, so many absolutely private spots.  The foliage is so dense!

The beach is perfectly maintained ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Kimberly Shaw,4,Amazing spot with fantastic dog beach.  Can be busy in high season but worth exploring.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Marcia Adams,4,"The site was lovely except for the picnic table which was long past its due date...I know it's not full season yet....but the spped limit around the park is not enforced enough..
We've stayed there for a few years now and can highly recommend it...."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,jessica harding-hill,4,"Quiet beach, amazing water .... I like the fact it gets deep so you can actually swim."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Omar Elbakary,5,"Nice, quite, isolated place. Good for family RV trips"

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Lynda O'Meara,4,"Large campsites but be prepared if your site is shadey. For any folks afraid if spiders there is an excessive amount of daddy long legs.  I would have preferred mosquitos since you just need off for them.   

Washrooms are maintained ..."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Bonnie Boyko,5,Other then the long walk from parking to the Optional Beach..Its Awesome !!  Clean beach & a good time 😎

Port Burwell Provincial Park,James de Boer,5,"Great sites, amazing beach. One of the best provincial parks in SW Ontario."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,James O'Hearn,5,"Wonderful park
Keep it clean please."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Wiĺliam MacKenzie,2,Awful service and pricing. Another case of Ontario gouging the public. Their website is always wrong and very misleading. Will think twice about going to any Ontario provincial park again. Brutal!!!! The only positive for this park is the off leash area of the beach
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Meshach Jonathan,1,Only one car per campsite. This sucks especially if you have a large family or are a part of bigger groups.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Dan Doxtator,4,Beautiful place to go for weekend camping or day visit
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Kaylee butler,5,Very small campground su it  is quite. Only issue is that the beach is in a different area. You have to drive out of the campground and down the road to get to the beach.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,tyler lisk,4,Good camping area with decent shaded camp sites.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,gloria shortt,3,Came into a camp site with no grass and surŕounded by trees which blocked out the sun and the site was very dirty bc of fallen debrief from the trees.  it had rained b4 we arrived and was very muddy for entirely time were this site.  The ...

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Karyn Noble,4,We had a great experience..love the Beach
Port Burwell Provincial Park,John Zanin,2,"Not much to see.... Pt Burwell seems to be a town without much going for it. Lots of closed shops in the downtown. The beach is a 'Blue Flag' beach, so at least they take their beach appearance seriously."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Ricardo Matos,5,It's a great place to go there's a lot of fun stuff to see and do.
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Anna Soliman,5,"The sites seemed to have good privacy and were a good size, and the washroom facilities seemed taken care of and clean. Would book here again :)"

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Mike V,5,"Visited the nude beach, nice place"
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Gary Lazurek,5,I liked my first visit to the nudist beach but the mosquitoes were terrible. The beach needs a good clean-up. Way too many much branches and old driftwood could cut your feet. People were friendly the staff was too!
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Lola Fornos,4,Best park that I have been. Very big sites. Awesome staff! Bathroom is clean all the time. Beach is great but windy. It would be great to have direct access to the  beach from the camping.  
Port Burwell Provincial Park,tim sywyk,5,Quiet peaceful large Beach that one could get lost on if they wished beautiful sunsets clean water
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Grant C,5,We've been to this park a number of times on a day pass. We absolutely love the area at the end of the park for its clothing optional ambience.  Spend an hour or two and enjoy the free feeling of letting it all hang out. The beach here ...

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Holly Mathers,4,Been camping here most of my life and now bring my kids too.  The new comfort stations are a huge improvement over the course of my life and the small town of Port Burwell has lots of things to see and do with kids.  Fishing is decent ...

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Daniel Prinsen,3,"The sites varied regarding privacy, shade, and size but overall were fine. The beach for the park is so overgrown with tons of branches in the sand. I believe this is due to a new motion to let the beaches go naturally. As an alternative, there is a city beach not far from the park which is clean/cleared."
Port Burwell Provincial Park,Josh Allan,4,Very well run campsite. Modern amenities such as shower and bathroom were much more than adequate and within walking distance of our campsite. The site itself was a good size. Not a lot of forest though.

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Ian-Karen Warner,3,A huge park with many sites. We stayed on 96. Pretty good privacy between sites. A nice trail to beach but really far! The beach is one of the better sand beaches but is about a half hour walk from the campground. Bring bikes!

Port Burwell Provincial Park,Dave Parkes,4,Had a great start to the camping season at this gem of the Ontario Parks system. 4/5 only because the water in the showers was ice cold (start-of-season glitch?).
