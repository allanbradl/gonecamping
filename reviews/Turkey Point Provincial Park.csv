Turkey Point Provincial Park,Justin Majik,3,Spent a weekend here in 2018. It's a nice park but has a touristy feel to it. It's definitely a park where people go to party as it's so close to the main strip. I'd stay here again for a quick weekend but nothing more as we like the up north experience.
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Andrew Kim,3,"The campsite was very spacious, well maintained and moderately private. We were able to see many fireflies at night. Other than the beach which was quite distant outside the park, I didn’t find many attractions or activities within the ..."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Mathew Daniels,4,Beautiful park with large sites. Close to a big beach on Lake Erie and wonderful winery's. There are local produce growers and during the summer there is a plethora of fresh things to eat.
Turkey Point Provincial Park,John Bakker,4,"Turkey Point Provincial Park and village are quaint and small village stretched along the Ontario north shore of Lake Erie one and a half hours west of Hamilton.
Great soft sandy beach, a number of restaurants and eateries and boat ..."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Jonathan Lees,4,"Turkey Point is a really fun provincial park.  The sites were well maintained and the amenities were very good.

The beach was a bit of a distance from the park itself, and you had to go into town to get to it... which, if you're ..."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Brian Kimbel,5,"Great place to mountain bike. Good variety of trails. Well marked, maps in the park. Some hills, some flats."

Turkey Point Provincial Park,Keith Pritchard,4,"Another fantastic Provincial Park. 
Well maintained and kept clean.

Turkey Point Provincial Park,robert dietrich,5,"This is a beautifull park with beaches, camping, entertainment and sandbar on the beach for good eats.
The water gets organic in high heat periods, but it's clean.
Right on the inner longpoint bay, makes it great for boating.
Highly recommend trying this one."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Sonya Richmond,5,A great park and wonderful forest to stroll around in
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Nathan Arsenault,5,Great beach... shallow waters... good place to go not much shade
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Linda Clemow,2,Was disappointed when we found out the park wasn't on Lake Erie. No beach without a car. The comfort stations are lacking in cleanliness and need updating. I refused to use the showers. The sites were just okay. Lots of ants in the area.
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Amanda Manship-Knight,3,"Park was incredibly loud until 2:30 or 3 am both nights we stayed--sleep was impossible. Additionally, the other family we camped with had a site much smaller and much less private than ours but was only $10 less - a larger price difference would have been more realistic for the lack of quality comparison."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Shannon Best,5,Such a beautiful place to take your kids. Not overly crowded like most parks and visitors take care in cleaning up. Keeping it beautiful
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Elnaz Moein,5,"It is very nice cottage country, love the scenery and all the beautiful cottages there. But this place is only good if you are going to be at a cottage or camping ground close to the beach otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it because ..."

Turkey Point Provincial Park,christine scott,5,"We came here 19 years ago for our honeymoon with our kids and loved it. We decided a couple days ago to sneak away and Turkey Point Provincial park had the perfect spot. Nice amount of privacy, great campfire and everyone out strolling ..."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,barb miller,3,"Like this park only for its proximity to the beach.sites are very open with no privacy.too much noise and allround sillyness.by younger patrons.should be patrolled better. I'm not a prude but when I camp, I like to enjoy where I am."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Holly Ferguson,5,"Park is always clean. The beach is great. Much better than dover.  Have been camping here for 24 years. The staff is always friendly. Sometimes on the weekends it can be a little noisey, but nothing out of hand. The beach can sometimes ..."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Zach Shaw,4,"Nice campground.  Wish the beach was closer to the campground though, it's beautiful.  Also, playground didn't really have much for toddlers.  Small other complaint, there really weren't any clearings close by to watch the stars."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Austin Hung,4,"Washroomsamong the cleanest seen at a provincial park. Group campsite was good. Nearby beach was not walking distance, and the vehicle lineup to get through the single entry point was very long at peak hours."

Turkey Point Provincial Park,Bruce Pritchard,4,Great camping nice and clean but the water is too far away.
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Jaca D,2,"The beach is somewhat dirty and there are way too many boats and scooters. The water was not very clear. Also, although very long, the beach is not wide so it easily gets crowded on a hot day. Good thing about it is that it has a lot of natural shade."

It's my new go to beach

Turkey Point Provincial Park,David Scott,4,It's about what you expect from a Provincial Park on the lake. I thought that was a little pricey but it's a popular place. Play sand on the beach a few twigs but again it's on the lake it's expected
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Chey Alexis,5,Nice little area
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Ryan Clelland,1,The place is absolutely filled with poison ivy and the bathrooms are horrific. We camp all over Ontario and this is by far the worst campground I have ever been to. The bathrooms are worse then most port-a-potties I've seen. There is no ...
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Panthster,2,This is not really a good place to camp considering there are other places. I got an ear infection from the water there where people swim. There are also lots of poison ivy there so it is dangerous for kids. My friend got a tick bite ...
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Neesha R,3,"It's a nice beach but small so it can get crowded on hot days, the sand has alot of twigs and leaves as does the water's edge but once u go past the edge where its dirty the water isnt as bad. Lots of boats on the area and jet skis. The local stores beachside are a bit overpriced. Ok for a short visit."
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Nathan Stentaford,5,Good beach - shallow so expect marine matter in the water but otherwise nice
Turkey Point Provincial Park,DELTA NYNE,1,The beach was more of an ashtray 🤮. Not sure what was worse the thousands of cigarette butts or the overcrowding. Personally I enjoy a clean and more spacious beach day

Turkey Point Provincial Park,Andriy Shcherbatyuk,3,"This is one of the good old parks.

Not sure about food or drinks as i did not go into the shops.

Turkey Point Provincial Park,kelly stone,5,great place
Turkey Point Provincial Park,R Dinu,2,Washroom facilities are deplorable. Probably 20 years old and very very very dirty. For $50 / night one would expect something better. The was the only downside to this park which is otherwise beautiful and within close proximity to a great beach and sanctioned off road dirt bike trails. 
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Yury Goldaev,2,"It was so overcrowded that it didn't look like camping. Camping sites are so close to each other that I would probably had more privacy if I set up a tent in my backyard. A beach isn't in a walking distance, you actually have to drive ..."

Turkey Point Provincial Park,Brandon O'Regan,4,T.P BABY
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Bob Beaulieu,1,Worst Provincial Park. Office closes at 4PM. Closed another full day. Horrible noisey drunken family with teens partied till midnight before Rangers did anything. Never coming back.
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Gwen Darling,3,Hate that I have to pay for parking. It would make more sense to have better retail stores the city could collect taxes from. There are certainly enough tourists who would willingly spend while there and keep the economy turning instead of being irritated about the price of parking.

Turkey Point Provincial Park,Bill Dimitroff,5,One of my favorite beaches in Ontario.
Turkey Point Provincial Park,Derek Bouwman,3,"Have been to many provincial parks...Turkey point has beautiful large sites surrounded by mature Trees.   Didn't have any trouble with poison ivy or ticks...just wear shoes and stay out of the bushes.
