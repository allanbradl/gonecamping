Halfway Lake Provincial Park,Colleen H,5,The beaches are amazing!! Sand clean and great shallow water depth throughout the swimming area. Park stores are always full of necessities and wonderful trinkets. The park here is old fashioned but entertaining none the less. Parks staff are very welcoming and helpful.
Halfway Lake Provincial Park,Kurt Snetsinger,5,Great park for families. Sites are spaced out enough that you aren't sitting on top of your neighbor. Large and clean public beach.  Dog friendly but remember to bring a long lead since dogs are to remain leashed.
Halfway Lake Provincial Park,Al Linton,4,We always like to come back to Halfway Lake Provincial Park. A lot of memories for us. It is away from the city with lots of area and trails to roam. Beautiful setting on the lake and good fishing.
Halfway Lake Provincial Park,Dhruv Patel,5,Very peaceful park. Beach is nice enough to hangout on hot sunny day. Staff was kind and helpful. Few site does have waterfront. We had one of these and had lots of fun in our inflatable boat all day long. Site num 93 is highly preferred.

Halfway Lake Provincial Park,Laurie LaFleche,4,Great park but unfortunately could not take advantage of all the park had to offer due to complete fire ban which closed the hiking trails. Maybe next time.
