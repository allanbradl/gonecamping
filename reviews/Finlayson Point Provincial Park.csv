Finlayson Point Provincial Park,Karly Perreault,5,"Very clean park with well maintained grounds, friendly staff and great fishing!! The docks could use a bit of work but other than that this place is excellent. I come here every year and am never disappointed."

Finlayson Point Provincial Park,James O'Hearn,5,Nice surprise. Park has many dimensions from shoreline sites to rugged natural Canadian Shield sites. Staff have been very helpful and friendly. Haven't checked out any trails yet but that's next.
Finlayson Point Provincial Park,Paul Cote,2,Not overly impressed. Bathrooms were clean but the rest of the park needs some TLC. The rangers were driving around our area continually...annoying...the wood I was forced to buy was hardwood and we were even allowed to clean up some dried branches from the side of the road to get the fire started.

Finlayson Point Provincial Park,Richard Vicentino,2,"One of the worst parks I've been to. The ""beach"" is all but non existent and the sites are small. One comfort station for the entire park. It's only saving grace is that if you want to access lake tamagami this is a good way to do ..."
