Mississagi Provincial Park,Jade Alexis,3,"Wish that half stars were an option as I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars!

Mississagi Provincial Park,Keith Charabaruk,5,"This place has become an annual tradition for us.  We have been going up for over a decade and now all my family is involved.

Park staff is friendly, clean lakes, great fishing and a lack of cell service is amazing.  There are few places left that you can truly unplug."
Mississagi Provincial Park,Michele Blundell,1,Paid 12.00 $ day pass to use the provincial park beach. Drove an hour and half to get there. We had our granddaughters for a week and thought it would be a great beach day. Well. The beach is full of leaches. Nobody there not one person. ...
Mississagi Provincial Park,AL KRC,5,"Worth the drive!  Love this place (other than the deer flies, mosquitoes and black flies).   Itâ€™s peaceful and not many motor boats around. They rent out bikes and canoes.  I wish they rent out kayaks or SUP however.   There are a few hiking trails.  Washrooms are primitive."
