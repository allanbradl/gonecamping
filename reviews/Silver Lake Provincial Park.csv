Silver Lake Provincial Park,Firelight Studio,4,"This park is good, lots of swamp and wetland to explore, saw lots of wetland wildlife in my 3 day stay.  Excellent sandy beach and lake access with canoe kayak rental available.  It’s a small park so there a little bit of everything and ..."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Patrick Vigneault,5,Nice camping for the whole family. Beaches are kept very clean. We enjoyed fishing/kayaking on the lake. Kids catched half a dozen frogs within our first hour on the ground !
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Dujana,3,Great small provincial park. Campsites on the lake are spacious and have good privacy. Not alot of big size fish. Its great for beginner camping the only down side its near a highway. Washroom and showers are clean. Park has canoing and great views.
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Irvin Lapierre,4,Good camping experience for the family. Beach and boardwalk trail through the woods. Only downside is sites are close to each other so you may hear your neighbor.
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Joseph Luciano,5,"Nice provincial park.  Small park with some small sites, however, there are some sites that are fair size for sure.  Beach is clear water and free of seaweed.  Staff are friendly and efficient at keeping the park clean at all times. ..."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,myskijoring Healey,4,This campground is great for a day trip or to stay 3 or 4 nights. The perks are a nice beach and easy to launch kayaks on and not ever too busy. There is one trail that is maintained nicely for a short hike. The downfall of this park is ...
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Dhruv Patel,4,This park is very small but great to spend few days with family or friends. Lake is decent for paddling or boating. Beach is not great but good enough for hot days. We had site number 42 and it has lake facing view which was great part of my trip.
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Lidia Araujo,3,"We were there on the last weekend, the park is far for us but we decided to go and have fun, the first day a chick approached us saying we were being too loud, we were just talking with the family around campfire. I don’t understand if ..."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Philippe Tessier,5,"Very clean, well maintained. Good spot. Site are a good size and the ones closer to the river are quite private. Highway side might be a little louder and less private. Friendly wildlife."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Francis Hamilton,1,"The park ranger here is on a power trip    looking to hand out warnings and tickets 

We were a group of 16 25 year old we so I get the fact that they wpuld be all over is but

 I had the correct amount of camp sites and were not there ..."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Joy Baylon,1,This is the most horrible park I’ve ever been! The camp warden especially the girl was the most rude I’ve ever met! We’ll never go back on that park ever! Instead of giving us peaceful time we just experienced horrible time because of those warden! I recommend everyone not to go there ! You’ll regret it !!!
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Kannan Muthiah,4,"It is a very nice and quiet park by the Trans-Canada Highway. If you are travelling between Toronto and Ottawa, it is a nice stop-over.
There is a kid's play area, canoe rentals, fishing area, kids swim area, boating area, camping area, picnic shelter."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Ioan Nicorescu,4,"Great location. Great camping site. Good facilities. You can rent kayaks, canoes. However if your camping site is too close to the highway the noise could be a little  too much at night."

Lots of privacy, clean park, well maintained and monitored grounds, well maintained beach. 

***Do your diligence with regards to weather***

 if you can avoid rain and overcast you'll be ok. The bugs were ..."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Andrew Carew,4,Great spot to spend an afternoon in the lake or camp.  Sites are some what close together and can be close to the highway.  Would be smart to view your site before paying.
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Adonis Dina,3,"Night 1

This camp sucks. Caterpillars everywhere. Warden is on a high horse - stalked our campsite in the dark, and gave us a warning (stern threat) for talking around the camp fire (I am not making this up!). Warned us that his next ..."
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Ian Taylor,5,Made a quick stop to visit to an old friendly Campground. Determine if we were driving a large motorhome probably not a good place to stop as most of the spots are four smaller tent trailers or tents
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Nathalie Cote,4,"Great camping site! Super clean and organized! Beach is clean, sand is soft and well maintained! Only downside is the noise from highway 7 at night! The trucks are really loud!"
Silver Lake Provincial Park,Jim Abernathy,1,"Beautiful camp ground, lake and beach. However the wardens are rude and harass you as soon as the night comes around. If you plan on being super quiet this is the place for you, if you want to play music(even at a level so low you can`t ..."

Silver Lake Provincial Park,Rebecca Klapwyk,5,Very nice shallow beach for kids. After Sept 10 the gate is closed and it is a bit of a walk in to the beach with kids plus beach gear but it is so worth it. The walk in enterance is not wide enough for a large stroller. Early on a ...

Silver Lake Provincial Park,Don Crawford,5,I will gave it a 10
