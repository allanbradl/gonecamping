Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Sulanis,4,"It is the second time at this restaurant and it was just as good as the first. Decent prices, great staff in person. Over the phone the girl was rude, but it's a minor thing."
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Ryan McCarron,3,The food was pretentious without being anything more than ok.  Old fashioned and boring.  The lakes and mountains however were spectacular.
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Deutschin boyadtschiev,4,"People wonder where is the source of water.

Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Cara R-N,5,Neat spot - beautiful views. Great place to visit. I'm certain to return for a stay.
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Tin Leung,3,Quaint little lake . Not much going on unfortunately. More regrettably it seemed a bit run down. What would have been a superb view of the bay was pretty much blocked by the overgrown shrubbery in front of the fencing.
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Milena Prince,5,The sunset is magnificent. Panoramic views well worth the drive. Will be back here again sometime for sure.
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Zachary Leger,5,A beautifully unique spot.
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Carbon Lilies,5,"On one side of the road you have a lake that formed on top of a ""mountain"". Clear, undisturbed, serene with plaques describing its formation. On the other side of the road is a magnificent view out over the Reach where you can watch the ferry take its load from on side to the other. Especially beautiful in the fall."
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Martin Crawford,4,"Awesome for a latte, stunning view on an elegant patio overlooking the ferry route far below.  Charcuterie plate was small but high quality.

Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Wendy Chesson,3,Loved the lake and the view but the restaurant on the same side of the street as the lake was over priced and two of us out of the four did not like their meals. Very limited menu.

Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Maria Azzari,5,So pretty
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Jon Yazer,1,"It's a lake that happens to be on a mountain near another body of water. If you've seen a lake before, prepare to be disappointed.

Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Darryl Denike,5,Beautiful little park.  Lots of history.

Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Jason Gee,5,Beautiful view.
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Monika Mazur,4,Great views!
Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Andy Zarzycki,4,"The cool thing is that there's a lake, on a mountain top, with no apparent source feeding it. If you stand at the roadway you can see the elevated lake, and much further below the bay that's at Lake Ontario level. Limited facilities (washrooms seasonal)."

Lake on the Mountain Provincial Park,Robert Cox,3,Not much to do unless you have a kayak to explore the lake. No walks.
