Mara Provincial Park,Dujana,4,Great park for beginner camping. Have medium size picnic areas. Some spots can be muddy. Good showers and washroom.
Mara Provincial Park,W G,4,"Found this spot after doing a google search knowing I would be in the Orillia area. It’s a great spot if you are just looking for a nice quiet beach, some hiking trails or a campground.  There is ample parking. The beach itself is large ..."
Mara Provincial Park,Aucoin Digital,5,I stayed at Mara Provincial Park last weekend. We were at a campsite near the end of the park that does a loop. We had 2 secluded campsites for 8 people. Park Wardens were friendly. The beach is huge and busy during the weekends. Would recommend  10/10.
Mara Provincial Park,indu rana,5,Had a fantastic day at the beach. Loved everything about it. The temp was like 30° but didn't even feel it because of the trees n shade around.
Mara Provincial Park,Karen Misek,5,Small park with approximately 100 sites. Our site wasn't very private but during the week it wasn't too busy. Beautiful beach within walking distance.
Mara Provincial Park,whoizaghost,5,Loved it. But I wish they had a sign on how much entrance cost.like q small sign maybe put the cost up front it was 14 dollars and to pay in cash after a certain time for a day pass. But otherwise well worth the price for sure loved it hope they maintain it this way..

Mara Provincial Park,Kevin Pike,5,"Wonderful little gem of a park!  We used it as an introduction to camping spot for our young kids since it wasn't that far from home.  If things went south quick it wouldn't be much to pack and go home.  Arrived in a downpour, but that ..."

Mara Provincial Park,James Weber,5,I frequently visit Mara to camp during the summer and I love it! The park is fairly small which I enjoy as there is not much noise. The beach is very big as well. There is also a considerable amount of mosquito so don’t forget bug spray!
Mara Provincial Park,Melissa Shah,5,"This is by far the best beach we have been to just outside the GTA. There is lots of space on the beach to set up your beach tents, mats etc, there's a grassy lawn with picnic tables, a small playground area with some slides and fun ..."
Mara Provincial Park,Shazia Raja,5,It is a really nice park and the beach with lots of trees and a lot of space for kids to play sometimes in summer hot months they have a ban on open fires so if you are planning to have a charcoal BBQ make sure you call ahead and ask them if the ban is in effect you can still use your propane BBQ but not the charcoal one.
