Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,gonzozen55,3,"This is a great Provincial Park for camping, but not having actual Comfort stations is a real minus for this park. They charged enough for the sites that they should be able to spend some money and make this even better. This is a very ..."
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Barb Gudgeon,5,"Gorgeous small park.  Lovely scenery.  I was here as a child, 58 years ago.  It sure has changed...but then again  so have I."
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Paul Dalton,5,"Lovely, quiet park. The lack of comfort station is made up by the friendliness of the park wardens. Love going back there time after time."

Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Marjorie Hurst,2,This park is good id you have a tent or small camper ... We have a large trailer and it was very difficult to manoever to water fill up and dumping -- you cannot pass on the roads at all and there are a lot of large tree branches over ...
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,uJennifer Reid,2,Not my favorite campground at all. The beach is to small for the qty of people that camp there. They only have outhouses. There is only 2 showers for the whole park and you have to actually drive there. No hiking trails at all in the ...

Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Tanya Borojevic,4,"I had a semi-relaxing weekend. The first night when we arrived there were a bunch of teenagers that were a bit loud but i guess that's expected to some degree. Other than that it was nice.

The park is small but plenty to explore if you ..."

Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Todd Kanhai,3,There was blue green algae when we were there. Spots we were in were almost flooded. Marina was very close by. Still all in all it was nice.
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Dorothy Dalton,2,"Nice and quiet enough place, a fisherman's dream. I wish there were no more than a handful of people visiting it at a time as there are only 2 showers. The park office was enlarged and renovated but the showers stayed same old. "
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Colin Branston,5,"Gorgeous camp ground, close quarters camping. On a busy weekend may feel cramped depending on other campers. We did not have this feeling whatsoever. Booked one of the campsites right on the edge of the bay. Easy to avoid bears if garbage is taken care of before bedtime. Helpful staff. Rental canoes are available."
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Casey Park,5,"Really nice camp ground, especially for fishers. Very friendly wardens and camp staff."
Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park,Kawartha Lakes Media,2,"During our 2015 visit, we found that this is a very tiny park, with tight turns and very little privacy. The dump station for RV's is elevated too high, and although we did not find this to be an issue, those with smaller RV's or lower ..."
