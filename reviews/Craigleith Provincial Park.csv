Craigleith Provincial Park,David Stade,5,What an amazing park. Don't know where to start staff was awesome. Bathrooms where so clean. Loved the swimming. The other campers where so friendly.  Definitely going back next season.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Brian Suggs,3,"The best part about the park is access to the lake. It's beautiful and shallow. Lovely place for families. We were camping close to the highway and it was loud. If you can't get a spot right on the lake, don't go. Those spots are quieter."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Crystal MacEachern,3,"I give the camp ground a 5, it's very nice.  Right on the water and beautiful.  Clean showers and baths. Sites are smaller than I expected but there is so much waterfront to explore it didn't matter to us. Went with my 2 kids. Had a site ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,It's Rin.,5,My friends and I stayed 5 days here this past week and we loved it. Even though we were right by the highway we found it easy to tune out any noise coming from it. The beach was beautiful and we were able to watch some beautiful sunsets. ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Heather Wilson,4,Our site is right on the water. Amazing sound of the waves. Not a lot of privacy which we semi fixed with the set up of our trailer and truck. We are right in the middle of where the facilities are so we have the longest walk to the washrooms. Site 196.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Adnan Riaz,5,"Nice spot for 1 or 2 days camping. Access to water is there but a regular beach is under 3 min drive away. 
Sunrise and sunset was amazing to watch if the day is clear."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Jean McLachlin,5,"Don't expect a private campsite - this is not a wilderness park. Go for the waterfront. It's beautiful slate rock shelves stretching out into Georgian Bay. If you love being on or in the water, there's nothing better than this park."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Chris Lyons,4,Great park to visit. Seems smaller than it is. Lots of beautiful shoreline to explore and beautiful sunrise and sunsets! Staff are friendly and courteous. Amenities are reasonably close by. Not all sites have much privacy though.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Lizaveta Ksenafontava,5,"Clean but pretty small. We came around 11 pm, so nobody wasn't here to sell some firewood, but it was bunch of bags left on the corner. We took one and paid in the morning. Thankful for that!"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Frank,5,Very nice campground.   Large pull through sites.  Staff very friendly.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Megan Vail,2,"Definitely not a campground for an extended vacation, more suited to someone just stopping in for a night on route to somewhere else. The park is very small, the sites are tiny and although we thought our site in Area C was lacking in ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Angie Burnett,5,We had an excellent stay! Site #12 was perfect for us with a lovely water view. We'll definitely be back! Thank you!
Craigleith Provincial Park,Hussein Hamam,4,"Went camping over the weekend. The camp site, especially the washrooms and showers, are clean and well maintained. The camp sites are close to each other and the privacy is minimal. No sand beach and the rocks make it hard to go inside the lake. Overall, it was a nice experience."
Craigleith Provincial Park,M Kellington,4,"This park is really small and its wedged literally between  the shore of Georgian Bay and Hwy 26.
Half the park has amazing tree sites the other half is almost treeless and some of the sites are ignorantly small.  
Still the views and seeming is amazing and kids can find fossilized bones very easily."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Shiva Teja,5,"If you are at blue mountains or wasaga beach, you must visit this place. I visited this place twice and loved to visit again and again. Best place for yoga too 😂"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Ashley Hallett,1,"Beautiful view, staff were very accommodating and friendly. But the campsites are so small and close together our trailer barely fit on it. We pulled in and back out again and headed home. Very unfortunate."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Tim Hill,5,"Great park! Camping is close to the road, but nice facilities. Beach is nice to cool off."
Craigleith Provincial Park,laura m,4,"The sound of the water at night was beautiful. Bring water shoes! There's oddly alot of roads here, we heard alot of traffic. The place could use more trees as well. Love how close it is to other fun things like the scenic caves"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Toya Marcano,5,Small camping site with big views and even friendlier people. This was our second time going to craigleith and this time my boyfriend and I just went by ourselves for an overnight trip. Site staff were very friendly when we had a concern ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Miranda Hall,4,Very beautiful camp ground! There isn't really a large beach and some trees are still small so not a lot of privacy between camp sites! Just a short 10 min drive to blue mountain village!
Craigleith Provincial Park,Brent H,4,Nice small park but close to a busy road
Craigleith Provincial Park,Merdod Zopyrus,3,We had a nice day trip here with family. Great view! Crystal clear water .. 3 stars due to the picnic tables placed right on the shoreline making the beach look very ugly!
Craigleith Provincial Park,S. Sangster,4,The views of Georgian Bay were hard to beat. Sunsets : take your breath away! The only downside was the description of our campsite. It was listed as full shade and this was inaccurate. Unless of course you consider 1 large Charlie Brown ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Rachel Hobden,5,"Amazing i would 100% come back here. Cute little beach, they have a shop on the campground that way if you forget small items they have them. Bathroom and showers are very clean which im happy to say. 
Not too far from any town for ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Wurd Industries,3,"Nice facilities, very clean. Lack of beach and very busy highway made our stay less enjoyable."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Francois Adam,1,A place to pitch a tent and sleep if all other campgrounds are booked solid. Then you may want to consider a motel or hotel.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Qchanels 14,4,Clean park with nicest swimming around. Water is super clean. Campground has a little noisy from highway traffic.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Manny Gamalinda,3,Sites close to the slate beach is excellent.   The rest of the spots are  a touch crowded and lacking in foliage. Showers are excellent.  Location is close to the local beach and town.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Chick Norris,1,Sadly.. my favourite place on the planet was ruined by a wind storm knocking over several trees!! 😪 but what was worse was how they let every site have like 15 tents on it and felt over run with people..  looked like a makeshift homeless community. 😪😪
Craigleith Provincial Park,Parth Doshi,1,Stayed there for 3 days. Make sure to put parking permit on the car display board. This park's parking lot is a cash cow for the town of wasaga beach police. They will make no. of visits to this parking lot every day. Camp sites are cramped. Park is ok.
Craigleith Provincial Park,John kelly,4,We camped on site 12 very close to the water. This helped to mask other bothersome noise. There isn't much coverage or foliage between many sites but the park does offer a nice playground and field for kids. There isn't a beach but lots ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Maggie White,3,Was a bit disappointed at the campground.  The sites are small and crowded. Not a good spot for swimming. Very close to the highway.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Dennis Gannon,5,Very nice park. Clean and quiet.  Highly recommend
Craigleith Provincial Park,Mike Bechely,1,"Terrible park.
No where to park truck and trailer to check in.
Controlled entrance which is a pain.
Sites are small and roads are narrow.
Site was very dirty.
Rude and ignorant people everywhere.
We had booked 2 nights and left after 1.
Will never ever return."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Lindsay Jackson,2,Beautiful location on Lake Huron. Unfortunately neighbors a highway. Not much privacy.
Craigleith Provincial Park,JUN LU,4,Nice small park to go camping and fossil hunting. $15 parking inside or outside flat rate.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Samuel Biehl,5,Really fun place to pay for day use and Wade around looking at fossils in the bracing beautiful waters.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Catherine Stephen,1,"The. Worst. Park. Ever.  Highway 26 traffic noise is ridiculous and offensive all the time except for about 3 in the morning.  You can SEE the vehicles on the highway, not just hear them.  Campsites?  What sites?  Reminiscent of a camp ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,john meechan,3,"Went to there shale beach;place was awesome,but we are trying to keep it a secret."
Craigleith Provincial Park,uJennifer Reid,3,I really liked that i could wake up take 20 steps and be in the water. I did not like that there is very little tree coverage and the highway is very close to the campground you can hear vehicles going by.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Bill wright,5,Favourite place for a swim. Very clear water.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Rob Grech,3,No real beach at this park but otherwise pretty good
Craigleith Provincial Park,Rob Farrell,3,Pretty waterfront and friendly campers. Unfriendly kids working in the office.  Don't bring a trailer longer than 24' here unless you like driving it in the bush.
Craigleith Provincial Park,patrick grenier,5,Lots to do and see in the area . Staff were very friendly and easy going . Lucky us the weather was great as well .
Craigleith Provincial Park,Lauren Nymann,3,"It was very small. Peaceful, but I probably won't be back, unless for a quick stop on my way to somewhere else."
Craigleith Provincial Park,SO M,5,"Love it, washrooms accesabale, drinking water taps available, direct acces to Lake, they run various nature programs."
Craigleith Provincial Park,L. Thompson,3,My boyfriend & i and our 2 dogs camped on site 20 which in our opinion was one of the nicest! It has a great view of georgian bay and its right across from the pet exercise area (smaller than what it looks like on the campsite map). The ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Alan Chan,3,"If you go here because its a Provincial Park, you will end up pretty upset. If you here to crash for a night, it's ok. There are no hiking / biking trails, no privacy, no water sport, right by hwy 26 which is very loud overnight. No bugs even in mid July. Showers are clean."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Frédérik Gagnon,5,"We stayed at the campground and i cannot recommend it enough for its beauty.  One has tp expect a little noise from the road, but it is drowned out by the waves if you take a camping spot next to the water."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Farid Barak,5,The best park with the cleanest water you'll find! Worth the 2 hour drive!!
Craigleith Provincial Park,Anti Godmother,4,It's cool to have a place with fossils so easily accessible.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Vaca Ancia,5,"Very beautiful site, water view and amazing sunsets, excellent customer service, clean and very well maintained. Will return to this campsite for sure."
Craigleith Provincial Park,my name is tyler and i am a youtuber,2,It waz really small and there was no privacy. And the place reeked of weed.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Greg Pierce,5,Great get away park.  Highway a little noisy but okay at night for sleeping
Craigleith Provincial Park,Alex Roy,3,No privacy anymore after the storm last year. Park wardens are also fairly strict as they usually are at Ontario parks. Good place to stay if you're looking to do downhill biking at Blue on a budget though. Would highly recommend for that. Quick 20 minute ride to the hill. 
Craigleith Provincial Park,Kent Ackland,5,N8ce park on the water. Some sites have direct water for trailer nice bonus
Craigleith Provincial Park,Ann-Marie Cowan,4,It was a beautiful campground.  Noisy though due to hwy 26
Craigleith Provincial Park,Peter Paek,5,What a cozy park
Craigleith Provincial Park,Lola Fornos,2,Good location but sites are very small. Views are awesome but it is very noisy since it is located besides the route.  I had reserved a waterfront site and when I arrived it was busy. The stuff was very nice and they tried their best but ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Mihai Bocsa,3,"Good campsites, good privacy but noisy either from the nearby highway or from the lake waves"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Arthur Weir,2,Entire campground is placed on a thin stretch of land between the shoreline and the highway.  Three to four rows of campsites with little intermediate brush make for very little privacy on the side of the camp which allows radios.  The ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Norm Albert,1,Worse provincial park i have ever seen. Lots are tiny and zero privacy.  Refused to stay.
Craigleith Provincial Park,steph hiltz,1,"The staff were friendly and the water in the facilities was hot, but the positives end there. The campsites are wide open (virtually no trees to separate sites for privacy), it's is very close to a main road with frequent traffic noise, ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,chad lloyd,2,"Ridiculously small sites. The highway noise is bothersome, especially at night when trucks go by"
Craigleith Provincial Park,tiya h,4,Its extremely near the water. The water was so clean that you can see your feet clearly and the flat rocks going in a row. Camping is possible here and has a small play ground also. Shower and washrooms and a store to buy firewood and ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Hannah Boeckman,5,I had a great time there ;P
Craigleith Provincial Park,Asharm A Abdul,4,"Nkce place, enjoyed my time there, clean place"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Sarah Farley,3,"This park maintains the same standards I have experienced at other provincial parks. The park is smaller then most, due to its location being between a major highways and Georgian Bay shoreline. The overall noise level of traffic is also ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Cole Thorsen,4,"The park is a thin slice on the shore of Georgian Bay, with a beautiful easily accessible flat shale rock coast. We found it a great spot to sit and watch the sunrise, but it would also be a great spot to launch a canoe or kayak."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Shawn Walton,4,"Great park right on Georgian Bay. Like, our camp site was like 10 meters from the shore with clear views of the water. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the park was clean, and sites were a good size. 

The sites weren't very ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Chris Kay,4,"Nice little park, too close to main road (highway)"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Jade Keatings,2,"My partner and I are huge provincial park fans and camp as often as we can, but Craigleith is hard to love. Easy to like, but it's definitely hard to love. 

While we had a beautiful site (155) right on the water, there is no privacy as ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Fred Simard,3,"We stopped by just to see how it is, well it is not for us. Too close to the road(highway), too close to your neighbor. But you are really close to the water."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Ryan Seeley,1,"Awful place to camp.  The grounds lack alot of trees so you literally can see the entire park, meaning there is zero site privacy.  It also is right along a main highway so it is super loud with trucks all night,  don't expect to sleep. ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Gil Strachan,3,"Visited 2 days after early spring opening, and with cool windy weather, we had some privacy.  Scored a parking spot down at the water, and the roar of the waves drowned out the noise of the highway traffic. The tree survival rate is ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Allan Lees,5,GREAT camping experience with wonderful staff.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Matt Simpson,2,No shade at campsite and lots of noise from nearby hwy 26.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Jackie Hyde,5,"Nice camping area, not a great beach very stones. The ranger was very helpful. Great area to be if you wish to experience the Colingwood area"
Craigleith Provincial Park,Robert S,3,"Windy and stoney  ground, the beach breeze was to strong to go boating.  Maybe just wrong timing as this was almost fall season."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Serge Louise - Erin Mills MS (1324),3,"We camp here for the location as it is fairly close to Wasaga Beach and Blue Mountain trails. It is not like the ""in town"" private camps, which I preferred when I was ""younger""
I generally prefer provincial parks because I know I will ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Al Chakaroun,2,"It is an Ok park if you do not want to travel far, the sites are small and no privacy. The beach...well I wouldn't call it a beach...too many rocks.."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Rob Brookfield,3,"Great location on the water. Park staff are excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Washrooms and showers are clean. Park is located on a busy highway so there is road noise, but most of the time during our stay the sound was muffled by ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Rachelle Widmann,2,I wouldn't want to camp there. The camp ground was very open. Not much foliage of any kind to separate the sites from one another. The sites were small and not well defined. We drove around the entire campground and this was the case ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Claire ___,2,2 stars for being right on Georgian Bay and staff were friendly. Loss of stars for the fact that the sites are extremely open (they do explain this on their website)and the washrooms and basic upkeep were less than OK. Good for a one night pit stop as well as to see the sunset on the bay.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Benjamin Munro,4,"Beautiful views from beach front campsites. Some sites seemed small, but ours (site 9) was perfect for our three tents (one large and two small). At times the highway is audible, but is generally overpowered by the relaxing waves."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Mark Brown,5,Not a lot of privacy but on the lake
Craigleith Provincial Park,Connor Goddard,5,"Excellent place! The rocks were very neat! Just be careful not to slip and fall while swimming, because the rocks tend to sometimes be rather slippery..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Joanne Lenos,4,"It's very close to Blue Mountain where we had an event to go to. That was the only reason we went there and probably the only reason we will go back to it again. Not the usual Provincial park feel. Sites are nice, but, too close to the road to my liking"
Craigleith Provincial Park,TV BOX,4,"If you don't mind to sleep with loud noise from Highway 26, or sounds of Georgian Bay,   it is still a good place to visit and camp."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Jennifer Luong,5,"Great spot to stop for a few hours. You can find tons of fossils in the shale and the rock ""tiers"" are a warm spot to sun yourself by the shoreline."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Mike Trotti,5,A small but beautiful park. It is especially nice during the fall season with the Georgian Bay waters providing a symphony of tranquility to go with the picturesque skies and scenery. One of my favourite parks.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Tony Sommerdyk,5,Camping by the water.   Very carefully maintained campground.   Great employees
Craigleith Provincial Park,sartaj aulakh,5,Peaceful and very well maintained
Craigleith Provincial Park,Al Jaim Pappu,3,not bad
Craigleith Provincial Park,Cannon Ball,2,Went to visit while we were staying at a 4 star RV site on the mountain West of Meaford. Well what can I say. There no way I could fit 59 feet in any of the spots. Sites to the north would be unreal water front if they would cut the ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Robert Tolton,5,"Great park. On the highway so you hear traffic, but quiet otherwise."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Nicole Vaillancourt,4,Lovely small park. The sites are small with minimal privacy. Staff are lovely. 
Craigleith Provincial Park,Zoltán Szatmáry-Bán,5,One of the best campsites I have been to. Pitch 5 is recommended.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Nidhi Dhara,5,Beautiful natural place
Craigleith Provincial Park,Bob Mckeown,5,Great park close to so many activities only downside is traffic noise
Craigleith Provincial Park,Erich Duff,2,"One of the worst provincial parks I've been to. And I'm a big fan of the provincial parks in general. It's narrow as hell, so you can't escape the noise of the highway that's RIGHT BESIDE IT. The campsites are way too close, with not ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Nancy Lalonde,4,Nice little park.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Simon Blain,5,Very nice camping. A bit noisy due to the proximity to provincial road 26. Bit the views of the Georgian Bay more than make up for it! 
Craigleith Provincial Park,Dorothy Dalton,2,"Busy, dusty, not much maintenance."
Craigleith Provincial Park,AK Hamdani,3,"nice park with clean bathrooms and showers. obviously the noise from the highway is there and loud when a truck passes, but we found that to be comforting because we are from the city lol. traveled with a 7 month old and she was able to ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Thomas SJ Kim,4,It has nice beach but camp ground is smaller than other provincial parks and privacy is worse than other parks. also  it is too close to local road and lots of noise from it.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Andrei Beznogov,3,"Good place for swimming for kinds and adults. 
It has ""flat rock"" shore which gradually goes to water without sudden deep holes. Water warms up very well and water is quite clear. 
Good for snorkeling and diving training.  
The bad thing, - it is next to highway 26. Noisy."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Amy Martin,4,A nice small park to take the kids and discover fossils embedded in shale.
Craigleith Provincial Park,krupesh faldu,5,"Great place for romantic getaway.
It's better if you visit during summer time.
Always best to have heater if going during cold season.
Try to get a place with electricity."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Rich Leed,1,"I'm not going to complain about the fact this location is right next to a busy highway.  But this is the worse camping site I've ever been.  

If you are going to this site for a day trip; that's fine.  Anything longer, find a hotel.

1. ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Eric Traclet,2,"The park has amazing lake access and is absolutely wonderful for swimmers. However, the park is located right next to a very busy highway and the noise is endless. The security guards wear bulletproof vests and patrol around like they ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,khurram Ibraheem,5,Awsome place for camping and picnic.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Jay White,3,"AMAZING VIEWS, but really tight quarters, you can here people talking in the next site as there is no privacy. "
Craigleith Provincial Park,Breanne Hodgson,4,We stayed here on the May long weekend. Park staff were great help and very friendly . Park is a small park but very nice. We stayed on a waterfront campsite it was a beautiful view however it was very very windy .. They do warn you ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,Matin Bozorg,5,Awesome campsite
Craigleith Provincial Park,Ernesto Pischello,5,We are just back from 2 nights camping. Beautiful place. Lots of fossils. The gentleman at the store/office was super and so all the stuff. very clean and well maintained sites. Ours had the lake view. 
Craigleith Provincial Park,Innerchanneltube,1,"Horrible experience.  The campsites are very close together and no privacy. Be prepared to be harassed by some of the park ""security"". Our group was 3 guys who stayed the weekend to go mtn biking. We were quiet and kept to ourselves. The ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Topaz Goold,4,"The crash of the water on the famous shale shore successfully drowned out the highway most of the night. The ground was hard - bring sleeping pads or foam is my advice. The campsite was a decent size, the store nearby was well stocked ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Americo,4,"Crowded, Too close to the highway.
 but the view is beatiful and the lake is right there."
Craigleith Provincial Park,rick james,1,Been camping 20 years and this park is worse than oastler provincial park ( which has a train running near it.) I did not end up staying here because there was absolutely no trees or brush to speak of in half the park (due to a storm in ...
Craigleith Provincial Park,let's play roblox,5,"Great facilities, helpful staff. And sooooo beautiful."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Beverley Brown,4,Great location (central). Nice clean park. Many of the sites are not very private. Great swimming.

Craigleith Provincial Park,Raymond Frizzell,2,"Beach area is great during day, but camping over night the road traffic is very loud."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Blair Collins,4,Close to the highway but overall a nice park. Close to activities at Blue Mountain.  The rocky shale beach and the playground kept my 10 year old son happy.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Colleen Taylor,5,Heaven on earth
Craigleith Provincial Park,John Shaw,4,"A fossil in every rock on the beach, great staff and nice spots on the water with 2 way hookups and open till the extreme of the season!  Go there most years.

Craigleith Provincial Park,Wassim Khalil,5,Amazing site
Craigleith Provincial Park,One Percent,1,"Park rangers are to sensitive about every little thing. We were talking at night, no music, no loud screaming, not using any tools, not making a noise, but they came up to us several times and told us to be quiet when we were TALKING and ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Alden Roth,4,"This was a nice campground with good facilities and awesome water access. Very beautiful there and had a wonderful night. Camp was a little expensive, but that was the only downside. "
Craigleith Provincial Park,Jessika Chanel,3,"A park is a park! Close to the highway, you can hear it all night, and my friend could even hear it on the beach, although the waves seemed to drown out the sound for me. The flat rock beach is pretty, but rocky and slippery, bring water ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Valerie Velano,5,"My family and i went for a whole week. Thats how amazing the Campground was. Although we did have our campsite near the highway we barely heard any noise, only during the day. If you are a deep sleeper then you won't be able to hear the ..."

Craigleith Provincial Park,Yummo Can,2,"Location is great and has the added plus of not being one of those tacky private sites in Wasaga which are basically open fields.  BUT, the sites have zero privacy.  Even the ones rated with average privacy have zero privacy.  At least ..."
Craigleith Provincial Park,Sanjeev Mehan,4,Wide sites.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Adammac123 Mac,1,Park staff are very rude the park ranger was queer ask me to leave cuz I wasn't registered meanwhile call me a cab Ace Cabs wouldn't take me home so they called the police Ace cabinets another company I will never ever do with again things have changed since Paul spensley sold it
Craigleith Provincial Park,Teymoor Siddique,5,Great place for camping and the beach is beautiful.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Chris Priester,1,"Wow! All I can say is wow. Ontario is covered with beautiful provincial parks. This is NOT one of them. I usually take Google reviews with a grain of salt. The negative ones were bang on. I'm shocked.

Craigleith Provincial Park,Christina Joyce,4,great camping on lake Huron not so good for little ones when lake is ruff but amazing for swimmers

Craigleith Provincial Park,Tyler Nowicki,5,From our camp site we could hear the waves crashing on the shore all night!
Craigleith Provincial Park,Hooman B,5,A very small park with cramped camp sites and only a single parking lot outside the park (you could still bring a single car inside). No trails or anything but beautiful beaches (not good for swimming) and very close to Blue Mountain.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Dhwani Jhala,2,Paid parking. Too costly.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Carol Crouse,2,"The worst camp grounds I've ever been to. The traffic is NON-STOP! It goes on all day & all night. Not even a rainfall drowns out the sound of it. Just horrible, I left feeling more stressed then when I arrived after only two out of five nights. I will NEVER come back!!"
Craigleith Provincial Park,James Forbes,5,Beautiful right on Georgian bay 
Craigleith Provincial Park,Chris Gardiner,4,You'd think being right beside the highway would detract from the bay view and nature feel but it's well treed and all of the sites are reasonably close to the water so you don't feel like you're beside a highway. A bit surprised how much the parking cost for us to visit friends who were staying there though... 
Craigleith Provincial Park,Phil Johnston,4,Nice place. Sort of busy but fun.
Craigleith Provincial Park,Ryan Livingston,3,View is beautiful but park is right on the highway. Never camped here but I amazing the highway noise would be annoying all night
