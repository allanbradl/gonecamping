Pancake Bay Provincial Park,D L,5,"Good Campsites, although I would avoid the ones that are right next to the highway as there is lots of noise from the passing trucks. Fantastic Beach with great sand and clear water. Water is a little cold, but it is lake Superior. ..."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Jessica king,5,"My favourite camping spot!! Clean, sandy, beautiful beaches, great campsite sizes, usually great neighbors & all around wonderful experience. Love it here!"
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Andrea Hajt,4,"Gorgeous beach! Look forward to returning but they really need to work on the campsite outhouses. We could smell them on the regular from our campsite (not good when you're trying to eat, relax or enjoy campfire!)"
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Janette S,4,"Beautiful beach on Lake Superior.  Many nice campsites, but some are way to close to the highway.  I wish they would close the first row and let it fill in with bush as a bit of a buffer.  Suffers the same reservation issues as all Provincial Parks."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Jordan Wentzell,4,"Excellent stopover for road trips through sparse Northern Ontario.  Great for camping, and also some of Canada's best wood carvings available nearby.  Nicely located for a stop between Thunder Bay and Sudbury."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Dara Schraft,5,"Great place to stop, get gas, stretch your legs, and shop.  They also have a little deli which was convenient because I was staying in a motel down the road.  I hope one day to get back with more time to look around their very cool shop.  Very friendly service.  I'd highly recommend stopping by to have a look around."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Denis Gagnon,5,"Incredible sandy beach with a dedicated section for dogs. Today all the dogs were well socialized and on leashes. Cool water, hot sand and a warm breeze made for an excellent day at the beach. It's a great spot to bring the kids because ..."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Bill Ducat,5,"Excellent beach! Camping spaces can be a bit tight for big rigs however, so be careful."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Doug MacIntyre,2,"This is a place that i held great expectations for since i came here as a child.  Very nice area, but the toilets are seldom pumped out and many of the trails are in need of serious maintenance.  We had complained about people running ..."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Andy Fyon,3,"Nice campsites, but a little noisy because of the highway traffic. Beautiful beach. Cell service coverage. Evening (movie night) and day programs offered primarily for kids. My main complaints was the delay in removing ""boil water ..."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Mike Scott,5,"One of the few spots where you can actually enjoy swimming in Lake Superior. Very nice park, but busy all summer long."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Jan Greenhalgh,5,One of my favorite places to visit relax and shop . Local artists crafts . Great variety
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Alan Steed,5,Loved camping there. Spots are relatively private and service is good. Swimming is awesome with a long sandy beach.

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Gary Coleman,5,Very clean wonderful and helpful staff. Been coming here for over 12 years and will be coming back for manny more. Hope to see you there
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Adam Schaubel,3,"Right off the highway, nice beach but lots of garbage left at sites from previous campers. Could use more trash cans. Still beats a motel!"
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Farrah Anderson,4,I normally don’t leave reviews on things but since we have became interested in camping I heavily rely on reviews of each park. I don’t care much to read about how many bugs there were or how loud children were or about dogs barking ...
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Ken Degrow,5,One of the best provincial parks in Ontario in my mind. The beach alone reminds me of the Caribbean.
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Amy McGonegal,4,"It's a massive campground. Lots of kids areas, and a huge beach. But so much busier then we're used too.  Inexpensive, showers, toilets and electrical hookups, sewage dumping, water filling stations too."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Shane Barill,4,Would have given 5 stars except for the fire ban. I like cooking over open fire. Just not camping without fire.
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Taylor Jean,5,"Pancake Bay Provincal Park is located right on Lake Superior. The sites are quite private as they are densely treed. We went in the beginning of May. The park is open, but there is no one at the front gate and it's self serve camping, at ..."

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Mayukh Chakraborty,4,"Decent place, a bit too far from the GTA, but it's a good option if you can't find something closer to your city."

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Sandy Galloway,5,Pancake is always welcoming. Clean and family oriented even for the 4 legged members.
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Cristian Bodnari,5,The park is basically a strip of forest between the road and the beach. Very long beach and gorgeous view of Lake Superior. Be prepared for cold weather because it is so up North. It has the same setup as most provincial parks
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,David Leins,5,"Can't beat the beauty of it all! The acceptance overlook was an easy hike, 2 hours round there and back."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Andrew James,5,"Pancake Bay is a paradise 45 minutes north of Sault Ste. Marie.  The campground is large and it's easy to get a site without booking too far ahead.  The beach pristine and completely sand, there are shower facilities, a playground and ..."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Holly Brown,4,"We camped overnight here. It was beautiful getting to wake up beside the beach, looking out on the lake. Highly recommend it even though the water was freezing!"
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Paul Blanchon,4,"Stunningly beautiful beach and bay, with a well-run campground. Disappointed that we couldn't have a fire though."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Edward Claxton,5,We have been going to Pancake by since 2007. We have stayed in the Yurts at the south end of the park. Those yurts are near the park boundary so that they effectively have a private beach area. Very few people wander down that far. We ...
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Daphne Tot,4,"Awesome long sandy beach. Clear water. Great kayaking at park and nearby. Many pull through trailer sites and large tent sites. Have flush toilets, laundromat and showers including WC accessible showers and toilets. Shower water cold near end of day. Have firewood for sale."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Sandy F,5,I loved this park! Its clean people are close enough but not too close and even the sites that say they arent private are pretty private. The beach is super clean but I would suggest wearing water shows near the beach is pretty rocky. its a super romantic park if you get a spot near the water. I had a blast!
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Sir Veillance,1,$120.00 to cancel my reservation over a month before my reservation date. I did all the work online to reserve and cancel. No human interaction and I’m out $120.00. Ridiculous cancelation fees.
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Kelly Zytaruk,5,"Awesome sandy beach.  Marks almost the halfway point between Toronto and Thunder bay.  I always spend the night here when I am driving the trip back and forth.  Clean showers with hot water!

A little expensive as a stop over just to ..."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,claudia mosher,3,"Long skinny beautiful campground that hugs a narrow strip between the highway and the lake. If you pay the premium for lake front sites , it's a lot nicer ... except that every really nice campsite  seemed to be occupied by a monster RV ..."

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Mark Smith,5,Incredible beach and family campground.
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Autumn Urquhart,4,"The signs for the campsites were hard to see and werent in great spots, we spent almost 15 minutes trying to find our site (a long time considering the size of the park) and you can hear the traffic from Hwy 17 throughout the entire ..."

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Chris Connors,4,"It has a great atmosphere, easy to access campgrounds, great hiking trails, and friendly staff. Camp sites are a little close together but with proper positioning of the car and tent privacy was available. The beach is nice sand and lake superior is beautiful as always. Lost one point for close distance to highway. "
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Ivan Kerr,5,"Beautiful, clean, and quiet."
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,jenny keller,5,"great bathrooms, it was rainy when we went so didn't spend much time at the beach. beautiful nature,  friendly staff. only thing was that it is very narrow piece of land between the lake and the road so you can hear both the waves and the big trucks driving by on the road all night"
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,David Zub,3,maintenance of outhouse less than great
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Sylvie Berardelli,5,Amazing beach and amazing campground.
Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Tabitha McCarl,5,"Every campground is gorgeous as well as the beaches and hiking trails. Just be aware that you cannot park off certian areas of the highway without your parking permit displayed, watch for signs. If you are camping I would only recommend ..."

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,cybaun B,3,It's a very nice park to stay at.   Quite a few of the lots are still subject to Hwy noise (think transports at night).   Downfall is the price per night for their lots (powered or non powered).  Another star lost is for no water on the ...

Pancake Bay Provincial Park,Tom Wicks,4,"A spectacular lookout is located a few km from Lookout Trail Road and a sturdy staircase is provided.  I tried to make a trail run of the 10.5km loop, but the trail in early June was quite overgrown and missing many markers. I ran about ..."
