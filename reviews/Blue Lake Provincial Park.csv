Blue Lake Provincial Park,Christina Perry,5,"Camping at Blue Lake is a wonderful summer tradition for my family - we've been coming here for 15 years!  Lovely beach, hiking trails to suit every fitness level including a trail that is wheelchair accessible, great interpretive centre ..."
Blue Lake Provincial Park,matt ferber,4,"Massive campsite with lots of amenities (Hikes, beach, interpretive centre, showers). It was a bit too much of a party campsite (noisy, drunks, etc) and very expensive for my tastes but it was also like a friendly little town during the day.

And no floodlights! Nice place overall. Bring earplugs."
Blue Lake Provincial Park,Eric Carlson,5,Always a beautiful place go. Especially if the weather is good. Lots of trails to explore and the lake is as cold as can be. Have been going for the past 16 years.
Blue Lake Provincial Park,Shaun and Angela Martin,5,"Small but packed with beautiful campground, forest and hiking trails for its size. Beautiful clear water.. One of our favourite places in the region."
Blue Lake Provincial Park,Morgan MacDonell,5,"Great sites, beautiful & cold, clear lake for swimming. There are many nice hiking trails for every effort level and ripe blueberries growing along one of them! The interpretive center was a quiet building to escape the heat and the lady on staff was very knowledgable about the local flora and fauna."
Blue Lake Provincial Park,Merc J,5,Best provincial park I've ever visited. So many events always on and beautiful beaches. Park staff is fantastic. I recommend anyone going through vermillion to stop by.
