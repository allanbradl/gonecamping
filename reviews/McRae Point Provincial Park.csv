McRae Point Provincial Park,suzanne walker,5,"Well managed Campsite, were in the south side with no electricity yet preffer the North side with electrical outlets. Sand swimming area waist deep. Showers always have hot water. Start your fire early around seven to drive out the mosquitoes. Great nature hikes and nature enhances intimacy."
McRae Point Provincial Park,Cakelaine,5,"I cant say enough great things about this lake and campground. I found this place this past summer and drove 1.5 hours to see it over 10 times during the summer. The lake water is always warm, clear and the little minnows are friendly. Staff keeps these grounds clean and safe"
McRae Point Provincial Park,Sherman D'Souza,4,"Really nice park. They only allow 6 people on a site and they considered my 2 year old niece as a full person so we had to pay for a second site, which felt like a cash grab. Really no reason for the rule to be as such especially with ..."
McRae Point Provincial Park,Traciee Stafford Pollard,5,Great beach and camp sites. Good owners. Shower stalls are clean.
McRae Point Provincial Park,Ed Lawlor,5,It was really nice. Lots of areas to see the water and a great picnic beach. It might have been different if it were busier because the sites all seem really close together in the north section but it was good while we were there.
McRae Point Provincial Park,Ryan,5,I come here every year and its always a fantastic experience. The staff on hand was helpful and fun to talk to. The site is kept really clean.  ^_^
McRae Point Provincial Park,Marcus Fuchs,5,Great place for suburban camping. Not too much of a deep forest and close to a major town. Well worth it for families and kids. Beach Is great.
McRae Point Provincial Park,Sreedev S,3,One of the most perfect camp grounds ever. Nice and big with grass. But the provincial park is rather small and there are better beaches than this. But not all the camp grounds there are good so pay attention to the pictures.
McRae Point Provincial Park,Steve Dangle Nation,4,"Small Park but very well kept, staff are friendly and helpful. Bathrooms and showers are very clean for our off-peak visit. Pull throughs have large sites but not much privacy. There is one trail running the perimeter of the park and along the water."
McRae Point Provincial Park,Lisa Buchanan,3,"Average park - most beautiful campsites ever ... can get very close to water with your own path down. Clean facilities, friendly staff. Mosquitoes were a major issue - probably better to come here in fall. No easy spots for shore ..."
McRae Point Provincial Park,Ron Antle,5,"Great place. Clean and lots are very spacious. Comfort areas are very clean.
This our second visit here. We will be back again and again."
McRae Point Provincial Park,Jenn Gaudet,5,"Great beach, large sites with shade. Beach is all sand and shallow for a long way out; perfect for kids. Adults can swim out past the buoy for deeper water."

McRae Point Provincial Park,Christine R,4,"Lovely park with many well tree-shaded service sites. I was there Canada Day and the beach and park did not feel crowded.  4 stars though until they add more night visible trail markers. In the summer heat, I try to run before dawn. I ..."

McRae Point Provincial Park,Anna Drexler,5,"Loved it, beautiful views!hg"
McRae Point Provincial Park,Fred Chard,5,Very nice campground
McRae Point Provincial Park,candy hoang,4,Nice and close to the city but far enough to be away from the crowds. Water is shallow and warm but there is so much geese poop on the grass. Campsite was good. Close to the washroom and tap. Nice small hiking trails that are good for the kids.
McRae Point Provincial Park,Joe Zipperer,1,"Did not like it the campsites are too open with no trees, felt like Im camping in a regular public park.  No privacy at all everyone sees what your doing at all times. There are far better places to go for REAL up north camping experiences."

McRae Point Provincial Park,Bianca Florea,1,You can't park anywhere on the park property and go for a walk without paying a parking fee. (daily fee). It's ridiculous! !!!!!!!
McRae Point Provincial Park,Paul Braithwaite,5,"What a great place for camping swimming, boating, relaxing and biking. I'll be back!"
McRae Point Provincial Park,Gabriel Cerqueira,3,"The park does not seem to be maintained very well. Garbage was all around the campsite attracting racoons the entire stay. I ended up leaving a day early.

Beach strip is very small, be wary of potentially busy days.

Park seems more of one for fishing and boating rather than camping."
McRae Point Provincial Park,Nasir N,5,"One of the best camp grounds in Ontario. Clean, friendly and very safe. During the night there are patrols to ensure safety of all campers and reduce any noise or misbehavior. In terms of facilities, they have access to electric sites, ..."

McRae Point Provincial Park,Clasher's Corner,4,Good low budget park.
