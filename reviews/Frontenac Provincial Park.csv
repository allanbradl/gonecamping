Frontenac Provincial Park,David Warner Henderson,5,"Went on the May long weekend to Camp 7 site C.

Hiking to the camp site is 5 kms from the office parking lot, however the incline/decline can be +/- 80feet in some locations.

The trail is pretty well maintained however over the course ..."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Pavitra Ram,5,"Just about my favourite place to hike, ever! And it's rarely busy, you won't bump into a lot of people on most of the trails (well, the ones that aren't right near the main office). The scenery is ever-changing and you won't get bored. Remember to get a parking pass and display it!"
Frontenac Provincial Park,Elisa C D,4,Expansive trail network on classic rocky frontenac terrain. Interesting info center and well-maintained campsites for canoeing or hiking.

Frontenac Provincial Park,M. Lopez,4,"Went to the park for some hiking and there are MANY TRAILS to.choose from. Actually, remember to bring your coupon for car parking. If you happen to be staying around longer, Foodland has a promotion to get your parking free if you buy ..."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Heidi Csernak,5,"March 2018 : We walked the Arab Lake Gorge Trail - a walk along a boardwalk through the gorge and wetlands area, then you make your way up to the ridge for the return hike.  It was our first time, and we vowed to return.

I can't wait to ..."

Frontenac Provincial Park,Tadic Zolinski,5,"Amazing lookouts, well maintained trails. Just be aware there are ticks."
Frontenac Provincial Park,yahav barnea,5,Beautiful park with nice trails. Service was good. It's $15 per day per car
Frontenac Provincial Park,Michelle Duclos,5,Excellent place for beginners to backcounty camping. My 8 year old and 12 year old liked having a privy near the campsite. I like having a bear box so I didn't have to worry about hanging my food. The animals are not used to seeing people so a fawn wondered into our campsite to look at us!
Frontenac Provincial Park,Jane Dewit,5,Clean.  Respect for nature is obvious with amount of garbage (very little).  Friendly Parks Officers. Well marked trail systems.
Frontenac Provincial Park,Nick Prentice,1,One star based entirely on one cluster of “back country” campsites that have a very busy hiking trail going straight through them. All day long loud hikers walking by next to us and even using our toilets. Also boats pulling up to swim ...

Frontenac Provincial Park,Ciaron Walsh,5,Beautiful. Salmon lake was one of the clearest lakes I've ever swam in!
Frontenac Provincial Park,Elliot Grady,5,"Park staff are always very nice and very informative. Sites, facilities, and trails are well maintained. The sites are a little close together in the clusters so not a lot of privacy, but every site comes equipped with a food storage box and an enclosed privy box."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Sarah Pidgeon,5,"One of my favourite parks in Ontario. A solid list of trails to choose from. I recommend the Slide Lake loop for a more remote trail, or the Big Salmon Lake loop for an easier hike."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Heather Simmons,5,Lots of well maintained hiking trails with a wide variety of distances for all levels of hikers.
Frontenac Provincial Park,Ben Schroeder,5,"Great park to get away for a hike. I have been to almost every camp site in this park and found that most were well taken care of and in great locations. I enjoy the diversity in landscape and lack of people. Overall, a wonderful park that I think is often underappreciated."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Carl Andre,5,Great introductory park to backwoods camping lots of lakes and trails are good.
Frontenac Provincial Park,Tanya Borojevic,5,"I was recently here for a few days and it was almost great... please note that the park is stunning including the drive up from 401. South Frontenac area is beautiful!

Frontenac Provincial Park,Tckin1761@gmail.com Chapman,4,"Very Peaceful. Saw snakes, turtles, several birds including wild Turkey and of course chipmunks and squirrels. Beautiful setting and we will return."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Martin Lavigne,3,"Nice park and sights. However could easily be improved by:
1. Needs to add it's trails to Google Maps so people lost can perhaps find their way and exact location using their phone GPS 
2. Needs to make some paths clearer and mark with ..."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Sina Lk,5,"A great park for camping, amazing campsite.
Staff are amazing if you won’t be there during the office hours they will provide booking over phone."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Rob Hird,4,"Great park. Very knowledgeable and friendly warden team. Very clean and not too busy, although I did go in the middle of December. Hiking trails are well marked and camp sites are clean and well equipped. Would highly recommend a visit."

Frontenac Provincial Park,Jen Murray,5,"Great trails, well kept and well marked, and beautiful views."

The trails are well marked and maintained. All sites ..."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Ricky Wiehr,4,"We went for a hike in late Fall. Did not see anyone on the trail. Trails are reasonably marked,  but watch where you are going, you can loose the trail. The terrain was rugged, we are eager to explore other areas of the Park."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Jessica Finnie,5,"Just got back from a 4 day camping trip to Frontenac. It's really a lovely park, with easy trails and good swimming. Makes for a rewarding and relaxing trip, but definitely not challenging. Also the sites are extremely close together, ..."
Frontenac Provincial Park,Nhat Nguyen,4,Good hiking trails. There are a few that you can choose depending on your ability and time. Going around the lakes and seeing the beaver dams was an interesting experience. Beware the black flies! Probably best to have a net/mesh to cover face since bug spray did not seem to work.
Frontenac Provincial Park,The Outdoor Canadian,5,Amazing park. Almost nothing your can't do here. Great office staff.
Frontenac Provincial Park,Evan Woodley,5,Great park for canoe or hiking trip. The trails and sites are very well maintained. The sites are in clusters so be prepared to be camping close to others.

Frontenac Provincial Park,Jérémy Vachon,4,"Great location, client service was excellent.  I would add more garbages near the backpacking trail heads.  Would also be nice to have a cheap trail map available for free/small fee, instead of having to use the one found in their newspaper."

Frontenac Provincial Park,Joel Bryant,5,A mystical gate to Ontario's backcountry

Frontenac Provincial Park,Willard Meyer,5,Great parks for hiking.
Frontenac Provincial Park,Craig Pinkoski,4,"Typically not too busy with lots of options for hiking, trail running, kayaking, skiing and snowshoeing. Backcountry camping with no frontcountry camping available....avoiding the clutter of car campers into the park.

Frontenac Provincial Park,Karlie Cowie,5,"Great interpretive centre, nice day use area.  Looking forward to going back to do some hikes. "
