Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Edgar D'Costa,5,"Fantastic place to camp. Very clean campsites and bathrooms.  Would definitely visit annually.  Camp staff are very polite. I called them to fix my electrical problem at the site and they were there within minutes.  Thank you for making my camping trip, one to remember."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Carey Haight,5,Fantastic campground I been going since I can remember.  Nice size lots for trailers. Clean bathrooms can be very busy some families hog the showers . Beautiful beach walking trails and the store all within walking distance. Plus wild ...
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,poppazon global,5,An awesome place on this beautiful earth of ours - come and experience this most wonderful place for yourselves
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,nitin khandelwal,4,Its a awesome place for camping. We all loved it. The first sign post to the entrance was of a bear scare. That was sufficient to excite us. Overall the place is great with nice Beach.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Lauren Avery,5,"Lake of Two Rivers is a beautiful campground! My family and I went twice this year – once in June and another in September. The campground has such a unique feel as it is mainly filled with giant, towering pine trees. The campsites, for ..."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Peter Thompson,4,"Beautiful campgrounds adjoining a great lake. Situated just off Highway 60 so there is a decent chance to have a moose sighting. Often the sounds of loons, wolves and other creatures at night. There is also the sounds of the highway ..."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Valerie Fox,1,"Our stay here sucked as there was a fire ban on the day we stay there. 
We were unable to cook any food or have a campfire at night. So we just set up our tent and starved.
Spent the night and left first thing in the morning.
 Otherwise ..."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Dean Potter,5,"This campgroumd is very nice. Store close buy, sells coffee and breakfast. Has some awesome lots. Bathrooms always seem to be clean. Showers are used alot so floor is always wet. Makes getting dressed tricky."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Gary Burandt,5,"Awesome variety of activities to do such as paddling, biking(family & MTB), hiking. Very nice lake. 
Not enough washrooms in campground, but showers are good. Poor privacy on most sites.
Store, restaurant and bike rental shop are convenient."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Chelsea Bilton,4,"Nice campground, but very crowded. We stayed at site 18, which was closer to the beach and quite large! Camp staff were nice, and warned us of a bear in the area. washroom was well cleaned. The beach was closed due to algae, so we didn't get to swim, or dog did enjoy the dog beach."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Ad 31,2,Nice camping with an appreciable beach but toilets are never cleaned. Also not operating!! As it is already small capacity if you had toilets blocked it becomes complicated. Also no trash available in the park except at the entrance ...
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Haresh Oad,5,Wonderful beach with both electric and non electric camp sights. The beach is smooth sandy and clean. Canoe’ can be rented through portage canoeing company for on site delivery
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Jobie68,4,Easy campground for tent trailer setup and close access to all the trails. Always a bear problem at these sites so pack carefully and keep food locked in your car. Pretty nice beach here and bike trails along old railway bed.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,George Gomes,4,Beautiful clean park with nice beach. My two sons learned how to kayak and loved the experience. Would love to back soon.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Juan Navarrete,5,"Amazing place. Nature, great landscapes and clear sky at night. This is a place to relax, have some fun and enjoy Canadian nature. You will find lots of activities to do depending the plan and everything at the park seems to be taken care of."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Narges Zare,5,Great spot. Large camp sites and the park is amazing specially during fall time.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Maria Zwarycz-Calberry,4,"It was really nice and peaceful during the week, however Friday night became loud. Even though Park staff drive through nothing is enforced.  Another dumping stationed is needed in this park. 
Such a beautiful park with so much to do. Caters to the needs of different campers."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Steven's Motors,5,Nice sites. Great place to bike and swim. Perfect for the whole family.

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,John Recchia,4,"Biggest Dear Flies I've ever seen, pretty sure they had teeth. Really didn't like the fact that water fill and tank emptying was off site. Otherwise a clean campground with helpful friendly staff."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Dave Helm,5,"Great place. Lots to explore in the area. Just be mindful of the bears. 
Its there place and we are the visitors."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Stephen McKean,1,"Be prepared to shell out the big bucks for permits in this place.  Wardens adorned in ""bulletproof "" vests play tough especially with unsuspecting visitors."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Ken Senter,3,Mew Lake Yurt # 39 is fabulous
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Algonquin Voyageur,2,Sites quite open. Camp alot in Algonquin and only here once. Kids didn't like it which was enough for me.

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Ana Ferreira,5,"This is an amazing campground in the heart of the Algonquin Park! Staff is great, campsites are big and washrooms are clean.    The store's got everything you might need in case you've forgotten something at home. Beautiful hiking trails! The lake is great for canoeing!"
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Dave Miller,5,"Very nice campground lost of nice sites. Although I will say not alot of privacy in any of them almost like Walmart parking with trees and a fire pit. 
It is all right but if you are looking for a place to get away it's not here."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,akmeet kaur,5,"Can definitely go again n again . It was a perfect beach campground , didnt expect it to be great but love it."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Rose Kirby,5,One word: awesome. Going again as soon as I can. You see BEARS!

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Andree-Ann Saulnier,2,"Very busy campground with low privacy and few busses of schools kids while we were there .. so not very relaxing.

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Paul Fraser,4,"Two Rivers Park is in a good location as far as access to many hiking trails, and surrounding lakes within Algonquin, and you are in a good location to do a lot of exploring. So if you are just looking for a park to setup and then day ..."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Tammy Ouellette,5,Always enjoy this park
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,john bennett,3,Vwey nice clean park but very noise recomend site away from hiway as far as posible there is a store and cafa but everything is triple the price

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Kim Gibbons,4,The campground is one of my favourites of the provincial parks and they've done a lot of work clearing trees this year.  2nd year in a row where the sanitary station ran out of potable water early on Friday evening of the long weekend ...
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Mason Evans,5,Love camping here early in the season. Alot of bugs but not many people!
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,paul poulin,5,Great campground.  Busy and some of the sites are a little less private than would be nice. Occasionally has a algea bloom in the lake which affects the shower and swimming.  Water is trucked in but short in supply.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Henry Van Dyk,4,"Decent campground, facilities and beach staff are nice too"

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Dimitri C,5,"Absolutely love this campground. All of the staff are very friendly here and the facilities are well kept. The lake here is awesome for a relaxing swim or for some games, and the beach has a great volleyball net. I try to come back here every year and the staff are the main ones that make that happen."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Lounzia Leila Malti,5,"Algonquin park 
I miss this quite and relaxing place"
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Kim Switzer,4,Beautiful but too busy on weekends
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Charlotte Demers Landry,3,"Campground with very low privacy,not a lot of trees or bushes between camp sites. Beautiful pine trees everywhere however, there's a lot of sap dripping on your tent and picnic table. Two nice beaches, good views on the lake, possibility to rent a canoe."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Timothy McGrath,4,"Good selection, on the pricy side though."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Douglas Williamson,4,Lake of two rivers is a little louder than some of the other campgrounds in Algonquin and is very open (less privacy).  It is still very central and has a great beach and canoe launch with excellent swimming areas.  There is a good size separate dog beach on the far side of the boats area. 
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Taylor Moorby,4,Helpful staff! Thanks for all the info!
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Hong xiang Zhao,5,"Very good, like the view and quiet campground"

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Joe Colautti,4,Closed in the winter unfortunately
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Kam,3,"A great place to check out the fall colours via a canoe, but not the most private of campgrounds... I'd say, it is a great place for your first time camping, but if you are looking for a more secluded and private experience, try one of the other campgrounds. A bonus is that you can canoe over to Pog Lake etc., no problem!"
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Steven Wertheim,5,Great campground!
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Steve Sage,5,Haven't actually spent one night yet...but...I know from what I've heard that it is gonna be super-incredible!

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Kelly Matthews,5,The best place for camping
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Mike L,4,Great through the week but the party animals come out on the weekends.  Park staff don't seem to control them much and takes way from the camping experience.  I like to party as well but who comes to Algonquin to get plowed? Algonquin is to reconnect with nature.

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Jordan B,5,"Awesome campground, especially along river"
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Brian White,3,Nice and close to the lake & beach but no flat areas to place a tent which meant sleeping on a slope.  Not much privacy and notable noise from Hwy60.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Garrett Perry,1,"The Campground itself is nice and the location is great. However, the Park Wardens are the problem. I don't recommend this site to anyone other than families. My group was treated extremely unfairly and ruined the entire experience. Look elsewhere."
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Algonquin Tripprr,3,"Overcrowded, but if your looking for convenience and access to hwy 60 trails ,it doesn't get any more convenient than this campground "
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Srinivas Chitta,5,Amazing. Highly recommend the beach & two rivers trail.
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Val Strambu,3,"Great location and I loved the tall pines. Not too much privacy, but the sites are quite large. However there is one serious problem...One washroom & shower facility per 100 sites! That means up to 500+ people for three showers(total), ..."

Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Anrasha Lee,5,Awesome
Algonquin  Lake of Two Rivers Campground,Sir Steve,4,"I agree with Vale Ntin ... great location but not enough washrooms and toiletts. When we are here only 30% of the campgrounds are used ... and that´s ok - but not more!

Sehr schoen gelegen, grosszuegige Stellplaetze im Wald ... aber nicht zu dunkel. Unser bester Campground in ON!"
