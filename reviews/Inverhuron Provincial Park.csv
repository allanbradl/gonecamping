Inverhuron Provincial Park,sebrena hesch,5,Fantastic campsite. Can't wait to stay longer next time three nights doesn't seem like enough. Lots of paths and trails love the swimming area. Both Rocky and Sandy areas depending on what you want to do. Kids enjoy jumping off the rocks. If you are a camping advocate this place is a must.
Inverhuron Provincial Park,donny richardson,4,"Recently updated facilities and sites. Very private large sites. This place needs a huge upgrade of the electrical for the serviced site.

Inverhuron Provincial Park,Donald Keay,5,"Stayed in one of the rental cabins (built just last year I believe).

Inverhuron Provincial Park,Courtney Ecclestone,5,"Sites are large and private for the most part, the new Holmes Bay section is obviously too new to have the site coverage.

Inverhuron Provincial Park,Jason Fournier,5,"Beautiful spot!  Great sites, with good amount of privacy and tree cover.  Hearing the waves from pretty much anywhere on the  campground was a huge plus for us.  Only 10 minutes from Kincardine as well.

Inverhuron Provincial Park,alison wright,3,"This was a very pretty park, but speaking as a tourist from overseas, provincial parks are too overpriced for a short visit. We only wanted to have a walk as we drove by, not come in for the day. This would have been over $14. Why not have a 'taster' price for an hour or two?"

Inverhuron Provincial Park,Jessica Bourgois,4,It is a pristine park.  Trees! Very few mosquitos. Quiet. Private. Clean. Good staff! Helpful. Garbage disp. is a long walk. Elect. outlets are far ...but they loan cables. Quirky (gov't) reservation rules.  If you want nature and your ...
