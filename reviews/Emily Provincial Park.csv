Emily Provincial Park,Justin Majik,4,Excellent park. Came here as a kid and brought my family here in June of 2018. Pigeon river is very weedy for fishing but if you find a spot you can get some nice fish bass/musky. Facilities were clean and the beach was consistently ranked in the mornings. Awesome dock for your boat/fishing as well.
Emily Provincial Park,Radhu Vijay,5,Nice park to visit during summer months. Charcoal Barbecue is allowed. Children’s play area is nearby the water.
Emily Provincial Park,selam belete,4,"I had a fantastic time at Emily park. Was there for 6 nights with 3 kids ages 8 to 10. They enjoyed their time at the south beach, swimming, fishing and walking the short trails. Truly speaking, the park and what it has to offer is good. ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Hailey Batchelor,5,"Have been going here since my childhood and it's a fantastic park for camping. The trails are great, they've done lots of work on them.  Every campsite has decent privacy on at least 2 sides from my experience. Washrooms are always in ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Sarah Nisbet,4,We had a great experience at Emily park. I think it definitely depends on what type of camping you're looking for. We could hear a lot of other people but the wardens must have done a good job as they mostly quieted down shortly after ...
Emily Provincial Park,Jaison Parayil,4,"Our family enjoyed the beach (there's 2 small ones to choose from), and the playground, but we really appreciated the shows and activities that were put on by staff.  Shower/toilet facilities were relatively clean too.  Will return again."
Emily Provincial Park,Sheryl Evans,5,Love this park. The washrooms we are using are some of the best we've experienced. Love that there's place for all your stuff and sufficient hangers! Staff are awesome as well. Very polite and helpful.
Emily Provincial Park,Lisa Synard,3,Clean park as expected from most provincial parks. The staff are very nice. The sites were ok. Our site was great. Large with a decent amount of tree cover but some people in our party had sites that weren't as private. The beach was ...
Emily Provincial Park,brent Chase,4,"PLEASE READ.
Remember you are in nature's back yard.
Site 211 has a permanent thief that lives and steals. Yes, this is not a joke.
Red squirrel steals lighters, keys, buns, or anything you may need under your screened In gazebo. Don't hurt him or them. They don't know any better."
Emily Provincial Park,Lisa Chan,4,Nice clean place with family-friendly activities and friendly staff. One thing that is needed is a few more informative directional signs to key areas like the Beaches and Convenience Store. I helped someone looking for the convenience ...
Emily Provincial Park,Gary Mark,5,"Stayed here for a few days in August 2018.  Staff are absolutely amazing.  The site we stayed at (#307) was huge, but had a pretty hefty slope to it.  I had run out of 6x6 to try to level out the trailer.  I asked staff at the front of ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Ian Emmons,4,"Spent 3 nights at Emily in August. Its a fairly large campground. Has equipment rentals, a parks store of course, and the two boat launches are very well kept, with new docks and parking lots."
Emily Provincial Park,Magdalena Stoeva,5,"Great little park. Close by to a city. Clean facilities, tons of programs for younger kids. The beach area was nice, but the 'sand' was more clay like, kids enjoyed getting dirty and building things. Needs an EV charger."
Emily Provincial Park,Paul Kuznecov,4,"Really nice park but they need to have a nice place for dogs to swim. Currently they can only go in the water at boat launches which are weedy and dirty. Staff are friendly and helpful, sites are private and beautiful. We stayed on circle and it was great. We cant wait to go back."
Emily Provincial Park,Jennifer Wilson,3,"Lovely campground - very private.  Our campsite (108) was also very nice.  However, we had heavy rain our first night, and quickly discovered that we were at the lowest point in the park - rain run-off from three different roads flowed ..."
Emily Provincial Park,simon mak,3,The beach is full of algae and water is not as clean as the southern part of Toronto beaches. The camp is not big and easy to go around on bike. Camp staff is very friendly and helpful. Washroom and shower room are cleaned frequently. We stayed on RV site and overall is quiet.
Emily Provincial Park,Laurette Ginglo,4,Yes go there every year for a Family reunion annually on the September Long Weekend.  The guy at the front desk this past year was ignorant and really was not helpful in anyway and directed us in the wrong direction to the open Family ...
Emily Provincial Park,Diana Barbour,5,I really like camping at emily park. The sites are nice and big and the beach is nice for the grandchildren. Unfortunately I can't take my dog on the beach even though I always pick up after him. But those who don't spoil it for those who do. The staff are very friendly and the park is very clean.
Emily Provincial Park,Jon Douglas,5,Super clean with great showers. Walking trail is very short but the boardwalk is finally being rebuilt.
Emily Provincial Park,Brian Bad,4,"This is my first time camping at Emily Provincial Park. Campground is very nice. Bathrooms are modern and are fairly clean with a large amount of shower capacity, 7 shower stalls where I was at. I've read other reviews about the beach ..."
Emily Provincial Park,andrew robertson,3,"Overall decent experience good staff at the gate and terrific staff at the parks store, but we were on the same group site as we have been on for the last several years, and they still haven't fixed one of the washrooms that's been out ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Diana Robson,3,"The park is smaller compared to other provincial parks and it has two nice beaches , however no dogs are allowed on the beach. We stayed at one of the group campsites and it was beautiful however there were only two comfort stations for a campground with 320 campsites so be prepared to line up especially on a long weekend."
Emily Provincial Park,Dave Spence,3,"If you get to the park too early, meaning before anyone in the booth is there. Look out for the pay area and place your slip on the dash. Was there a few ago fishing, didn't see any pay spot, so went into the park, figured I would pay on ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Veronica Lord-Annis,4,They made renting a canoe for the afternoon very easy. I will definitely be back to see more of the river.

Emily Provincial Park,Dave Weicker,5,Stayed 2 nights June 2018. Huge site #286! Quiet at night. A little noise from nearby highway. Staff were all friendly and helpful. New upgrades to some roads and the dump and fill stations. Definitely book here again.
Emily Provincial Park,linda stewart,3,"The RV sites are beautiful, the staff very friendly and efficient. I have never seen such fabulous fill aand dump stations.

  I found the ladies ""outhouse?"" by the centre beach deplorable. It was dirty and because I was desperate I used ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Jade Legacy,5,This is the most amazing provincial park. It's so beautiful. The beach is amazing for campers. The public use beach is ok but still pretty good. The playground for kids is really neat. Definitely worth the trip.
Emily Provincial Park,Gangsta Bob,3,Usually only go here for the group sites. Has many differnnt water fun things for rent like paddle boats and canoes.
Emily Provincial Park,Willy Weiss,4,"Waterfront nice, sites a good size. Bug free this mid Aug weekend. No water connection @sites."

Emily Provincial Park,Belinda Junkin,4,"I have camped at Emily Provincial Park a few times each year.  It has a nice beach for children to play and docks setup to allow campers and children to fish, which I haven't found at many provincial parks.  I have always camped on the ..."
Emily Provincial Park,Maria,5,Clean facilities and a nice beach. I really liked this campsite and the hiking trails (although they were short)
Emily Provincial Park,Meg Pill,3,"Not a bad place, but not worth a long drive just for camping. Just an every day place."
Emily Provincial Park,Andrew Hannaford,3,"Good park, busy and small. Nice area and good for boats though. Bathrooms could be redone as they're showing their age."
Emily Provincial Park,Syed Shahenshah Hussain,5,"Had a terrific weekend, as part of a campaign. Heard from other folks at the park that it's better than other provincial  parks around the East end."
Emily Provincial Park,jason m,2,Used to be a great park. Now wardens must have have something better to do at nights. Drinking and yelling all night with adults peeing all over their sites. Bad experience this time 😠
Emily Provincial Park,Johnny Lim,3,"Not a bad camp site the staff try to keep everything clean, except the beach need some work."
Emily Provincial Park,MissHexe,1,"Emily Park isn't going to waste anymore of my time by writing a detailed review, but long story short.. We've been here a couple years ago and it was the best weekend we've had. We went labour day weekend this year, and it was a waste of ..."

Emily Provincial Park,Baris Tumok,2,"I'm here at the moment, super disappointed and extremely angry with myself because I booked this weekend without making enough research.

Emily Provincial Park,Marietta Castro-Vega,4,"The park itself is good, the staff great but our camp site was littered with garbage kids candy wrappers, beer caps etc. Really parents this is how you teach your kids to be respectful of nature"
Emily Provincial Park,Jen C,5,Beautiful quiet park close to home and nearby small towns.

Emily Provincial Park,Duncan Irving,5,"Great park, nice big sites, great beaches"
Emily Provincial Park,Megan Taylor,3,"It's a very small provical park. With only one beach area. The water is not the best for swimming. It's good if u just want a quick weekend getaway or if u have small children, since the swimming area is very shallow with a sandy beach."

Emily Provincial Park,J. R.,4,This place is nice but has really changed quite a bit in the last few years. The popular boardwalk nature trail was closed and the second beach was closed. It's a nice place to canoe if you but on the weekends motorboats regularly drive ...

Emily Provincial Park,Orion Boyes,1,Place is only for kids and family's. Park rangers will nonstop harass you otherwise. They even told us they were following us on our 30 min nature walk just because. There was no pretense of suspicion. Unfortunately it wasn't busy that ...

Emily Provincial Park,Eric strongestkarate,4,"Joined the learn to camp program with our 3yr old son. Place is very convenient, clean washrooms and safe.
The guides were amazing (Nik and team). Friendly and knowledgeable staffs.

Place is highly recommended for kids with young children. They also have a place to fish and gears you can borrow for free."
Emily Provincial Park,Pauline Robblee,2,"Reserved from Jun 08-11/17.  First of all, had to move from site 248 to 252 because ground too wet!  Understandable however there was a huge pile of gravel in front of our site which made it impossible to maneuver our 39' RV plus pick up ..."

Emily Provincial Park,Kody Walton,5,Great place for time away for you and your family. I go there every summer 
Emily Provincial Park,AJ Alexander,3,"Overall, not a bad park.  Took just my son for 2 nights.  Fishing wasn't that great though, way too many weeds close to shore.  
We booked a campsite backing right onto the beach (#140).  It was quite convenient, but although there were cedars blocking the view between the site and beach, it was quite noisy."
Emily Provincial Park,Hubert Nguyen Trieu,4,Too many alge and weeds in water
Emily Provincial Park,Dave Long,4,"It's close to the people who live East of Toronto. Easy to get to and staff are very friendly.

Boat launch on site with lots of docks. "
