Kettle Lakes Provincial Park,Nancy Lee Corscadden,4,Good sites for small trailers. Tent sites are a little sloppy and quite far from the laundry and shower facilities. The facilities were all clean and well maintained. The water was good tasting - a refreshing change from some other campsites we've had in our travels.  The staff were extremely helpful.
Kettle Lakes Provincial Park,Ken Leg,4,"Very nice and organized camping ground, great beach area. Polite and helpful rangers (staff). Organized events for kids in weekends. Beautiful area, I'd recommend it for anyone looking to camp in the Timmins area."
Kettle Lakes Provincial Park,ross Mather,5,"There was nobody at the park. Had it pretty much to ourselves. Great site, facilities and landscape. Would go back in a heartbeat!"
Kettle Lakes Provincial Park,Ashley Bousfield,4,I enjoy winter walks and summer swims in this Provincial Park.

Kettle Lakes Provincial Park,Angie Van Esch,5,"Our family spent a month camping here, and loved every minute of our time! 
The lakes are beautiful, grounds always clean, staff helpful and friendly. They have a number of large, fairly private campsites. 
After our time spent camping, we returned on several day trips to swim, hike, and BBQ. "
Kettle Lakes Provincial Park,Jim Morris,5,Always a great campsite or day visit to the lakes.  Well kept and close to a full convenience store and LCBO.  Also close to Timmins but definitely has that Ontario Provincial Park feel.  GOOD TIMES.
