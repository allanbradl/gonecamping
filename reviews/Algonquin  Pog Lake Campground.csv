Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Lucie Morillon,4,Beautiful location! Although no lockers for the food at the camp ground. Close to the Centennial Ridge trail (the lookout point is worth the hours on the trail).
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Lindsay M.,5,"I really enjoyed it here. We were with a group of friends and two dogs and we all had an awesome time. Our campsite was huge, the park had great amenities, a beautiful little lake and beach....it was a great way to spend a long weekend. We would go back for sure - even with the 3 hour drive."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Amanda Stewart,5,Good place for car camping. Algonquin Park was beautiful and being right on the water at Pog lake just added to it! The sites are a little close and there is little to no privacy on the sites close to the lake. We were a few rows back at ...
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,C K,5,"My mom started camping in Algonquin, Two Rivers, back in the 60s with her family. In 1980, she started with her family. I have so many amazing memories here. When I was a kid, campground C had lots of seaweed, but that's been gone a ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Cheryl Riches,5,This is my favorite campground in algonquin. I have seen moose and bear wandering around inside there campground. Washrooms are clean sites are generally good and the beach is nice. Of course if you plan on visiting on a long weekend in ...
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Alex Dashti,5,We live in London and visited this park in August 2016. The most amazing camping experience we've had. The lake and canoeing was fantastic.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Michael Seabrooke,5,"In my opinion, one of the best car camping options in the park. The sites are beautiful, private, and fairly quiet; the lakes are calm and easy to paddle; the beaches are pleasant and offer fun swimming; and overall it feels like the complete package."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Shiva Teja,5,Awesome place. We got lake side view. Good facilities but too many mosquitoes in this place. Be prepared well before visiting this place.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Ashley Cardinell,5,"Just went to Pog Lake for the long weekend with a group of five, was a wonderful time. The sites are pretty close together relative to your neighbors and the spaces were quite small for three cars and three tents, but overall wonderful ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Bruce Macdonald,3,Nice campground as far as provincials go but trees really need to be cut back if they want to attract larger rigs. Too many places where trees played havoc with our unit 34' 5th wheel. Algonquin Park is a delight though.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Grant Williams,5,Friendly staff willing to help.  Park rangers very knowledgeable and they go the extra mile help. 1st time there and will be be back next year.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Brad Richmond,3,"3 of the 5 showers in our campground were ""out of order"" for almost the entire week we were there. Showers were not cleaned very well. I've stayed here for years but Id have to say the maintance is ""slipping a bit""  for what you are made ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,bijan sakhdari,2,"Showers and toilets were not clean. Facilities were not enough and we had to stay in long lines each time for showers. Pog lake itself is a very small lake which does not worth visiting compared to other places in algonquin. 

Our campsite, itself, was big and nice tough."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Kevin Pearce,3,"I had site 151 which was nice. Power available on site. Room for a hammock and space to play without being on top of the picnic table or campfire.

Firewood was and ice were available for purchase at the check in centre. 

Musquito's ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,grant williams,5,Great staff and awesome campsites. Nice lake for swimming and lots of wildlife.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Paul Eagles,4,"This year we spent 15 nights in the Pog Lake Campground. The campsites, beach, forests and roads were fine. But the water and washroom facilities were a major problem. There was polluted drinking water the entire time we were there, with ..."

Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Darrin Christy,5,Absolutely beautiful spots and beach.  Well maintained facilities.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,CN Corpus,4,"Bear safety is their top priority.

Never having camped at a provincial park, I never knew there were a lot of rules. We misplaced the sheet of rules and what a mistake.

At 1 the morning, some rangers came by and told us we had to pack ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,shantia ghorbani,1,"Staffs are so rude,dirty area,They just pick the first time camping's experience people to give them fine.
Never go again"
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Scott Howells,3,"Buggy, great location near day hike trails."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Andrew James,5,Loved Pog Lake!! Lots of great sites nestled in among the tall pines - creates the perfect camp setting.  The facilities were clean and the park well maintained.  The beach at Pog Lake isn't great but there are other beaches within  a ...
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Payam Zakerzadeh,1,"Very bad and dirty area without any responsibility and care, washrooms are really dirty and full of mass maskit staffs just trying to find a stupid reson to getting ticket never coming back again"
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Daryl C,4,Beautiful lake and large trees. One of our favorite camping places.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,John Martin,5,Great spot with nice lake access
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Lindsay Reed,1,Absolutely terrible. If you're looking for real camping with anything even close to slight silence and the sounds of nature turn your car around and head north west. We waited years to get to Algonquin assuming it was all the pictures ...
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Debi Durbano,5,Loved it! Nice sites
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Eric Lanning,4,"Pog Lake is a fairly popular campground in the beautiful Algonquin Provincial Park.
This is probably the quietest and least densely populated area of the park that is not in the ""back country"" in other words for ""car camping"".
Be sure to ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Mikhail Kabakov,3,Typical car camping campground.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Shariq Khan,5,Pog Lake at Algonquin Park is so beautiful and perfect for swimming and canoeing and there are some campsite facing lake. Washrooms were very clean during our visit. Always book the canoe online in advance or be there at the lake at ...

Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Irfan Aleem,4,Nice campground overall
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Meghavi patel,4,"Campsite was good, not as crowded as Lake of Two Rivers.  Not too many mosquitoes.  However, we went on the weekend, and there was a lot of noise coming from other campsites during the weekend.  It may have been a party it seems.  The ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Tyler J,1,Dirty washrooms and RUDE staff. Doesn't get cleaned in three nights we were there. Not going back here again.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Ken Eresmas,5,"Stayed @ site 190. Had very good seclusion, big site. 1 min from the lakefront/beach. Right next to the washroom and showers which were impressively well-maintained. Great for canoeing, connected to many other lakes via rivers. Caught 5 fish in the lake! Awesome would definitely recommend!!"
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Lisa Hampel,5,Beautiful and secluded camp sites
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Jason Hau,5,Had an amazing time here. I've been camping for 15+ years and so far this has been one of my favourite spots since I got to stay at such a beautiful site off the water. 
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Julie Wood,5,Beautiful. Lots of bugs
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Stephen Weppler,5,"Lovely campground, some sites are more private than others, I got 105 which is an end site so nobody on the awning side of my trailer, nice big site, comfort station about 100 meters away, beach close as well. Arrived on the Sunday on ..."

Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Serguei Melnikov,5,Beatiful provincial park. Awesome camping. Great place to bring kids!
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Kirk Hovell,4,"Great campground. Good sized sites compared to the average site size in Ontario. Not much privacy but campgrounds with privacy are rare. If you can, get one of the sites near the water!

There were bears in the campground during our ..."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Carlin Scuderi,5,Huge campsites with great privacy. Canoe rentals and lots of places to canoe! I absolutely loved it here and would come back again in a heartbeat.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Miriam Boyle,5,I love this camp ground! All sites are spacious and have good access to water. The lake is calm and a perfect place to start out on a day long kayak trip. Have been going there for years!
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Neyaz shah,5,Good for large group camping
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Norman Wise,5,"My favorite of all campgrounds in Algonquin. However, it is a pine forest with little ground cover. If you want more ground cover for more privacy you should keep to anything at the west end of the park."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Dan Cojocari,4, I really enjoyed being close to the lake. It makes it easy to rent and take the canoe out on the lake and rivers around the site. Not the best water to swim in though.
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Evan Gibb,5,"Great sites, nice central location along the highway 60 corridor, and good access to the larger lakes nearby."
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Artur Kink,5,Probably the best campground in AP

干净，蚊子不多，公园服务态度很好"
Algonquin  Pog Lake Campground,Nicolas Bartels,4,"(Translated by Google) Nice places, very quiet and a place with good cell phone reception, which is not of course in the park. Washrooms somewhat rustic.

(Original)
Nette Plätze, sehr ruhig und ein Ort mit gutem Handyempfang, was im Park nicht selbstverständlich ist. Waschräume etwas rustikal."
