Algonquin  Kiosk Campground,Philip Harmathy,5,"Very nice location for drive in camping. Lake is beautiful and there's a nice beach to go swimming. Most of the sites have a nice view of the lake, and the stars are beautiful at night on a clear day. Not sure how this campground is managed though as I was unable to find the camp host or anyone in charge of the place."

Algonquin  Kiosk Campground,Jeff,5,Great entry point for a canoe trip in beautiful Algonquin Park. Located between the cities of Mattawa and North Bay. Very convenient entry point for people from outside the region.  There is also an reputable outfitter located nearby. Love it and will go back!
Algonquin  Kiosk Campground,Sanjeewa Abeykoon,4,More closer to wilderness. Excellent for canoeing and it is very well connected to isolated lakes inside the park.
