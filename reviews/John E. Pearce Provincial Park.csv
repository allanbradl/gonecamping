John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Manushi Gera,4,"It was an adventurous climb down the slippery, muddy cliffs to get to the water. The water was too muddy to swim. So we didn’t. Very rocky shore. I collected some nice pebbles. Extremely solitary. We were there Sunday evening of the ..."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Clayton Holmes,2,"It's ok... you can't actually access the beach anymore, it's all fenced off because of erosion.. it would be good for a picknic or something"
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Dennis Ryckman,4,"Beautiful. Varied habitat, wetlands, coniferous and deciduous forest, grass plains, ravines, hills, lakefront cliffs."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Jim Madden,4,"Small, out of the way... but, with a bald eagle in the area and all the history surrounding the park, it makes for an excellent all day venture."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Andrew Cruickshank,3,"Small park with short road to walk along and a small picnic area.  Water access was fenced off when I was there, so mostly just trees and low lying plants."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Chatravi K,5,This is a stunning rare park classified under natural environment. Many don't even know about it except the locals. With interesting rocky shores and trails it's a must see. Clean facilities and trails. Beautiful and we'll preserved. Good staff and good for hiking and biking
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Darin Higgon,3,"Meh. Nice easy walking loop and beautiful forest, but the bluffs are fenced off far back from the edge, so you can’t really see or get to the water. I suspect somebody had some trouble once and ruined it for everyone, so they just closed it all off. Too bad. Not everyone needs to be protected from themselves."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Jeff Atkinson,5,Great small park for hiking and nature watching
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Heidi Hering,5,"Took a drive through and they have the path all fenced off now. You can't get to the cliff anymore because of errosion of edge, kind of disapointing because it's a gorgeous view of lake Erie

Still a nice sheltered forest walk full of ..."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Anne Miller,5,"Spicer's trail is pretty, unfortunately you can't see much of the cliffs because of erosion. They were re-enacting something at Bacchus place and set off the cannon which surprised us."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Kristin Gonda,4,nice hiking area!
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Branden Grasley,5,"Most of the good trails have been closed by the lake, due to erosion. However there are many trails on the other side of the road"
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Huda Al-Sharafi,3,"You do get to see a good view, however you have to climb through a fenve to get there. The park needs a lot more care and maintenance. I only spent about 30 min there cz not much to do"
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Cindy Tweedie,5,Trails are very well maintained
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,kay janssens,1,"About a week ago I drove from London to Pearce Park.  There is no longer a pak.  It has all been fenced so that there is no access to any trails.  It is now just a short circular road, with a fence all around  where you drive in and the ..."
John E. Pearce Provincial Park,Paul Barrett,1,"This park has been ruined.  John E. Pearce Park had been a magical place and probably one of the most beautiful spots in Ontario.  A small park with a beautiful forest that abutted on one side, the old graveyard and final resting place ..."
