Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Daniel Millar,5,Made the trek from Toronto once for camping and it is definitely has become one of our regular spots for camping for now on. We had a site right by the lake and it was amazing. Rapids were really fun too.
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Robert Brunsch,5,This park is incredible! We stayed for the week after Labour Day - and our side of the park emptied out after the long weekend. Staff were friendly and did not bother us. Park bathrooms were clean as were the showers. We can't wait to book our site for next year!
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Robert Higgins,5,"An amazing park, with excellent facilities, sites are big with lots of space. Beaches were clean and lots of ample space to wonder and explore. Fishing was good as well. Lots of different water bodies to explorer. Highly recommended for ..."
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,claudia mosher,5,"Wonderful woodsy campsites. Quiet and spacious. We had # 174 which has a nice waterview but it was listed at the park store as a ""pull-through"" ... Which might be true if you were on a motorcycle; otherwise you'd have a tree as a hood ornament!
Really nice flush outhouses but there's a boil water advisory"
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Dianne Hanson,5,Loved it so much we are coming back this coming weekend despite the cooler weather!
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Hirak Padh,5,"Amazing park and super friendly park staff..... we had everything as we were told...super clean Comfort Station...with Shower facilities......

Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Doug Armstrong,3,"Cool park, the lazy river is awesome.  I would return, however read below.

Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Pauline Ulman,4,"Beautiful park, small, but lovely. Trails are great and the camp sites have decent coverage between each other. There are some gorgeous sites right on the river or the lake. The biggest issue is that they advertise a dog exercise area ..."
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Robert Caverly,4,Nice park. It's not very busy this week. Late September. The only issue is the road going into the park is really rough in a few places. It definitely needs to be repaired.
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Bruce Kessler,4,"Reading other reviews, most I agree with, especially about activities and beauty. Pulling a 30' 5th wheel, though, these sites are definitely not large. Choose carefully if you are making reservations unseen. Many sites are not level, ..."
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Isabella Juskov√°,5,Beautiful park. I loved canoeing on the lake here. Really worth the drive up north.

We were evicted within 5 hours of being there, simply because ..."
Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park,Michelle St-Onge,1,"Online stated that there were ‚Äúnon reservable camp sites‚Äù we also called to make sure this was correct...
