Rondeau Provincial Park,laura m,5,"Absolutely love this place! It's so beautiful! I went near the end of October and all the fall colours were great. Love the dog beach, it's so big! So many animals around as well, I saw deer more than a handful of times"
Rondeau Provincial Park,Megan Dyksterhuis,5,"Awesome fishing, clean campgrounds, decent beach, do your research on the site you book as there are a lot that are full sun all day with few trees for hanging hammocks or clothes lines. Washroom and shower facilities are clean and mostly bug free."

Rondeau Provincial Park,Bob Bjelis,5,Great park. I wish our governing authority saw it a priority to rebuild the peer in the bay and the lookout tower on the trail. Otherwise this is an awesome park. Lake on one side and the bay on the other. Awesome beach and perfect for all kinds of water activities.
Rondeau Provincial Park,Emma K,5,I missed the most incredible picture of a sunset but the place was beautiful and fun to explore on our small boat. If you are camping look at the map as we felt we were a little far away from the washrooms. The campsites vary in privacy ...

Rondeau Provincial Park,Ontario Canada,1,Greed has over come the sense of public service . Unnecessary charge at the entrance 15 Dollars what a rip off. Nothing much to see inside the park.  What a waste of money. First drive hundreds of miles to get there and then pay this ...
Rondeau Provincial Park,Jodi O.,5,"I love Rondeau. It's only an hour from Windsor and they have a nice beach...except the dog beach, which is all rocks and not great for walking on unless you have shoes on.
