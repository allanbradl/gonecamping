Very well kept park! Cant wait to go again!"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Nancy Berry,4,"I like the spot we chose, it seemed more secluded than most. Weekdays make for a better, quiet camping experience. There is a dog beach, our two dogs liked swimming in the lake. Great place for kids.

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,David Kingston,5,"Went here to get away from the city for a day and it was fantastic. Had a great BBQ. The water was nice for the kids to swim and play in. It was far enough away that we didn't feel like we were in civilization but only an hour or so to get home. 

I would recommend this park to any one."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,D Wallen,3,Nice park. Just be prepared for a long wait to fill up with water if you have a trailer. Our wait was 2 hours.  Very poor water pressure. We thought we had arrived in lots of time to get set up in daylight but the wait for the water meant we had to set up in the dark.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Christina Brinklow,4,"Sibbald Point is a very large park. There were many parking areas, picnic areas, basketball nets, volleyball nets, covered picnic buildings and camp sites. Of course Sibbald is known for its famous beach. Well kept and perfect for the ‚Ä¶"

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Lawren Wetzel,3,A decent park that is close to the city.  The water access is ok.  The boat ramp is large but shallow and it can be hard to launch/load up when there is an east wind as there is no break wall protecting the ramp.  The pricing is also ‚Ä¶

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Shayini Mathan,5,It's a very nice place to have group outting.  Can swim there too but be careful of the slippery rocks on the side.  The sunset is simply amazing!
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Samuel A,5,"Honestly one of our favourite provincial parks. It‚Äôs close to the city and is always a safe bet to unwind from stress. The campsites we‚Äôve ever stayed at were fairly private and maintained. The beach is nice, and as it‚Äôs Lake Simcoe the ‚Ä¶"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Mike,1,"Worst park I've ever been too. They gave us a noise complaint ticket for $180 because they told us they hid in the bushes and were listening to what we were saying, I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. Absolute joke of a place, these volunteer park ‚Ä¶"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Pascal Nkenglack,4,"Liked my staying there. Didn't like the ticket for parking in the wrong spot though.

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,mohammad kiumarsi,5,"Very close to the city, nice park, good staff. The washrooms are clean. Fairly nice campsites, it has a good beach and boat lunch! Overall very nice park for day stay or camping . Keep in mind it gets pretty busy during weekends and holidays"

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Lippy Heller,3,We stayed at site 341. I found it small and very basic - imagine a grass parking space for an amateur UFO... Which I found wanting for the $50+ price point. Since it was a weekday I was able to book a site that was surrounded by ‚Ä¶
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Dillon Sendler,2,"They only have one trail. They say it takes 1.5 hours, however, it took me and my girlfriend only 20 minutes to complete whilst it rained.

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Keena J,4,"I had tons of fun, we stayed in the radio camping sites. Our neighbors were friendly and the campsite was clean. All the things in the Parks control was super good, but the beach was super dirty maybe because of the long weekend. And they have so many spiders. All the spiders."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,andries laya,4,We came on long weekend labor day. Surprisingly the beach weren't pack as we thought it would be. Enough space on the beach and on the water to play. Park staff patrolled for garbage & washroom regularly. Alcohol banned was in effect but ‚Ä¶
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Jason Wong,4,Decent place to get away that's only a bit more than an hour away from Toronto. That also means it's pretty popular so expect lines to get in on weekends. Camp sites are pretty good although you will hear other camp sites as it is all car camping. Still pretty good given the location.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Tanya Simon,5,Our church goes there every year. The park is beautiful. The view of the lake is breath taking. Great place to take your family for camping or a day at the beachüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüé£ü§Ω‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüöµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Elizabeth Tchervov,5,"There are two beaches, a sand beach and a stone beach. Both beaches are very lovely, kept clean by park staff, but on the stone beach there are a lot of itty-bitty little lobsters that get washed up on the shore. The trails are ‚Ä¶"

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Ice Monstah,4,"It's a nice park that's not too far away from the city, so it's great for weekend escapes without being too far off the grid. The park was very busy but I mean it is a holiday and that is to be expected, I arrived around 4pm and the line ‚Ä¶"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Kevin Qu,4,"Provincial park that accessible to most people around the GTA, but there are so many people and the provincial park has turned into a sort of park you would find in a city. Has none of the charm that a provincial park like Killarney would have, but a great place to start out."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,pamela erickson,5,Cycled there during the week when it wasn't too crowded. Overhaul going trees provide welcome shade. Water warm and easy access for swimming
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Lance R,5,"For $20 parking you can spend the day at the beach.. good facilities and space for you to relax for the day!! Been going here since I was a child, now I take my own kid there to make her own memories... great way to spend a day!!"

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Leila Binesh,5,"Great camp site, very close to Toronto less than 1 hour. Warm and pleasant water and great sand beach. Totally recommend it"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Donna McEvoy,4,We had a great time. I guess the only reason I am not rating it 5 stars has nothing to do with the park itself and that it was just too busy!  First time visitor....we will be back.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Irving Santana,5,"It's the first time i camp in Canada and i could say it was a wonderful experience, everything is super clean. If you want fresh air for your lungs and you're close to Toronto come here and have a peaceful night and jump into the lake Simcoe."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Augustin Petre,5,Great spot to swim and SUP paddle board
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,The Storm,2,"This park is disgusting. It's full of dog poop, stinks and has way to many bugs. (Bugs you will be terrified of and ones you won't find anywhere else) The beach and park area is ok. The area for swimming is way to small and it's crowded, ‚Ä¶"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Beata Rancourt,4,It was busy on the weekend but not during the week. Comfort stations were clean. Lots of sites are private. Average beach with a nice playground for kids.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Shazam Khan,3,"A great Park to hang out lots of trees cover parking is 20 bucks per car when I was here with a group of five people, the beach is very muddy so buy some swim wear and get a pair of waterproof slippers if your going in the water.
And be early for parking otherwise its jammed up."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Brave Little Britch,5,All time favourite park so far. Very nice beach and plenty to do. Eldon hall is a great place to visit in the park for a look into the past.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,James Moutoux,2,I will start the review first by saying the staff at this park were extremely pleasant and friendly. They were very enjoyable to engage with and were always waving when passing by. Even when they were cleaning up left over garbage at a ‚Ä¶
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Hooman B,3,I've been here numerous times for day use or camping. It's good for beginner campers. For a day use of beach close to Toronto it's great although Simcoe doesn't have the best water. The biggest problem with it is lack of showers in the day use area.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Valeria K,5,"Beautiful camping. Clean, quiet and very friendly personal"
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Nathan Jousmaki,5,Well maintained park that has plenty of space. The rocks at the beginning of the shore should be removed. The beach is tilled nicely. A good idea to arrive early!
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Orsi Almonte kun,4,"it's a nice park if you want to go camping not far from Toronto

Overall, a good park for camping."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Aren deJong,3,"Really super busy on weekends because it's so close to Toronto. Lately the day use beaches are filled with inconsiderate mindless people that have no regard for the fact that they ought to share the space with others. 
Otherwise, the beach is pretty good and the park camping is decent."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Cakelaine,2,Meh beach. Literally always jam packed. Grounds are clean but just way too many patrons for me. Be prepared to wait for a parking spot and try and snag a picnic table by 8am

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Mike Walker,4,"Perfect week, thank you.    A few out of order showers is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, but not complaining."
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Rachel Kaunismaa,2,Generally very crowded on the weekends. I think there are much nicer beaches around Lake Simcoe that aren't as popular. Parking is also quite pricey.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Christian Barnes,4,Good family fun. Sometimes a bit crowded but that's to be expected being so close to the city. Been coming back for years as it's great to get away without the long drive and on short notice. Clean sites. Showers available. Be sure to ‚Ä¶
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,UTRA MOTIRAM,4,Very busy...the water is messy with sand and such close to the shore as a result. There is a dog park as well.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Simon DaimYar,5,Beautiful park beside the beach for picnic.
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Deonne James,1,No words. No words. Washrooms were a pool but can't blame staff but users of park. Not worth camping just visiting
Sibbald Point Provincial Park,George Wang,2,"Really don't understand why there are sooooo many people going to this beach.   Costs $20 to enter, the parking lot is huge to accommodate the masses of cars.   The parking area is also unpaved, which will have your car coated in a thick ‚Ä¶"

Sibbald Point Provincial Park,Kristine Quirk,4,"We were pleasantly surprised by this park.
