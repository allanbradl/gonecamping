Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,RQP INC,0,Great view of the lake. However the site were so close to each other with absolutely no privacy.  I would use this site as a last resort for car camping. Washroom facility was good and clean
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Aaron Cat,0,Even though we arrived late they were OK with us not checking in until the next morning. The bathrooms are beautiful. We got site 115 and it is right beside the water across the other side of the street. Loons calling at night is amazing but the best thing about nighttime is the stars and Milky Way galaxy in the sky.
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Denny Hill,0,"Park officers think non white should not be allowed to camp and enjoy the nature.

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,We stayed at this campground over the long weekend. At first we were worried about the lack of privacy and how close together the sites were. This was the least of our concerns. On our first night I was sitting by the fire by myself with ...
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,This campground suffers from a complete lack of privacy. You can see from literally one end of the campground to the other. Your neighbour can probably reach over and stir your coffee in the morning. ||||It has a trailer sanitation ...
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Andy Fyon,0,"Efficient, friendly check in. Lovely, but very open campsites because of the red pine trees and little understory. Nice beach. Have stayed 2x."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,kyung-in Moon,0,Most of camping spots are so close each other. But perfect for beginner!
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Tyler J,0,"Road to camp site is not paved. My car all got dented. We found it noisy and when we told PARK RANGER about people making noise in other camp site, they told me that that's how WHITE people camp. Camping is not for COLORED people. He told me to go back to my SLUMS. Guess I am not going to go here again."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Jamie Thomson,0,"Very loud, lots of people with no etiquette. Garbage everywhere honking car alarms."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Christina Trigiani,0,"Definitely one of my favourite campgrounds in front country Algonquin.

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"Our campgrounds were 112/114 by the lake. Such incredible views, never camped right by the lake before.  My only two concerns was the lack of privacy due to campsites being too close together and the park staff could really do a better ..."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"This is my favourite campground in Algonquin park. This is a yearly trip for my family. We have been in the spring, summer and fall. We have never been disappointed. We love it because it is about 10km from hwy 60. Traffic noise is at a ..."

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,paridhika kayal,0,"We stayed at coon lake the campsite was good and the beach was not crowded. However, the tap water was full of mud; not even suitable for cooking. We had to use lake water for cooking."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Jade Goodwin,0,It is pretty open (i.e. you can see basically everyone and everyone can see you) but it was still a pretty nice place to stay.

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Spicer Cook,0,My favourite campground in Algonquin Park.  The farthest to get to from the West gate. Highway 11 side. But well worth it.  Nice beach area. The drive up and down Rock Lake Road is tranquil.  A little bit busy on statutory weekends.

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Andrew Byers,0,Amazing trail views.
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,Eric Lanning,0,"Rock Lake is not an ideal campground.
It is very densely populated with a fair mix of trailer campers and some simple car campers.
The sites are not very private or well segregated from each other.
I only recommend this campground for larger parties of 8+ people."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"To find a good camp site , you need to count the dates they open up for reservations , usually six months ahead for summer long weekends . They have first come , first serve locations , you may have to take a chance and drive up to try ..."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,Stayed there nights in early May in the electric section.  The sites are close together and lack privacy.  The views of the lake make up for this though.  You can be on any site in the first 2 to three rows and still have a water view. ...

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"We have been camping in Algonquin Park for over 20 years, and staying at Rock Lake specifically for the 15 years. We hadn't been able to get up to Algonquin for the last 3 years, so this trip was way overdue.||Rock Lake is a much quieter ..."

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"Three friends and I went up for the 24 weekend. At arrival we found our site (79, campground B) was flooded. The fire pit had 3"" of water in it. The site was also very small, as is many of the sites. They also seem to be practically on ..."
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,We spent four nights with our family here. The lake itself is quiet and has many islands and beaches. The campground lacks any seclusion. You can see all your neighborsâ€¦ All your neighbors can see you. |It's a great location for other ...

Lots of canoe access areas. Clean comfort stations. Friendly helpfu staff. No cell service. Well worth the stay here.  "
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,We visited with 3 other families to enjoy almost a week away from the city.  The office sells wood and ice and some books and has a pop machine.  The showers are excellent- clean with lots of hot water and privacy.  The sites are very ...
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,On the plus side: far enough away from Highway 60 you won't hear car traffic; very close to Booth Rock trail; beautiful lake to canoe and explore; both campgrounds are close to the water. On the minus side: can be over crowded during ...
Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"Ontario provincial parks keep a limited number of sites as ""un-reservable"" - meaning you have to be there and the site has to be vacant to get it.  In our case (midweek) that meant a lovely site right on the water.  There was a little ..."

Algonquin  Rock Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"The campground is a bit hit and miss as far as the rating of individual sites.  Some sites are very spacious while others are fairly cramped and squeezed in among other campers.  None of the sites offer any real privacy, but during our ..."
