Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Bogdan Dinescu,4,"It's a beautiful getaway for summer. The park it's clean and well maintained and the access fee is reasonable. The staff is very helpful and friendly. There is a pool which is gorgeous, with lifeguards and some shade. There is a lake ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Adam Gibson,5,I ran a half marathon through the park and had a grand time. The park looks like it would be a fun place to come and stay!
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Steve Drenters,5,"Our own little secret in Alliston!  If you have been here before, you'll come again.  Great place just located minutes away of great amenities if you need last minute things.  Fun trails, picnic spots, water fun and well kept.  See you there!üëç"
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Jennifer Pike,4,"Arrived at check in and set up. Decided to swim afterward... Beach was closed due to bacteria levels. Totally fine, can't be helped or predicted and besides there's a pool... IF YOU PAY EXTRA. Seriously. Makes sense for day trippers, but ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,GreenShrike,5,"Excellent camping in the Riverside campground. The ""lake"" isn't great to swim in if you're used to a real lake and not what is essentially a flooded river, but it suffices for boating and they have a large swimming pool for when the lake ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Daniel Hinbest,4,"Absolutely beautiful. I would definitely recommend Earl Rowe. Throughout my week long trip, there was only one downside, the unsafe beach. The pool is lovely, the campsites are wonderful, the staff are very helpful. There are some very lovely trails that were so neat. This is one of my favourite campgrounds."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Will Wright,3,"Some of the best sites you can find but these days the nights are filled with traffic sounds. On top of that, the lake is no longer open due to bacteria levels. Barely a 3, but the sites are top notch and so are the trails."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Lisa Elminowski,2,"Almost everything you'd expect from a provincial park (which is usually pretty good, in my books). The beach being closed KILLED our vacation, however. There was no indication on their website that the beach was inaccessible - in fact, ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Andrew Cruickshank,4,Great park with beach and a number of short trails.  When i was here during the fall hundreds of geese were taking a break in the water on their way South.  There is a swimming pool open during the summer.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Todd Hunter,3,"Not a great park for hiking, especially in the winter! As a summer camping experience it is one of the better near city experiences."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,chris harrilal,5,"Shamefully attended the learn to camp program.  Turned out to be a great weekend.  Staff was knowedgeable, friendly and always available to help."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Samantha W,2,Used to come here all the time as a kid and this was my first time back in over 15 years. Not too far from home for us but I think the trek to go somewhere else is worth it at this point. It was never mentioned when I booked the site or ...
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Chris Miller,5,This is a great park close to the city.  The huge swimming pool makes up for the man made lake that is not much fun to swim in.  The canoes and paddle boats are the best way to enjoy the lake.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Maria Wright,1,My husband and I used to go to this park 3/4 years ago once or even twice a year and both my husband and dad grew up spending their summers here. We went in September and I will never go back. The lake is full of e-coli so it's a ...
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Colleen H,4,Very spacious sites. Matures are mostly evergreens and mature. Pool is amazing when open. Beach is huge but water quality is lacking. Great for canoeing and fishing off the bridges. Actually watch a turtle lay eggs right beside the pathway! Parks are small and old fashioned.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,D. K.,5,Great trails and camp sites. An acre sized swimming pool for when the lake water quality is poor. Laundry and shower facilities. Trailer fill and dump stations. Full LTE connectivity (I'm on bell)
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Georgy Ivashkevych,3,"The park is good in itself for recreation. It's good for families and friends to go on picnic, relax and talk. No swimming facilities though there is a big pool but it is not suited for serious swimming."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Judy Goodhand,4,"Beautiful Provincial Park near Alliston. Has grassy sites, lots of bike trails, a small lake, pool, and close to shopping."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Vitaliy Latanskiy,2,I visited this park with my family at the beginning of september as we like to scout the camp grounds before making booking camp site for next summer.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Gary Quinn,4,Beautiful campground. Great place for a family getaway. Unfortunately it rained for half my stay but I still enjoyed myself.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,diljot dhote,4,Nice place if you love nature. Soccer and volleyball ground if you are into sports. Water not so good but okay for boating.. Around $15 at entrance
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Karen Coral,2,"A nice place to visit for one day, not very recommend for camping. All campsites should have a clean lake where campers can swim or just be around the beach area. This is a whole business. They ensure the lake looks so unattractive that ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,kev chouin,4,"Surprisingly great campground for its location. Private spots, big lake fishing or bike around . big pool for kids of all ages. Great location. Would definitely go back"
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Rosemont Towing8229,4,"Getting a bit run down but all in all a good place to camp, swim, hike..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Sepideh Fallahi,5,campsites are big enough that two or three tents would fit easily in each campsite. You can hike or canoeing too.In terms of campsite privacy is really good too. Perhaps not as good as ArrowHead Park if you have been there but definitely  better than most other place. Plus that it is very close to the city.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Kirill Vasilyev,5,Nice park close to Toronto. Good picnic areas. Very nice walking trails.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,TheMusicjunkie5,3,"I found riverside was the only area with the really scenic sites, but only a few sites had a good view of the river, which was my biggest disappointment. The lake is nice, but if you don't plan to swim or stay for a picnic, it's not that ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Glenn Miller,4,Great park to camp. The water is great for a couple hour paddle. Lots of geese and their waste thoughü§≠

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Tristan Sacrey Productions,5,Been camping there since i was a fetus (literally) my favorite provincial park!
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Ellen Tomlinson,4,Used to camp here as a child and it was my first time back! Loved the camp grounds very clean they have a big pool .you do have to pay $3.25 per adult and $2.75 per child but it's a good alternative to the lake.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Brutis 2012,1,"Terrible!!!!!! This park is a joke !!!

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Mayank Bhatt,5,Fantastic group site. Nice amenities near by. Swimming pool is a bonus.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Tony Citta,3,"Could be a wonderful park, but it has been so  overrun by geese and seagulls that the only swimming option is to pay to use the pool."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Behnam Izadi,4,Great place for walking and BBQ. The lake is contaminated with bacteria and it is not safe for swimming.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Sebastian Lo Monaco,4,Great camping park with very good facilities. It is a shame the lake is always polluted. Maybe something could be done about or it could be stocked with fish for kids to catch.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,John Brunt,1,I did not enjoy my experience at all during the time I was at Earl Rowe. I don't even know where to start. We go to checkin and we are told we need to go to the other side of the street because we are in Riverside. This is absolutely ...
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,M Allen,1,Never coming back. Not enough patrols and don't do anything about people from other sites walking through yours. People throw garbage all over the place. Worst provincial park ever. And shining headlights of there cars into your site from theirs.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Tim Murray,4,This is a great walking park many great trails to walk whether it is beside the pond or by the dam or even along the river there is something for everyone.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Jennifer Demers,4,Great park for kids. River wasn't great because of the bird flock leftovers - yuck
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,edwin guo,4,"Very good place to go for camping. Facility is awesome, electricity, shower, washroom are all available on site.  the only thing that I think is negtive is that the site thay we stay at were bit far from the lake and wd had to drive for 5minutes for that."

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Minsoon Roger Choi,3,Good if you like the convenience of being close to a town for supplies. It does not have clean natural water to go in; instead there is a big swimming pool that they charge you do use. It doesn't really feel like camping with all the ...
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Martin Silveira,1,"This place has gone down hill ever since i was a kid. The water is terrible they keep failing water tests. I would pass on this place and camp somewhere else. You would think that because the lake has ecoli that they would make the pool free, but no they charge you more to use it on top of day fees and camping fees"

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Zee Jeremic,4,Close to GTA campground with nice hiking trails.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Yury Goldaev,5,"This park seems to be better suited for camping than others I've seen so far. Sites are separated way more from each other, so from our site I was able to hear others (good for safety) but not see them (good for privacy). I was ..."

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Sylvia Rhodes,4,"Very nice park. Swimming in the man-made lake is awful, but the pool is terrific, and the price is good. $3.75 for adult admission to the pool. Plenty of picnic tables and canoe & kayak rentals. Food trucks, too. Great place for a fun day. "

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Shauna Featherstone,4,Very Nice Park. Did have a hard time finding site.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,lol kool,3,It's a nice place I think they could have some more maps and a cleaner lake but for everything else it's really nice and pretty
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,tiya h,5,"Its the best park so far i have been to. It has almost everything. You can canoe there, barbecue, a good looking beach, some bridge crossing above the beautiful small lake, hiking and cycling can also be done, including camping and if you forgot something you can go buy them from the nearest plaza which is only 5 min drive."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Chesley Oakley,3,Considered dredging the six inches of mud off of the 4 ft Deep Lake and maybe there won't be so many f ringworm f infections.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Graham Hill,4,"Large beaches, inland lake. A giant pool.
Modern facilities, laundry, comfort stations, ball diamonds, amphitheatre.

Popular destination in the summer.
Though, the lake usually closes to swimming in Aug due to the stagnant water."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,My Life in My Style,4,"It's an amazing place I've ever seen. Great place to go for family camping. The location is not far from some big stores like canadian tire, etc. IMHO, it is worth to give a try and experience it yourself. Recommended..!!"

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Candice Malott-Bennett,4,Very nice...clean.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Diana Chavez,4,So clean very cozy and great camp site. There could have been more shade and the wood they sell is kind of a joke. Doesn't burn very well. PS buy your own

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Paul Lush,5,"I love the sites. You get a good mixture of sun and shade. So depending on when you go ie... spring, summer or fall; you pick in advance the site you need. It's perfect. It has a little lake, boat rentals,fishing, bridges, a dam, fish ladder and trails to explore. Highly recommend you check it out "

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Jackie Manella,5,Love camping here. We typically camp in the sites across the road so they are quieter.The park is busy on the weekend but typically the people are friendly. My only complaint is paying for damp firewood.

in short... AMAZING place..!! "
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Dhang Brown,1,"We enjoyed camping and it was my first time. But the only problem we have is the camping site warden, he keeps coming back to tell us no excessive noise, music and that our tarp is not properly done,etc. Etc. Etc.... and the worst is ..."
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Tbbt Nh,5,Muddy bike ride to the look out great place.
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Elias Shimoun,4,"Its a great place for families to have fun. The water smells like duck poop because it is inhabited by ducks.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Dave Profit,4,Good park.  Little close to rail tracks
Earl Rowe Provincial Park,amber k,1,They conveniently tell you after you pay the entrance fee of $14 that the water has high bacteria and there is no swimming. Everything was disappointing for me.

Earl Rowe Provincial Park,Alexandra Mary,5,My boyfriend and I  like to go on a yearly camping trip every year and this year we chose Earl Rowe - and with great results. We reserved our camp site online with the Ontario Parks reservation guide. There were pictures of our site and ...
