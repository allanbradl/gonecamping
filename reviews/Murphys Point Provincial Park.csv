Murphys Point Provincial Park,Jamie S,4,"Excellent campground. Stayed here in a Tent on May long weekend. Good space between sites, good beach and hiking trails. It is also interesting historical area with an old settlement that you can see on a hike. There are also canoe in sites that we will likely try next time. Store was small, but decently stocked"
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Russ Cosenzo,1,"We spent the weekend here and the camping area and beach are wonderful.

Our only issue was the wardens, in 2 night we had 2 complaint about noise. One of the nights was around 10pm, there was 4 of us talking with no music. We were told …"
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Jen Christie,5,We car camped over the long weekend in Sept here and really enjoyed it although I don't think we fully got to see the whole park. Our site was pretty private but it was a little loud due to a big group staying on the neighbouring sites. …
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Kevin Pearce,4,"Beach is really nice, canoes are available on site.

My particular camp spot was.. Odd. It was not well distinguished from the one adjacent.

The other one wasn't in use, but if it had been it would have been awkward. Right on top of …"

Murphys Point Provincial Park,Tony Citta,5,"Great little park, unfortunately with our luck we camped during a heat wave like I've never experienced before so we didn't have a opportunity to explore the whole park. We spent it time in the lake trying to stay cool. Will be coming back to explore it, especially the mine."

Murphys Point Provincial Park,Rob Brookfield,3,Nice park in a great location near the Rideau Canals. Campground and staff are very friendly and helpful. Campsites are not as private as I would like and the campground is very hilly and not level.  
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Sarah Harney,1,"Have been here a few times before, but won't be returning after our last visit. While sitting around the fire with friends chatting one evening the warden came by twice to tell us to be quiet. It was fairly early the first time, and  we …"
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Carolyn Y,1,The trails are nice. The staff aren't. Literally look for reasons to bother you. We had to clean our site out of broken trees and sticks before we could put up our tent and we got told not to pick up deadwood? Also there were a ton of …
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Ezekiel,4,"Trails could be marked better. Very quiet, and relaxing for a walk/hike. Most of the beach was still under renovation. Generally, could be better."
Murphys Point Provincial Park,Cody Barr,1,I've camped all over Ontario and this is the worst camp site I have visited. The lot management is horrible and looked to never be done even after a camper left. My pit was left in a horrendous manner with over a what looked like a week …

 Just returned from what was supposed to be a three day camping trip with my girlfriend, another couple and their children. It only lasted one night.

Murphys Point Provincial Park,Philip Battison,1,Beautiful beach and campsites. But tell the Ontario Parks Enforcement crew to play some crossword puzzles on the night shift and to stop annoying all the campers. They literally stood waiting outside our campsite for us to speak slightly …
Murphys Point Provincial Park,John Bain,4,"Campground is hilly and makes for interesting driving in the park. Trails were nice and so we're the park staff.

The sign for the daily use beach on  sylvan trail is pointing in the wrong direction."

Murphys Point Provincial Park,Marie Rainville,5,What a beautiful park! Some of the sites are very beautiful but others need a bit of work. It's a very hilly park and that's what makes it so picturesque but some site pads should be levelled off a bit to make it easier to get your RV …
