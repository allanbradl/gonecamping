Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Chip Diamond,5,Amazing national park but it‚Äôs tough to find good companies to rent canoes/kayaks from. We‚Äôve had bad experiences with two different places. The park itself it worth 5 stars though
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,B Mason,5,"Great place. Yes you have wildlife that should be left alone.
DON'T CHASE THE LOONS
DON'T CHASE THE TURTLES. If you see a turtle on a road, move it to the side it was going towards.
RUN away from the bears
If you catch fish that can be released, release them. Then someone can catch them later."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Nigel Peters,3,"After a long and winding drive from the main road Google maps said we had reached - but where?

It was just trees on both sides and a gravel road.It was kind of scary too as it was isolated and very few cars.
I guess we need to make a ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Atomic Chronic,5,Cool trail. Squirrels seem to have a gold tip tail for some reason....
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Ryan Lowe,5,"Just wrapped up a trip to site 301 and it was awesome. Shooting stars at night, long swims during the day... you'd almost want the water to be cooler in August. The park staff are amazing. I forgot to display my permit and was ticketed ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,george stubbs,5,Nice trails. And lots of snow at the rite time of year.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Larry Kirtley,4,We rented a cottage here. Its beautiful with lots of wildlife
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Emran Toronto,5,"This park is way more beautiful than Algonquin for fall colors, hope my review does not make it over crowded like Algonquin"
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Bernie Gasse,5,If your sick of camping 15 ft from your neighbour then this is the place for you.  All the sites are water access only and plenty private.  Big sites with several options for where to setup.  Just spent a night at Cold Lake and was the only person there.  By far the best remote site close to Toronto.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Jordi Martori,5,Great provincial park. We rented a canoe and enjoyed some paddling and picnic. Looking forward to going back!
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Susan Connors,5,Camped on sucker lake site 122.   Was beautiful.   2 portages to get there.  Both portages were short but steep and had lots of roots and rocks on the portage hills.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Luke Russell,5,"Did 5 night canoe camping trip.  Lakes stayed at were Secret, Buzzard, Shark and Stoplog.  Secret and Shark are very picturesque with no cottages, Buzzard is nice too.  Campsites were spaced far apart which gives a very remote ambiance. ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Androo Piek,5,One of the best camping experiences I've had. Private camping. Not expensive. Good fishing. Peaceful as can be.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Faith LeRoy,5,Our favorite place to visit each year. The sites are very well maintained and always stocked with fire wood upon our arrival.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Steve Gray,5,"3 day trip into Mountain lake. Wind at our back on Long both ways! Under 4 hrs with 2 decent portage, a great private lake to ourselves."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Daxton Valyear,5,Really nice place.  If you want an intro to back country camping this is a great place to start
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Nicole G,5,"Peace & Calm, collect your thoughts surrounded by nature."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,bryan hatton,4,If you love the outdoors and dislike the loud car campers like me well this is the place for you! Just a short paddle in and you can start enjoying nature at its best! Love taking a two nighter at this place good fishing and great swimming!
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Tamara Pav,5,"Highly recommend this stunning park for backcountry camping. The wilderness is just as beautiful as Algonquin, as long as you are a portager, you will adore it."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Ryan Taylor,5,Beautiful place to camp. Rented canoes from Long Lake Lodge.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Jacob,4,Great park for introductory backcountry camping. Really enjoyed my backcountry camping trip to KHPP. We launched in at Long Lake and paddled in to Buzzard Lake and then Vixen Lake. The campsites were all clean and well-maintained. Having ...
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,R H,1,"Access from the east is the best, as the west side has access through an existing power boating lake, with lots of boat traffic."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Matt Keating,5,"Not as crowded as expected,  but do see people,  great sites and suburb lakes. Be prepared to portage."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Dave Mole,4,I  have a cottage in the park. It is still a new park so it should get better with time but it is pretty good now
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Everywear Jennifer,5,"We camped in Cold Lake, which was beautiful!  Handy to have the sandbar beach nearby for the kids - a real hit!  Must have forgotten when booking that a picnic table was provided - a nice surprise, along with a fire ring (fire ban ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Simcoe County Roamer,5,"We had a wonderful back country canoe trip! Some obnoxious cottagers on Anstruther Lake, just paddle past them!"
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Phil Jones,5,Too close to cottagers but otherwise awesome!!
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,G T,5,"Our trip was HARD! We camped at Stoplog Site # 564. It took us 2 hrs to go from Long Lake to end of Loucks Lake, then the portages (90m+397m+70m) was a killer took us about approx. 45 mins, then Compass Lake is nice and easy approx 30 ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Mark Simmons,4,Nice place to visit for a relaxing day.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Kirsten Caldwell,5,"I've been coming to the park since I was a kid. Every lake has it's own charm to it. The further you portage in, the quieter and untouched they get. Vixen has always been a lake of choice, only a couple portages (and two beaver dams) in ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Sarah Hamilton,5,Nice spot for a short canoe trip.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,MALAY SHERASIA,5,One of the most peaceful place for connoeing with long lake. Extremely beautiful and calm place to unwind. Visit with family friends and young kids in long weekend and don't miss the connoeing and kayaking. It is charged somewhere around ...
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Pierre Bertrand,4,"Biggest park south of algonquin.  Nice back country camping sites but watch out, a few of the lakes have some cottages on them, so choose wisely.  My favorite starting point is long lake, just for the views as you canoe down to the end."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Rob Meyer,5,"This is a massive Park hard to review. It is huge, so I will only review where I went Lake catch a coma fantastic good Marina you can get gas ice cream at cetera"
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Austin Bates,5,I got a cotty here it is great.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Kevin K,5,"Back country camping here is great. We stayed at Bottle Lake for 2 nights, and Sucker Lake for 2 nights. Sucker Lake seemed to be a lot more quiet. The island site on Sucker Lake was nice because of the lack of squirrels and raccoons, but it was fairly exposed, and thus, rather windy."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Enric VG,4,"Website could be more specific on portage slope, terrain, difference in height... Easier to evaluate difficulty of routes. Publishing the status of beaver dams, water level or density of vegetation could be helpful too. Super nice and clean lakes. Further you go from the main lakes and routes, nicer becomes the experience."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Jay Legue,5,"Beautiful natural setting with no power boats once you get into the back country. Great paddling, beautiful views, pleasant swimming in clear and clean lakes. Take out what you bring in to keep is beautiful for the next visit."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Andrew Roberts,5,"Great spot for intro level backcountry canoe camping. It's not your deep wilderness adventure, but it is beautiful, and it offers an accessible weekend in the bush and a chance to lift your canoe a few times. If I had kids and I wanted a cool spot to bring them on their first canoe trip, I'd come here. "
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Valentin Cristea,4,"Large natural environment park. The deeper you go in interior the better it gets. Not as famous as Algonquin, but you can find some very nice places and little lakes. The park is open year all year."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Calvin F.,3,"Pros:

Beautiful scenery, lakes, wildlife,  and campsites were fantastic and well maintained.  Outfitter right at access point is convenient.  Nice to have sites accessible  by canoe without portage as my ankle was recovering from injury ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Joshua Kubinec,5,"We haven't used the park overnight, but we've used the side trail near Buckhorn and it's a nice easy hike to a cool spot at the end of the trail."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Peyton Sampson,5,"I enjoy this park. This park mainly for canoeing, not ideal for hiking or biking. It's best once you get off the lakes with boats and cottages. We've seen deer and beaver : )"
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Geoffrey Leung,5,"Absolutely beautiful. We come up here for weekend canoe trip all the time. Very relaxing retreat from civilization. Most of the lakes are shallow enough that it's a good temperature for swimming! üèä

If you paddle out at dusk, there's a ..."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Nathaniel Smith,5,"Absolutely gorgeous. Fantastic camping grounds, very clean, nicely secluded from other camp sites. Great spot to get away."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Veronika Rudavka,5,We had a great time here!
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Mohammad Owlia,5,"Very nice and clean lakes, perfect for swimming!"
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Tracy Skates,5,Great place to go tubing and hike
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Evan Woodley,5,"As far as setting up a backcountry canoe trip close to Toronto, this is a good option. Very asscessible. Just be warned that you will come across cottages and motorboats on lots of the lakes, even those that you have to portage to. The further you go, the quieter it is."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Hooman B,5,Great for hard core campers.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Cody McGhee,5,"Absolutely stunning provincial park, spent 2 days in the park and wouldn't of traded it for anything. Lots of wildlife to be seen, campsites are cleaned and maintained, all locations are accurate to map "
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Jaci Zanatta,5,"Great camping, lots of fishing"
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Evan Baird,5,Great trails.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Bruce Lyne,4,Great park for an easy back country getaway. Too many cottages and speed boats on the lake I was on however. 
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Valerie Burrows,5,"I live in a close proximity of the park, it's right in my backyard. We have beautiful deep  clean lakes as we are at the start of the Canadian Shield here.  I walk my dog through the woods to other lakes. There are also portage routes on the lake system. Very beautiful area."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Jason Cymbaluk,5,Unreal weekend at a beautiful site
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Michael Wilson,5,Pretty damn amazing here. Saw a beautiful juvenile black bear on the way out of the park as well on our last visit!
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,James Angold,5,Great canoe experience with campsites bookable on line through Ontario parks. From beginner sites close to parking through to some remote camping with many portages. Well signed portages.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Alex Ahmed,5,Beautiful! No motorboats so it's very relaxing. Very private campsites. Very intimate. Amazing experience. Canadian wilderness always gets 5 stars
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Minerva Sanchez,5,Beautiful views! The lake is beautiful. A great place to be one with nature. 
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Kevin Drummond,5,"I enjoy this park. It's best once you get off the lakes with boats and cottages. We've seen deer, beaver, Martin, bald eagle, snakes, a couple different kinds of turtles, and a few other animals, and have also caught a couple of fish over the years."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Neil Barker,5,I really enjoy visiting this park. There are no entrance fees to just drive through and visit. Some good hiking trails and spots for canoeing/boating.
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,dave Bonenfant,4,Nice park just be sure to lock your doors I had some stuff stolen from my car 
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,mary brown,5,The most amazing place in the world. ‚ù§ natural beauty!

Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Anna Holub,3,"Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park is an enormous territory with beautiful nature, full of private cottages, a marine, and a camping site.

Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Doug Macintosh,4,"Excellent developing Park
Still needs more access points, and ways around private property. More hiking/ski trails would be great."

Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Stephanie Fernandez,5,Trails are great
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Glenn Paterson,3,"It's no Algonquin or Killarney. But, considering the proximity to GTA, it's not too bad. Be aware, there are cottages and power boats in many lakes which detracts from the backcountry experience. You have to travel deep to the interior to escape those."
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Phil Hockridge,5,beautiful scenery and park staff do a great job maintaining the sites and portages
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Harold Asmis,5,"This was the old crown land in the area, now turned into a park.  Take a canoe trip north of Anstruther Lake.  It is absolutely beautiful."

Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Chatravi K,5,Simple and sweet
Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park,Kevin Ryckman,5,Kawartha's gem...Just one problem with trapping cabins close or on the same Lake you camp at...So there could be live active traps close by when looking for dead stands for firewood...Be cautious when traveling through the back of your campsite!
