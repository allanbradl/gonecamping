Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Darius Campeau,0,Love this place for winter camping. Their host system is great and can be a life saver. The staff are all very friend and easy to talk to. Lots to see and do here. The hockey rink makes for fun day time game. There is a fair amount of ...
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Marco Tochijara,0,"Went Dec 18-21 and the park was beautiful. Went with a bunch of friends to hike and photo shoot and we were more than impressed with the trails. There was a good number of them too. A few paths were closed but we still had a great time.
Bonus: wildlife are not afraid to interact with you."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Joanna Bellingshausen,0,We love Mew Lake in the winter.  Thank you to Harvey Cornell for always going that extra mile to make the park such a wonderful place to be.  And thanks for always making that rink so amazing for the Hockey players and skaters.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Snowy Owl Travel & Entertainment Group Toronto,0,"Mew Lake campground is located in the middle of Highway Corridor 60 in Algonquin Park, just before the Lake of Two Rivers Store. The campground is relatively small and beautiful. Some of the campsites have a very beautiful waterfront ..."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,I went to the skating rink on a Sunday afternoon and nobody was there. The skating rink was in perfect condition and there was also a little fire going with a warm up tent. I didn't stay overnight but I did see a few people that had ...
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Jayne Zavitski,0,"Great in all seasons, winter time is a must to experience the ice rink alongside the fire pit. Bring hot dogs and marshmallows for roasting along with skates."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Robert Snider,0,"Awesome place! The campground is well maintained and clean. Flush toilets and showers make it an easy sell for those not really into the back country style camping. 
The beach was a nice soft sand bottom with nice clear water. For the ..."

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Norman Wise,0,Good average campground in the park. One of the best campgrounds if you are pulling a large trailer and need a larger site.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Momo C,0,We have been trying out different camp ground in Algonquin Provincial Park this past 5 years and we liked Mew Lake Campground the best so far. It located about the middle of highway 60 corridor so is easy to access to both east and west ...

Overall such a great experience ..."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Quinn Sutherland,0,Thank-you. Nice staff. Nice campground.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,Now if I had the new Yurt the review would get a 5. The older Yurts are still comfortable and warm but the are outdated. However they are warmer than a tent. The Yurt has electric heating which is sufficient for even the coldest nights. ...
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Ryan Hie,0,"This is only the second campground I have stayed at in Algonquin Park. There is a good sized beach on the small lake. It is pretty close to the highway, so I found it a little noisy with road traffic. Will try a different campground for my next visit."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Gary Clarke,0,Absolute heaven! Only been here 2 days so far but loving every moment. Site and showers are clean. Walked a couple of close trails and the views are awesome.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"After camping at Ontario Parks for most of my life, we finally camped at an Algonquin park campsite.  We got a pretty nice site at Mew Lake campground last minute leading up to Labor Day weekend.  Must have been a cancellation!|The sites ..."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Dawna Rowlson,0,"I love yurt camping and this time we saw moose, wild turkey and fox.  Going back again in February and March."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"This campsite is much warmer than Lake of Two Rivers which is nice for fall. Likely because the trees are much smaller. Downside, the beach does not allow dogs, & there is no dog beach, although the map says there is. The sites are a ..."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Gary Rocha,0,Great campsite with a beautiful view of the lake! Campsite #93. Make sure to bring bug spray and a good camera! Launch your canoe right off the site. One more word of advice get gas and any tobacco products before you hit Algonquin park or you'll have to drive back!!
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Camille Bock,0,"Great campground, nice sandy beach, and the added bonus of a shower station and washrooms! Only suggestion I have, please stop letting people pick all the berries in the field and leaving none for the bears. Bears are now stealing food ..."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Jason Fowler,0,"It's absolutely bizarre why this campground is situated right next to the highway where the motorcycles and trucks are loud all day and all night.  I don't understand why this campground hasn't been relocated farther away from the highway ages ago...  I guess there's only 7,653 km² of park."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Chris Hammar,0,"Great place to bring the family, friends or even just yourself. The campground is connected to both hiking and biking trails that lead to beautiful scenery. The facilities are in good shape and all the camping lots are well maintained. If you’re looking for a weekend in a developed campground, choose Mew Lake."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,rebecca smith,0,"Have been camping here since I was a kid. we bring our children here every year now and always look forward to it. It has a great atmosphere, the staff are great and so are the campers."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Smokin Monkey,0,Nice campground very taken care of. However if you plan to be up longer than 10pm beware you will get complaints and visits from camp wardens lmfao. All in all a nice spot.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"Visited in off season and were delighted with the site, campground and Algonquin in general. We loved Bartlett lodge for a nice dinner while roughing it. The only issue we had was people let the dogs swim at the people beach.|"
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Tyler J,0,"If you are COLORED person, make sure you stay AWAY from PARK RANGERS. They will HARASS you at every turn. It was horrible experience interacting with park employees. They are RACIST.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Algonquin Voyageur,0,Great campground when run by Ontario Parks.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,renaat Schockaert,0,"Did not enjoy this campground at all. Even though it's in a very large provincial park many of the campsites are so close to the road that you can hear traffic from your tent, I wasn't really impressed by the lake itself either and the ""quiet zone"" we stayed in still had people playing radio, bringing dogs etc."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Alex Syragakis,0,Nice campground.  Hydro sites are large.  Comfort station is old and needs to be replaced. Somewhat noisey close to Hwy 60.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,manoj manoj,0,Feel little crowded but beautiful place.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"Mew Lake Campground did not disappoint! Being in the radio-free section made it easy to forget how close we were to the highway. Though the lake is small, it is wonderfully serene and quite close to several trails. Would definitely visit again, though ideally when the weather is warmer!"
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Joshua Kubinec,0,"Mew Lake is the classic mixed used front country campground.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,Try to get a campsite in the 93-97 sections on the lake for the best views and lots of privacy.  Despite it being in season camping time we were unable to get firewood anywhere but the front gates (despite signs indicating we should go ...
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Denny Hill,0,"This is worst camp ground I have seen in Ontario. Dirty and smelly washrooms. When I gave feedback to the camp office, they told me that it's luxury camping. If you don't like it, you can leave it any time.

Camp sites and Walkways camp sites are littered with garbage."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"It is right next to the washroom and the pond.  As others have mentioned, it is very close to the highway, so traffic noises should be expected.  The site is private, pretty large and can easily park 3 cars.  There are lots of good spots ..."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Alison Miller,0,"3 girlfriends and I wanted to winter camp in a yurt and dogsled. It was all better than we expected. The ""hosts"" on site were great to deal with.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Matt Pinder,0,Nice campsites with good lake access and decent privacy. Only drawback is that the highway is right across the lake and is fairly loud.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Mike Tennyson,0,Was told by the park help I had to wait until 8am to check out before I could leave as I arrived late. I had planned to be on the road by 6:30.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Shyla Tibando,0,This is a beautiful campground. We saw a family of ducks. My cousin saw a moose and another camper saw a beaver.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Emma Fisher-Cobb,0,"A great place for a winter getaway.  This campground has a warm comfort station,  gorgeous views, and a skating rink for lots of winter fun. We had a quiet spot without many campers around, but we could hear people across the lake. Come prepared with fire starters though because the wood from the park store is damp. "

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Nathan Snider,0,"Beautiful layout, easy to register and get into. No issues whatsoever."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Paul Mendes,0,Our favorite Algonquin camping site!. The dog and radio free area offers very secluded sites. Much quieter than the other nearby campgrounds. It is about 10 minutes by bike along a beautiful wooded trail to get to the main camp store. Mew lake has a nice beach area and access to the railway walking/cycling trail.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Jon Sund,0,Enjoyed the dog and radio free area with it's secluded sites. While the park has sites with electricity they are not within this area and are not nearly as secluded. If you can live without electricity and do not have pets this is great place to visit.
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Gavin Atkins,0,"Really nice camp sites on he water, but mine was too close to the highway so the road noise was a bit loud."
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,Mark Smith,0,Algonquin is a beautiful gem. Mew Lake is an excellent spot for car camping and has beautiful views. Only downfall is it is too close to highway 60'and there is road noise.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,Mew lake offers section w/o pets and radios with most of the sites right on the lake's shore. All these are nice and quiet with enough space between sites to have a feeling of privacy. The only drawback is that the common rooms (with showers) are quite far and you'll probably end up driving your car to get into shower :)

Bugs are bad but not the worst I've seen for this time of year. The beach is nice and we were able to get some great pics of some Canadian Geese with their babies.

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"We stayed for a week at Mew Lake camp ground.  It was at Kilometre 30 on Highway 60, so quite central to what the park had to offer. We had an enormous site in the electrical campground, very close to the comfort station (site 16) and ..."

Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,Found a cool site that shows campsite pictures of the park and many others.  Google mew Lake campsite pictures.  Much better than OP's offerings too||And don't mind the bear signs and traps.  Been to Algonquin a million times and haven't spotted a bear yet.  I think they just want you to keep your site clean||
Algonquin  Mew Lake Campground,TripAdvisor Reviewer,0,"I start with the fact that we have also very recently stayed at Achray Campground, Eastern Algonquin Park.||By comparison, Mew Lake is not the place to camp if you want an 'Algonquin Park' experience.||1.  It is too near the busy highway ..."
