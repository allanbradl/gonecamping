Fairbank Provincial Park,Joanne Eddy,5,"Wanted to share our experience at Fairbank Provincial Campground. We had a great time even though there was a fire ban on, and it rained off and on. Our experience was great because of one of the Park Attendants' - Julie!! She has a ..."
Fairbank Provincial Park,Nour El Shamy,4,"Great campground. Lots of seasonal RVs so most campgrounds are reserved with no occupants actually being there, so it's fairly empty and private. Showers, toilets, and laundry equipment are fairly dated and not super clean. The lake and ..."

Fairbank Provincial Park,Chaim,5,Best camping experience ever. Brought my dog and he was off leash and they didn't really care  you can rent canoes for 50 bucks a day and a 50 dollar deposit they also don't care about smoking which is awesome. Overall clean and comfy site with our own private beach
