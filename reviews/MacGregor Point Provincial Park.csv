MacGregor Point Provincial Park,Tara Kachroo,4,"A very large, clean and well kept park. The main activity is definitely biking and I wouldn't camp here without bringing a bike. Beaches are so so.

MacGregor Point Provincial Park,Mike Hilario,4,The place is nice and private at the camp ground beaches. There wasn't a lot of people when we went. Beach parking is a bit far. It's not right beside it. I truly enjoyed the mature trees and vegetation all around. Some of the paths are gravel instead of pavement which is really nice for walks!

MacGregor Point Provincial Park,bigred5050,4,"Nice campground. Washrooms well maintained. Decent trails to hike. Relatively quiet in the evening when we were there. 

Suprisingly no signage to the washrooms or outhouse, so it's quite easy to get lost to and from. Why they don't have signs is beyond me."
MacGregor Point Provincial Park,Jessica McEneaney,5,"Every time I've gone I've loved it. Have always stayed in the Huron section of the camp. Sometimes there are partyers on the Friday night but by Saturday night they're all exhausted. As a nice treat, it's a fun bike ride to the camp shop ..."
