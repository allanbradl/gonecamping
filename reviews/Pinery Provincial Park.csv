Pinery Provincial Park,Marissa Edwards,5,My family and I love it there! We go in a tent and we have a making time. The washrooms aren't a long walk. We saw some turkeys walking around. My family and I go to town and go to aunt gussied for break feast and go to sea jewels and go mini golfing and walk through the stores. Amazing campground.
Pinery Provincial Park,Danny Mazza,5,"The Pinery is the best provincial park in South Western Ontario, it has everything you need to enjoy a nature filled get away from the city. You don't have to pack any big sports gear because you  can rent canoes, paddle boats and ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Sherri Cooper,3,"Ok I am not a big fan of this park. It is big with lots to do. However the sites are small, I feel like your waking up to being on your neighbors site. If this was all that was available than I would go back, but there are definitely better parks in Ontario."
Pinery Provincial Park,Joe,2,"It’s a nice park. It would have been better if that Maynard guy wasn’t there trying to convince people that his grandfathers campfire story means the park is his but oh well, there’s always someone trying to get something for nothing. I’ll visit again for sure, when they get it all sorted and kick that guy out."
Pinery Provincial Park,Kristin Ippolito,4,"Loved the experience for renting canoe/kayaks, dog beach, biking around the wooded forest and the ice cream is delicious! It’s definitely car camping though and can be a bit crammed for my liking. We are more into backpacking and tried ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Conner Hein,5,"Too many memories too call this an unbiased review, but this place is amazing.  The environment, the trails, the sights, and the sounds of this park are amazing.  I can’t recommend this place any more.  The ultimate escape is just laying ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Jessica Williams,5,Such a beautiful amazing camping park. There aren’t many parks that have so many trees as Pinery! I am happy we got a site right beside the bathroom as some of the sites are really far from bathrooms. The bathrooms were really clean! We are going to go in the summer so we can check out the beach!
Pinery Provincial Park,Sajjan Aryal,4,"Excellent place for camping and activities. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. It was quite and natural. Biking trail is great. Beaches are serene, could be dangerous due to current. Loved the walk in the dunes."
Pinery Provincial Park,James Vrolyk,5,"Beautiful park on Lake Huron. Great big sandy beaches (some gravelly patches, but generally sandy). Campsites are private and comfortable. Comfort stations are well spaced and lots of things to do. Three different ecosystems throughout ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Mike Schmidt,4,"A big provincial park with huge beaches and pretty decent camp site sizes. Beautiful sunsets everyday, but one has to watch for poison ivy especially in the dark. Often had cell phone service throughout the park so was able to coordinate ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Prashant Chauhan,4,"Good clean campground, easy to access and use clean facilities. Lots of trails to hike but quite far from our campsite. There is bike rentals, canoe rental and good ice cream shop across the general store within the park in the center. ..."

Pinery Provincial Park,Gordon Ng,5,"What a fantastic place to camp and get away from the city.  Nestled on the shores of Lake Huron you can enjoy the clean waters of this secluded provincial park.  The first time we visited this park it had all beautiful sandy beaches, but ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Bob Bublic,5,"Probably our favourite Ontario park. Plenty to do for the kids, excellent beach, superb trails and lots of tree cover. Don't forget to visit the visitors centre. I was surprised to see it all refreshed. Last time we were there was in ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Stephany Amanda,5,"I've been coming here since I was a kid and I've always loved this place! The drive just going into the beach is stunning but the trails are just as gorgeous!
Love this beach and park!!! I"
Pinery Provincial Park,Maria GAHLINGER,5,"What a great park! The park is extensive, well forested and set along the eastern shore of Lake Huron. 
The campsites are attractive, large, private, and with many trees and bushes between the sites. I was in the ""Dunes"" area which is ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,EnvyMiA,5,"Great place, the camping grounds were clean and firewood provided (though you should bring your own)

Lots of benches for a group site, washrooms not too far and very well taken care of, and close enough to get to the beach, while being a short drive from the main grand bend strip. Will definitely be coming back"
Pinery Provincial Park,Saimah S,5,Love this place. It's perfect place for an escape. Huge park with lots of hiking tracks and various options for beaches. Love coming here for swimming and day trips. The water is cleaner than the main Beach in grandbend and not as ...

Pinery Provincial Park,Caroline Kelly,3,Yurt are beautiful and we'll taken care of but way to close together! They need more privacy!
Pinery Provincial Park,Ja Sch,5,Best beach in South Ontario.  Book in advance.  Fascinating nature centre.  Winter camping.  Cycling trails.  Beautiful.
Pinery Provincial Park,Gillian Elliott,5,2 words; the beach. Having the ability to go swim all day for $17 a car is absolutely worth it at this incredible provincial park. We were able to enjoy a busy beach that didn't feel crowded at all WITH OUR DOG!! The fact that they allow dogs on their amazing beach makes this my favourite beach in Southern Ontario.
Pinery Provincial Park,Chris Wickardt,5,Just as beautiful in the winter for walks as in the summer only quieter you almost have the place to yourself. Hikes and  cross-country skiing in the beautiful untouched snow covered forests.
Pinery Provincial Park,Jesse Eliasen,5,The pinery is a great place.I'm always confused every year if the natives of took it over or what cuz I'm always hearing that they have tooken it over.I lost my wallet here several years ago and it was returned to me with all my money in ...

Having said that, I would have given five stars for ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Craig Clinansmith,5,The family loves this place. Always a great time and they have spots in the winter for us hard core campers. Thanks.
Pinery Provincial Park,Mandi Oh Zee,5,Beautiful beach with tons of space. Campsites are huge and the water is so nice but some of the beaches have a lot of rocks. Make sure to grab an icecream on your way out.
Pinery Provincial Park,Rares Rus,4,"Always enjoyed camping here, not a fan of the rock beaches though."
Pinery Provincial Park,Pat Laforest,5,"Cool place, i only stayed one night but definitely need to go back, there's a network of small rivers that would be Great yo explore paddling and trails that would be great to walk or bike."
Pinery Provincial Park,Stuart Walter,4,Nice provincial park. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Beaches are nice. This is a very busy park. There are alot of sites so they are quite varied in privacy and size. Park layout is pretty confusing for a 1st timer and signage isn't the ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Autumn Wolf,5,We had a great stay here. The weather was rainy but we made the best out of it and it is a nice park. They were even really good about refunding our second night when we decided to pack up. I also came here to the beach a couple weeks ...

Pinery Provincial Park,Shari Heuston,4,We had a beautiful stay.  The weather was great and the ice cream was delicious. The only issue is when we arrived at the pinery. It took us an hour just to fill up with water. Because everybody is in the same line. People dumping and ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Matt Mikolajczyk,5,"One of my favourite parks in Ontario. There are other ones that are amazing but I just love The Pinery. It is excellent for biking, great ice cream place, the dunes are amazing and superb beach... Of  course it's different from Algonquin or Killarney but it has its own beauty and it is one of my top ones!!!"
Pinery Provincial Park,Julie Bedard,5,Always love the Pinery ....spring fall ams winter when it's not too busy !
Pinery Provincial Park,Thomas Brown,4,"Quiet at this time of the year. Great place for a walk in the woods, and a snack by the shoreline."
Pinery Provincial Park,SpI77E D,4,"Overall the experience at Pinery Provincial Park was good. The only problem was that the smaller washrooms did not have any light in the washroom, thus making it really hard to use it at night time. Also please keep the washroom clean ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Sophia Popova,5,"AMAZING place!!! We go every summer with our family friends.

The dunes are definitely the gem of the place as well as the incredible sunsets in the quiet evenings. They also have a cool community center and a variety of outdoor sports. Overall, a great place to spend the summer away from the city."
Pinery Provincial Park,Kait Stamcos,5,One of our favourite places to go every year! Really gorgeous sites and amazing beaches.
Pinery Provincial Park,Szymon Buhajczuk,5,"What a amazing place to take the family. Biking trails, amazing ""sea like"" Beach, canoe /bike rentals. Comfort stations with showers everywhere. Even their ""outhouses"" have flush toilets. Quite up scale for camping."
Pinery Provincial Park,Roshan Shah,3,Great  park.  Was searching for open ground to play Cricket but couldn't find one. Beach was excellent although there was challenge  in finding parking at beach and that Enforcement officers were not patrolling Beach parking spots ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Stewart Kelly,4,"Pretty special place to visit- great scenery lots to do for the kids great beach and trails too. 

Only down side is the behaviour of some people who visit the park.  Littering drinking on the beach.  Last visit had a bunch of kids ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Corey Morrison,5,The largest park in Ontario. Check out the weekly events. We loved the nature walk at night
Pinery Provincial Park,Jason Vander Meulen,5,"This is the premiere family camping in Southwestern Ontario. It's great car camping with lots of trails and for hiking and biking.
But, by far, the beaches on Lake Huron are the draw here. If you can, make the trek to the day beaches on ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,knockali,5,New yurts were amazing.  You can now see the stars from your bed.
Pinery Provincial Park,Jenna R,4,"Was here on Wednesday.  Was there in the morning with my mom, sister and dog for canoeing.  My mom and I had taken our dog canoeing last year in September and she was good with it so we decided to do it again.  We had to buy a day pass ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,zarka101,5,One of the best parks to go camping. The dunes campgrounds are great and in close proximity to the lake and river. Plenty of activities to keep you busy. They also have canoe/kayak rentals. Lots of trails to go exploring and overall great atmosphere
Pinery Provincial Park,Chris Dobson,3,"It's alright but not my favourite park. Nice long trails for biking. Nice river for fishing. Beaches at dunes are pretty good. 

Always busy. 
I get poison ivy every year I go.
 It's everywhere. Stay away from the brush around your site. ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Jay Brodie,5,"Great park, well maintained. Sites are slightly close to each other, some have more space and trees between them than other. The beach is great, once you get past the rocks on the way in. But that is indicative of that lake. Comfort stations and bathrooms are updated and clean."
Pinery Provincial Park,Amy Olatan,3,The beach area was crowded. Me and my friends wanted to stay on a shaded area nearest to the path to our campsite but other people who were in that area told us we couldn't because there was a lot of us. We had children who needed the ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Steve McCarthy,5,One of the nicest parks you could visit. Plenty of activities to keep busy with.
Pinery Provincial Park,Trish Thompson,5,"Great campground with lots to do like fishing, swimming in the lake, canoeing, kayaking, trail walking."
Pinery Provincial Park,Richy Noronha,4,Went to the dog friendly beach section and had an awesome time. The sun wasn't too harsh so the water was a bit cold..many pebbles at the shoreline made it painful to get into the water though. Washrooms had several tiny flies. Overall a beautiful breathtaking place!
Pinery Provincial Park,Daniel Thrasher,4,Fantastic time.... except for the little wood roaches... We didn't have any come home with us but I also think they probably want to stay there... They have a pretty sweet set-up.
Pinery Provincial Park,Christine McCullough,5,"This is one of my favourite places! It's a fairly large park and covers a lot of different terrain.  While the beaches (of which there are both very accessible beaches and more remote, private beaches) are probably the biggest draw, ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Gwenevere C,5,"The Pinery is gorgeous!! There is a ton of flora and fauna here, especially all the beautiful birds to be seen! The boardwalk to the beach offered a spectacular view, and the trails were a lot of fun to walk along. Be prepared for a) ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,House of beng beng blog,5,"We went last week for 5 days, it was great. This provincial park is officially my favorite park. It’s summer so it was busy, lots of people for a weekday but this park feels like you have your own world. The beach is so long that even if ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Jude Freeborough,5,"Always a great stay at Pinery. Dunes #4 was quiet and sites clean and spacious.
Bike rides and kayaking and hiking... beautiful sunset."
Pinery Provincial Park,Chris Meunier,5,This park is great for car camping. It is easily accessible and full of comfort stations. The beach is super long and the sand dunes (a rare ecosystem in Ontario) are stunning. Then only thing more stunning in this park are the sun sets. This park is a must visit!
Pinery Provincial Park,Neil Fernandes,5,"Large Provincial Park in Granf Bend. The park has campgrounds spread over different wooded areas. Clean washrooms and showers, an amphitheatre, visitors centre, trails, bird watching, camp store, kayak and bike rentals make this a very ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Jennifer Daniells,5,"Had an amazing time! I wish I could post pictures, but I was living more in the moment and decided to let my phone die instead. Sounds archaic, but it was actually really nice not to feel reliant on technology. We were at Riverside at ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Maria Gahlinger,5,"It's a beautiful park on Lake Huron with large and fairly private campsites. The public washrooms and showers were clean and easily accessible. The staff helpful and friendly. It's a very popular park so reservations are a good idea, particularly on week ends."
Pinery Provincial Park,Pat Jeppesen,4,What a beautiful place. The yurts are larger then the yurts at MacGregor. One concern is the state of the washrooms at the end of the weekend.
Pinery Provincial Park,Callie Sweet,5,"The Pinery is a lovely place to spend the summer. My family and I are going up for a few weeks, and we are looking forward to having an enjoyable stay. Some things that appeal to us particularly are the many beaches and fun activities to ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Tulsi Pandya,5,Amazing park to go camping! I stayed in the Burley camp grounds and my site was super close to the beach. The beach had a brilliant view of the sunset and sunrise. I would recommend taking your car and parking near the beach as walking a ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Simon Lammers,3,"Beautiful park, very busy and because the park is popular, your neighbours may not be the greatest. Customer experience may vary"
Pinery Provincial Park,Jonathan Lees,5,"The Pinery is a fantastic park. Everyone that I've spoken to has the same experience: Terrific!

The washrooms are clean, the staff are friendly, the park store area is HUGE with tons of options (from bike rentals to boat rentals to ice ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Ian Rupar,5,Had a great time despite it pouring rain when we first arrived. Stayed at a site in Dunes 3. The site was spacious and private. It had a campfire ring and a picnic table. Everything was in good condition. The beach was less than five minute walk away. Would recommend as a good getaway for a weekend.
Pinery Provincial Park,T Hutch,4,Everything is very used and could use updating but we enjoyed our stay.
Pinery Provincial Park,Melanie VanDyke,5,Beautiful huge park with really nice campsites. Lake huron beach is a little rocky but nice clean water to swim in.
Pinery Provincial Park,Cal Barnes,5,A great place to camp and swim. If you are staying in Riverside you will need a car or bike to get to the beach (it is a bit of a haul). This place is a nice place to spend time with good people. Out of the provincial parks in Ontario this is one of the nicer ones.
Pinery Provincial Park,Gamal Tawaf,5,"One of the best beaches I have been to.
10K beach and everything was clean and awesome.

Highly recommend"
Pinery Provincial Park,Fernando Torres,4,"It's a very nice place. One of the biggest in North America as I read. It has forest and lake.
 I could see that the camping lots are very close to each other though. 
The signs could also be better, it wasn't easy to find some of the ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,David Boulos,5,"This is a beautiful provincial park with many facilities available on site. There is a campsite which has electricity available, along with showers and bathrooms. This park is about a ten minute drive from Grand Bend Beach, which is a very good location."
Pinery Provincial Park,Jessica Sims,5,"Washrooms are kept clean, staff are always around cleaning and the beach is amazing. The province does a great job up-keeping this property and keeping it very natural. Great for campers, and even for just a day."
Pinery Provincial Park,Keith Kelly,3,"Highly disappointed. First campground,  EVER, that we have been denied access to view campsites so we could plan an upcoming camping trip.  Wanted to charge us $17 just to take a quick look. The area itself looks awesome and inviting, so we can't give nature a bad review, just the rangers."
Pinery Provincial Park,Keyvan G,5,Well maintained and one of the best in Ontario for biking. Beautiful beach and trails. Don't forget the ice cream shop!!! Park store has pretty much everything you may need or forget to bring for your camp.
Pinery Provincial Park,Glenn Soltes,5,"Pretty much the best park in Southern Ontario....

After 30 years of tolerating poorly designed, old and impossible to clean comfort stations..... comfort station #5 in Dunes is a prime example of a logical, comfortable and green design..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Mallory Risto,5,"One of the most beautiful Provincial park there is an all of Ontario, the forest looks like something out of a fairy tale and the park has a great amount of space to always feel very in nature. BBQs and picnic tables are usually provided ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Vasco Nunes,5,"Awesome place, clear water at the beach, great temperature as well. The Park is big, well preserved, worth going back. Lots of space for camping, walking or biking on the trails. Boat and bike rentals, and also some food options in the central visitors center."
Pinery Provincial Park,Chris P,1,Great place but infested with ticks. 5 out of 8 of us got bit over the weekend and one person was infected with Lyme disease. Be aware!
Pinery Provincial Park,teiuriz,4,"Very nice park. Lots of hiking and great beach, looks like the ocean. Some canoeing but really limited to the 5 km in the park unless you go out onto lake huron"
Pinery Provincial Park,Linda Rose,5,Great dog beach. Sites aren't huge but turquoise Lake Huron and the sunsets more than make up for it. Kids love the ice cream shop and the store is large and convenient.
Pinery Provincial Park,Tyler Poirier,5,"Extremely scenic and less busy than Grand Bend. The day use fee is about the same as you would pay to get parking in Grand Bend, and it is much more private. The first four feet of water has rocks, but it is all sand the rest of the way. ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,jason z,5,"It is very nice place for family with kids, we go there almost every summer."
Pinery Provincial Park,Natali Yakeemovich,5,"Great Park! Coming here with kids for sixteen years! The park is very well maintained. Each day there are interesting educational programs for kids of any age. Thanks, Pinary, for the amazing time!"
Pinery Provincial Park,Robert Bailey,4,Wonderful place to spend a day with the family. Lots of great outdoor opticians and good camp grounds.
Pinery Provincial Park,Ben DSa,4,"I love Grand Bend, the beach is beautiful. The park is always clean and the flusable toilets at the beach are a bonus.  Would definitely recommend the yurts, they are very spacious and clean.  Great staff, always friendly and helpful.  Also the restaurant and ice cream store are a big bonus."
Pinery Provincial Park,Ken Hopkins,5,Great place to get away from it all. Even if its just for a day
Pinery Provincial Park,Paul Jefferson,4,Great clean sites.  Clean facilities.  Great beach! Loved our weekend visit!
Pinery Provincial Park,Gazelle Manavipour,4,"This is one the best campsites that I have been in Ontario.  It's a big park. No mosquitoes.  But lots of flies and lots of lots of sand roaches. I was very worried to bring them home but apparently they do not live out of wild life. 
Beach is a sandy one but also lots of rocks."
Pinery Provincial Park,Clara Hill,5,Love the Pinery! It's small compared to other parks but always well kept. We camp here at least once a season ans visit with a day pass a couple times a year.
Pinery Provincial Park,Chiya Haji,1,The park ranger who goes by the name b. Lane was very confrontational and looks to be racist. My friends say they call this place finery provincial park because they seem to fine you all the time and we witnessed that and now know why. ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Mista Jay,5,"Always enjoy The Pinery Provincial Park.  Great spot for camping, whether in a tent or trailer they have sites that are secluded or open depending on your preference. 
This park boasts an amazing beach that stretches for miles so there's ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Frank Whitestone,5,"Amazing place for camping during long weekends, one of my favourite provincial parks. Make sure you book ahead as it books up months in advance!"
Pinery Provincial Park,Tricia Laughlin,5,Loved this place. Lots of rentals for canoes for paddle boats. Great prices.  Lots of beaches a d dog friendly beaches.  Really enjoyed the day here.
Pinery Provincial Park,Lidia,4,"Actually, I give it 4.5 stars:
5 stars for the campgrounds. We stayed at Burley, the furthest one from the park office. The sites are capacious, each with a picnic bench and a fire pit. Plenty of very clean washrooms with toilets and ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,DJ M,3,Washroom is not much clean. Beautiful views
Pinery Provincial Park,Megan Radigan,5,"Love the Pinery! Hiking, canoeing, fishing, swimming beach days etc. Plus all the programming they have available - what isn't to like???! The kids had a blast, and the sandy soil makes for dry campsites when it rains! Just need to be careful to avoid the poison ivy!"
Pinery Provincial Park,Jaclyn van Barneveld,3,Great sites for a provincial park..Thanksgiving weekend we ended up have a lot more privacy but a full campground would mean less privacy..that being said site 243 we stayed at is as private you can get in a provincial park campground.
Pinery Provincial Park,Stacey McLeod,5,"Great time!  I love all the extra activities for kids, even in the rain I didn't hear ""I'm bored"".  Great sites and friendly staff.  Definitely recommend."
Pinery Provincial Park,SE YOUNG KIM,5,One of the most beautiful provincial park in Ontario.
Pinery Provincial Park,Ryan Trim,5,"Absolutely hands down a must for anyone into camping.  If you can get a site in the dunes you're set.  Quick walk to the beach and unbelievable swimming for kids.  Just watch out for rhe coons, had one sitting beside me when I started composing this review (no joke lol)"
Pinery Provincial Park,Grégoire Lamarche Ledoux,4,Surprisingly there were no mosquitoes when we camped. Had a nice little trail behind campsite that lead to the dunes and an isolated but fairly rocky beach. Daytime beach was sandy. We went there on a very windy day and had a great old time in the sea-like waves.
Pinery Provincial Park,Brad D,5,This is a park that you need more than a weekend to explore.  Its massive and beautiful.   Be cautious if hauling a camper bc some of the corners are tight and we got wedged between two trees ripping off our awning.
Pinery Provincial Park,drahl649,4,"Probably one of the best stocked parks out there, however it's always packed in the summer so if you're looking for a quiet getaway this won't be the place for you.  Dog friendly on day beach two is always a hit for me."
Pinery Provincial Park,Mohsen Z,4,"I love pinery provincial park. My third time here and I like it even more than before. It has all you want in a park: river, beach, bike, canoe, ... Rental and nice trails. It has s close to great bend where you can find good ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Pamela Schreiner,5,It's so great that they have a beach where you can swim with your dog. And the kids had a lot of fun jumping and rolling around on the massive sand dunes by the dunes camping area.
Pinery Provincial Park,Adam Werstine,4,Nice park but has become jammed with people.
Pinery Provincial Park,Renata R,5,"Year after year our favorite! 
Love the campsites at Dunes 1and 2.
Nice, large and private. 
The comfortstations are clean and well set up.
Awesome beach, trails, river and oportunities for kids to explore nature."
Pinery Provincial Park,Becky Matson,4,"I know it was late in the season (Oct) but I wish the shop was still open. Otherwise, always a great stay at the pinery."
Pinery Provincial Park,Ryan Talbot,5,Love love love this park. Feel blessed it's so close to home!
Pinery Provincial Park,Lisa Gordon,5,Magical place to camp and beautiful place to hike. We plan on canoeing on our next trip there in the early Fall. Our campsite was spacious and privacy was good. All sites come with a fire pit with grill. Plenty of hardwood firewood and ...
Pinery Provincial Park,Maryann Vanderloo,2,"We have come here all of our lives. Lots of camping and just beach days. We have never had a problem with cockroaches, until this year! They were everywhere in all of the campgrounds and even at the ice cream picnic tables! I feel bad ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Olivia Cicha,4,"We love camping here. All the facilities you may need are available (toilets, hot showers, laundry, etc). Lake Huron is beautiful!"
Pinery Provincial Park,Barry O'Sullivan,4,"Fantastic place and staff very professionally run, lovely campsites and Canoe & Kayaks rental, for those hanging tarps over tents to keep cool and dry, the trees can be well spread out so bring 100ft of rope per tarp to tie off the 4 ends, each of the fire pits also has a flip over grate for cooking which is handy"
Pinery Provincial Park,Talha S,4,"Clean park with clean water by the lake. BBQ facility available, in the great outdoors. 10 km of greenery. Perfect for a family weekend"
Pinery Provincial Park,Tim Bowes,2,"Stayed 4 days at Riverside campground @ Pinery. Sites were very small and right next to the roadways. Washrooms were not kept very clean or stocked. Yellow cockroaches everywhere and i mean everywhere, into everything. Only positives are ..."
Pinery Provincial Park,Rohit Kadam,5,"This park has everything. Camping, Canoeing, Bicycling, Trails, Beach, Great Lake. Grand Bend is only 15 mins away where lot of water sport activities are available and decent restaurants as well."
Pinery Provincial Park,Dawn Brasil,5,"Always a great place to camp or RV, great sites, lots to see and do and clean facilities."
Pinery Provincial Park,Oleg Petrenko,2,Was not good and relaxing this time. The site with 10 young punks was so loud. Kept all 6 kids up till 2 am. Reported to pinery staff. They kind of said would take care of it. Hardly believe they fined them for that noise complains. Wish it would be taken better for convinient stay of all families. 👎
Pinery Provincial Park,Prince Philip,4,"If your wallet is holding you from the beaches of the Caribbean, then i should say we can still settle with Pinery Provincial Park  
The waters are warm n peaceful crowd surrounding you. There is a special beach for family with pets. Beaches are narrow depending upon the tides. Bring your umbrella."
Pinery Provincial Park,Johnny Seguin,5,Great place to come and unwind. Hit the beach or kayak the river or hike one of many trails or relax at camp. Pinary has everything an outdoor enthusiast would love.
Pinery Provincial Park,mike budny,5,"I always enjoy coming here. Great walking trails and good camp sites. Great family camping as well with wood trucks that drive back to sell to you if you need more. Bathroom and showers close at hand. 
They have decent sound limits at night to accomodate other campers. Overall it is a clean fun campsite close to Grandbend."
Pinery Provincial Park,Julie Nethercott,5,Always a great place to experience nature anytime of the year
Pinery Provincial Park,Jodi O.,4,Great place to camp. Lots of things to do. I only wish they enforced the dog on leash rule. Several times I was going for a walk with my kids and our dog and an unleashed dog rushed out from a campsite.
Pinery Provincial Park,Jeremy Blair,5,Love this campground. Spent another Thanksgiving and wouldn't want to spend it anywhere else
Pinery Provincial Park,Amanda Norton,4,"Fun camp ground. Biggest downside is one that probably can't be helped, but it is the poison ivy. Every time we go, all of my kids get it and it has to be treated."
Pinery Provincial Park,Scott Sharron,4,"We love to camp here a couple times each year.  Great family trips.  Bike, beach, canoe, fish, no playground equip for the kiddos though."
Pinery Provincial Park,hitendra mahida,5,"Clean water, levelled surface which is safe for kids, less bugs, rocks and people which make your experience far superior compared to other crowded beach. Entry fee is $17, you will be surprised to drive 13-14 Kms to get and out of park. So big and lots of things to do."
Pinery Provincial Park,Yeshua Ja,5,"It's a beautiful park with lots to do. Miles of hiking and biking, gorgeous visitor's centre, a restaurant, fantastic camp sites, tons of beaches. The only downside is the beaches are much more rocky now compared to several years ago, wear sandals."
Pinery Provincial Park,Tom Yates,5,Wonderful park that has gotten far too busy.
Pinery Provincial Park,Karen Carter,5,One of our favourite places close to home. Never changes. Natural beauty.

Pinery Provincial Park,Donald Keay,3,"Location and facilities are great, the services such as canoe rentals are still as good as ever, however it does get very busy here, the day use beaches (on the long weekend especially) get super packed."
Pinery Provincial Park,Racey T,5,Beautiful! Nice camp sites and gorgeous beach. Some ants and poison ivy but still worth going

Pinery Provincial Park,Lee Kirkby,4,It's been hot but good. Only complaint is the shut down of things like the visitor centre during the week. Same thing in Bon Echo on June. Even shorter hours would ok but just because we are in the park mid week doesn't mean that everything should start shutting down.

Love the hiking trails and the bike rides. The beach is good, and the water goes shallow for a long distance, very safe for kids to play."
Pinery Provincial Park,A. Rose,4,"Great little dog beach. However, the dog beach is only marked on the map. It is the first parking lot for beaches you come across, and since there are no signs, sometimes families unwittingly go into the dog beach and get mad at dog owners. It would be beneficial to post actual signs, I think."

Pinery Provincial Park,Catherine Stephen,5,"Best park ever!  I used to backcountry camp when I was younger and so I was quite snobbish about the whole camping experience.  Now that I'm older and have a teenaged son and a travel trailer, the Pinery is like the Bahamas in Ontario to ..."

Pinery Provincial Park,Randy Marion,5,"This campground is fantastic. Everything you need is available. Hiking. Canoe or kayaking. Right on Lake Huron, which to me, has magical properties in it. It makes you young again. Once you step in, you feel like a kid. "

Pinery Provincial Park,Rick Erdelac,4,Small sites and tons of poison ivy

Pinery Provincial Park,Gary Bryce,5,Sites are big and clean

Pinery Provincial Park,Kriselle,5,"Favourite place to go camping around Ontario. Clean campsite, clean washrooms and the beach was beautiful."
Pinery Provincial Park,Steve Lozanov,5,Go to the park and camp. Take your kids with you and let them be closer to nature. Do the trails on foot or bike. Kayaking is also must.

Pinery Provincial Park,Peter Iversen,5,I trust our Government will take a firm hand to keep this park open to the general public and not let a few blackmail them into giving it up.  This seems to be a slippery slope where expectations continually increase as our government just throws dollars at the situation.  Case in point Caledonia.
Pinery Provincial Park,Stefan Hosko,5,Got poison ivy... still had fun
Pinery Provincial Park,Merlissa Mathurin,5,"This place was chosen as my 2017 girl camping trip and we were all so happy that it was.
