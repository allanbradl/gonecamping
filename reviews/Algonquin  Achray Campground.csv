Algonquin  Achray Campground,Allan Bassi,5,"Definitely stop in here and buy a souvenir, some firewood, or a well-earned popsicle after days out in the woods.

The folks working here are knowledgeable and kind.  We came in for directions to a jump-off point that we saw on the map. ..."
Algonquin  Achray Campground,David Bonany,5,This is by far our favourite destination after 18 years of paddling together.  Short trip over to Stratton Lake and you have access to amazing campsites on the south shore.  Just around the corner is a perfect day trip to High falls.

Algonquin  Achray Campground,Al Lockley,4,Nice wilderness experience for very little expense.  Lots of Loons to listen to (the bird type not the people type.)  At least not this week.  Mostly families.
Algonquin  Achray Campground,Konrad Wojcik,5,"Best Campground in Algonquin

This is my favourite spot in Algonquin for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is simply stunning. The views off the lake are to die for. The campground is basically full all summer long. You have to book sites ..."
Algonquin  Achray Campground,Waltz,5,Achray has great starting points for backcountry camping. We camped at Stratton Lake and it was beautiful (if you can get past the swarm of mosquitoes). The sites also have a line to hang your bear bag and some even come equipped with seating areas made out of logs or rocks.
Algonquin  Achray Campground,Kevin Ryckman,5,What a great spot!
Algonquin  Achray Campground,B Inthavong,4,"Beautiful area, very different from the south and west side of the park! Not as busy, though I find that often times campers let their dogs run loose through the camp groups. Great launch off point for portages but also lots of hiking around the area. Shallow water."
