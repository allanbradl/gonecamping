French River Provincial Park,Sherif Ahmed,5,Stunning northern Ontario....
French River Provincial Park,Jenny Lam,5,Beautiful park with nice welcome centre and waterways. We were here for a canoe trip on the delta and I would recommend staying off the largest tributaries of the river. Although it was really lovely there is a huge amount of motorboat traffic on the main river that detracted from the entire experience.

French River Provincial Park,Smita Gohel,5,This park's is different from other landscapes. It's a 4 hour drive from Toronto but it's worth travelling. If you do not a water vehicle then you cannot camp. This place was found by the natives and there are so many beautiful birds to see. Just be aware of the snakes. 
French River Provincial Park,Dirk Townsend,5,Beautiful getaway for a backcountry canoe expedition.  We were lucky with 20 deg weather over the thanksgiving weekend.  Kids were swimming off the canoe several times per day.  Bring a map.
French River Provincial Park,Andrew de Boer,4,Neat little museum with some information on the history of the French River and it's importance in historical trade. Good information but not a lot of exhibits. And take a trip to the largest snowmobile bridge while you're there. Well worth it. 
French River Provincial Park,Naj H,5,"Just one hour north of Killbear. If you have a day to spare, go for an all day canoe trip here (bring your own canoe or rent from the nearby Supply Store). Apparently some of the best fishing grounds are here. "
French River Provincial Park,Terry Barrett,5,We have had many years of great outings in this area and recently were in great hands when Assistant Park Superintendent Ed Chevrette saved the day for us. We hit a rock far off the beaten path and he was so kind to help us back safely! Much appreciated!

French River Provincial Park,Ben Repa,5,"Good fishing, beautiful scenery."
French River Provincial Park,Jason Fowler,4,Lots of channels to explore in the lower delta!  Don't care for the amount of fishing motor boats and the fact that there is practically no free parking and will get gouged for parking and 'boat launch' fees for your canoe.  Some ...

French River Provincial Park,Dan Pronovost,3,"Not the same for back country canoeing as Killarney or Algonquin: you cannot reserve a specific site or lake, and the cost is as much and more with parking which is not included. On holidays, you can be travelling a long way to find an ..."
