Algonquin  Coon Lake Campground,Jamie Hofland,5,"Nice campground in algonquin park. Its a small lake with no motorized boats and only about 40 campsites tents only. Great for small children as they can ride bikes, swim and 0lay with next to no traffic."
Algonquin  Coon Lake Campground,Jade Goodwin,5,"Not very private for the campsite, but most days we got the lake entirely to ourselves. Since no motor boats are allowed on it it was very nice for canoeing. My friend and I canoed straight into the middle of the lake a few times and it was absolutely gorgeous being on the lake alone, surrounded by nature."
