The staff where very ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,House of beng beng blog,3,The drive to get there isn‚Äôt that long compared to other provincial parks.  It is a nice place to camp. Well maintained. Dog beach is very nice but small. If you have a dog and you come in late on a sunny day you will have a tough time ...
Awenda Provincial Park,Trev 2G,5,Definitely a place you should check out.  Beautiful beach!  Friendly staff when you register.  Easy to park.  Make sure you grab a map before you enter.  It can be a bit confusing if it's your first time.  Great for family & friends. ...
Awenda Provincial Park,Jessica Frias,4,"This is a gorgeous provincial park, not too far from the city and a wonderful quiet getaway. The only draw back for me is that the beaches are mostly natural and so not that sandy, with the nicest ones being quite a walk (since you can‚Äôt ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,P,5,"Lovely beach, gets lovelier the harder you work for it. Facilities are well maintained and the showers are fantastic. Park is very well kept. Even after four days of heavy rain, this park is a gem."
Awenda Provincial Park,Michelle Chang,4,Got a site at the bear campgrounds here and it was very close to the comfort station which was cleaned frequently and stocked with toilet paper. Camp grounds were a bit small though lots of privacy from other campsites. Garbage was also ...
Awenda Provincial Park,Ian Matchett,5,"Went in the middle of the week, camped for a night with family. Wonderful camp ground. Clean, big, tons of privacy.  Dog beach was small but we really enjoyed the space, went with a newborn, toddler and a dog and had a great stay. I could see how on a weekend space may be limited. Will definitely go again."
Awenda Provincial Park,Farzad Ali,5,"Went camping for the weekend here, it was an awesome quiet place, lots of trails to hike, things to do, theirs a beach, boat/canoe rentals nearby, they have firewood and all, campsites were good, showers had hot water which was a plus"
Awenda Provincial Park,Michael,5,"Awenda has a great beach. Clean sand and warm water. Kettle lake for canoe rental is beautiful, but relatively small. Rental facility is on opposite side of park from the lake and canoes so be prepared to wait for previous renters to ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,Pete Moss,4,"A great place to go for a weekend away, not too far from the Golden Horseshoe.  A very clean park, very private large sites and beautiful trails for hiking. The beach was a bit of a hike from the parking area, but well worth the walk. ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,Azzzfu,4,Busy.. but beautiful beaches.  Used to be my favorite park.  üëç
Awenda Provincial Park,Jessica Whiteman,5,"First time here with my family and we loved it! The camp sites are very nice, far enough away from your neighbours for some privacy, lots of tree coverage. 
The trails are nice (but beware the poison ivy) the beach was great... If you ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,Tommy Gunn,5,"This park is by far our favorite. Been here twice with my wife as new campers and fell in love with everything about it. Beautiful foliage with an intriguing history dating back to the ice age, nice simple trails, a beach and friendly ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,corinne lane,5,Our new favorite campground. Beaches are beautiful. The sites are big. Lots of tall trees around your site so privacy is decent. Will def be going back.
Awenda Provincial Park,Mark Fry,4,Clean showers and bathrooms. Fairly large and private sites. Good services with fair pricing. Park is fairly large and spread out so there is a bit of driving  to reach them.
Awenda Provincial Park,Solange Walinga,5,"Awenda P. P is awesome.  I have had the pleasure of camping in Awenda for almost 20yrs.  The trails are great, canoeing on Kettle Lake is great and spending a day at one of the beaches is great. My favourite Provincial Park!"
Awenda Provincial Park,Mary Jane Dempsey,5,Beautiful big and private sites. Clean and park guides were very helpful and attentive.
Awenda Provincial Park,Jeremy Irwin,3,"Great place for the beach and some hiking. But stay out of snake campground unless you are.....well how can I say, the kind of people that go to bed at 9:30 on Saturday. Expectation is for dead silence once it's dark and rangers are very uptight. I will come here again but not in snake campground."
Awenda Provincial Park,aRagingCanadian,5,Hands down one of the best parks we've been to. The sites are huge (we were camping in the Wolf campground). The comfort stations (bathrooms) are very very clear. Nearly every site is full of tree which gives you shade. The park store is ...

Awenda Provincial Park,Bruce Lee,4,Landscape and camping sites are great but needs proper visitor's/interpretive center. Building facilities are lacking.

Awenda Provincial Park,Doubleo Explorers,5,Great park!! Love the beaches!! The sites are also really big and clean
Awenda Provincial Park,Marijana Vasiljevic,1,"The beach is disgusting. The worst part of it are the washrooms. A bucket in a dark room with no sink. For a park that charges $15 to enter, you‚Äôd think they would at least provide a proper washroom. Waste of money. Never going there ..."

Georgian Bay is ..."
Awenda Provincial Park,Vincent Mok,4,Came here in winter. Bumped into another local who mentioned the trails were the worst (in terms of snow covered) he had seen in 10 years. I still enjoyed my walk however and the picture taken next to the frozen beach was pretty cool (it was eerily quiet)

Awenda Provincial Park,Nathan Maharaj,5,Underrated for trail running! Those celebrated cross-country skiing trails are perfect for easy-moderate trail running. The Bluff trail takes you in a complete 10k loop around the park and can be accessed from any campground. Signage ...
Awenda Provincial Park,Sara Cossitt,4,Great park for families. Awesome trails to hike and four beaches to use. Camp sites have a lot of space between each other and are filled with trees as long as you pick the non-electrical sites. Our dog loved the trails and the pet ...

Awenda Provincial Park,Howard Lenos,5,Scenic park with lots of trails. Large campsites. Requires a vehicle or bike to get to the beach.
Awenda Provincial Park,Maggie Zhang,1,"We booked two night group camping. The day when we arrived, it was pouring for hours. There is a path between the group site campground and the parking area. There is a gate to block the entrance so people had to carry everything( food, ..."
