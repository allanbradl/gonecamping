Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Denis Drainville,5,"Awesome park, clean and very friendly staff. My wife and I spent 4 days and it was totally worth it. Great kayaking opportunities at the park or nearby on Lake Superior. Highly recommended"
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Bludiamond59,5,I am bicycle touring around Lake Superior.  Rainbow Falls Provincial Park was a very nice stop for the night along the lake. I had a nice stop to hang a hammock and the attendant let charge my electronics in the shack . Very well taken care of.
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Nathalie Holler,5,Beautiful falls and a great provincial park. Great camping facilities too
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Bill Ducat,5,Great place to hang out and stop moving! Check out the falls and find the Red Chairs!
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Greg Stewart,4,The park was breathtaking.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Fire pit was full of toilet paper and soup cans tinfoil etc. After we cleaned it up we had one of.the best evenings on our holiday.
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Steven Clarke,3,Not up to the great standards of other provincial parks. The self registration desk lacked maps and pencils that others had. The comfort station was poorly maintained and more cramped than others and we found even the campsites poorly ...

Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Cristina Lovett,5,A very  nice campground will stay again
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Jennifer Wilson,4,"Rainbow Falls is pretty and can be viewed from many spots along a nice boardwalk trail with steps. Rossport campground had a lot of bugs in June, and it is very near a railroad track with heavy traffic."
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Geoff Rice,4,"Very nice Provincial Park campground. It was a bit more open than most we have seen on our trip, but they had power and water hookup for our Motorhome. The views were spectacular, but that seems par for the course anywhere along Lake ..."
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Mark Anderson,5,The campsites on Whitesand lake are nice for tent camping. I didn‚Äôt notice road noise at the campsite. The staff were friendly and generous with information about the park and surrounding area. The trail along the Whitesand river is very scenic with several beautiful cascades and waterfalls.
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Sandra Predinchuk,5,Great place to relax and rejuvenate.  Great swimming in Lake Superior.  Loved our stay. Lots of room on each lot. A bit confusing when you first enter to find the water fill up station. Wish they had full services but washroom and showers were very clean and so was the csmpground.

Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Eric Fletcher,4,"Small, and quieter than we expected being close to the highway. The beach is mostly round gravel, but there are some gorgeous glacier-smoothed rocks on the west side (site #19). You can easily swim to the small island to the east."
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Rene Doucette,5,Beautiful quiet clean
Rainbow Falls Provincial Park,Christopher Heim,4,"Stayed at Rossport Campground and was lucky enough to have a lake front spot.  Could not be beat.  If there's one complaint, it would be highway noise."
