Komoka Provincial Park,Austin Hurley,4,"As someone from northern Ontario this trail isn’t amazing, although a great place for a leisurely walk there is no challenge here. The park is very well maintained, unfortunately people still leave garbage about. The trail head does have ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,bri daisy,4,Great place to take a hike and clear your head.  The trails are will maintained and clean.  The variety of terrain as well as the different trail skill levels make it so you want to hike more and more!
Komoka Provincial Park,Gerald Holland,5,"We love hiking here. Parking is now paid, which is $5.25 for 2 hours, as a minimum, however, the trails are great, and scenic. Great place for a family walk or a date, and just minutes from the city"
Komoka Provincial Park,Shanti Nahata,4,"Great place for a hike. I like the different terrain the trails take. Flat and open, up hill, down hill, rocky , roots sticking out, canopy, big trees, river.
Quite and pristine. This is definitely worth a visit, if you like hiking and ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Heather Cabral,4,"Even on a cold fall day this provincial park is magical. Set along the Thames River, there are beautiful look outs, wildlife, and a multitude of paths. 

Only downside.. there is a fee for admission."
Komoka Provincial Park,Thor Sorensen,5,Saw Two Bald Eagles circling an hour ago it was fantastic.
Komoka Provincial Park,Matt Scarpz,5,Excellent park with lots of parking. Long calm relaxing scenic walks in your choice of 3 directs. Lots of animals & birds. Takes you right to the Thames river. There's a nice lookout spot in the winter & spring/fall without leaves that lets you see the horizon from a good height. I’ve come here 7 times this year.
Komoka Provincial Park,Grant davies,3,Great hiking spot would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the expensive parking $5.25 for 2 hours.
Komoka Provincial Park,Matthew Emery,5,"Great place for a hike just a short drive outside of London Ontario. Parking is paid now, there is a public washroom. Trails are nice along the river. A good mix of hills and valleys, trails in the woods and also through the meadow valleys. Horses allowed on a few trails. Always have a good time here."
Komoka Provincial Park,Anna Smith,4,I thoroughly enjoyed a mid day walk under the canopy of the Komoka treed park. The ground was easy to navigate. There were some slight inclines that required a little extra effort. I used my urban poles which helped with any climbing. This is new and the only upgrade is a public toilet and gravel for the parking area.
Komoka Provincial Park,Lynn Adore,4,"Beautiful park for walking and hiking. Parking is I think $10, which seems a bit high."
Komoka Provincial Park,Paul Blanshard,5,"Probably one of the areas most beautiful parks with breathtaking scenery from the top of the Thames River looking south west. Huge pines and hardwood trees make a magical setting as you walk under their campy of greenery. 

The only ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Adam Lumley,3,Good for a quick hike. The new parking lot although well maintained is overpriced.
Komoka Provincial Park,Shelly Porter,3,Good but the parking meter didn't work
Komoka Provincial Park,Steve Hargraves,4,Parking plentiful but not free. Not really expensive either. But not sure what services you are paying for with the parking fee.
Komoka Provincial Park,Igobe Kutjwe,5,Good and relaxing place to take walks. Paid parking
Komoka Provincial Park,Gottfried Kibelka,4,2 h parking for $5.25 seems a bit steep. Park is close to an urban center and main trails are well worn and wide. Finding vistas of the river in an otherwise flat landscape is pretty neat. Wildflowers are abundant (as is poison ivy!!) ...
Komoka Provincial Park,Canada Canada,5,Nice park for hiking.  Annoying how there is a charge for parking now though.  And that they closed the entrance across the park.  2 access points was much more convenient.
Komoka Provincial Park,Leila Tuomisto,4,Great greenspace with a large pond!
Komoka Provincial Park,Phantom,5,"Beautiful with great trails, It's a very clean and well maintained park that's wonderful for getting out of city life and back into nature!"
Komoka Provincial Park,Duane Vander Hyden,4,Parking should be free. Great trails and quiet park
Komoka Provincial Park,Meet Gajjar,4,Nice place to spend some time alone with nature. Make sure to take a picture of park trail route. There are big chances that you might get lost somewhere in the park. Overall nice place.
Komoka Provincial Park,S Mc,4,Nice park for hiking.  Annoying how there is a charge for parking now though.  And that they closed the entrance across the park.  2 access points was much more convenient.
Komoka Provincial Park,Susanne Schmid,3,"Always nice, but the parking is just too expensive."
Komoka Provincial Park,Jeff Grenier,5,Well maintained. No garbage anywhere
Komoka Provincial Park,Anabel De León,5,"A beautiful place for hiking, nice trails and kids friendly"
Komoka Provincial Park,Matthew Brechun,5,The trails here are exquisite! Check them out if you have the opportunity.
Komoka Provincial Park,Katherine Howett,4,"There are a good range of paths at Komoka and several nice spots you can stop off. Whether you are looking for a good hike or somewhere to stop and enjoy nature, this park is great and within a very short distance of London"
Komoka Provincial Park,Robert Bregman,4,Great walking trails.  Pay for Parking though.
Komoka Provincial Park,Pokyzard TheFurry,4,"A very nice park, a lot of diffrent paths to choose from. One downside is the open field with the sun, very hard to walk in. There's also a lot of steep hills and bugs. If you're planning on hiking here bring LOTS of water and bug spray."
Komoka Provincial Park,Scotty Imrie,5,"Ravines, rivers, and great trees. Deer, owls, turkeys and turtles. Very diverse"
Komoka Provincial Park,Anthony Sitko,4,Great trails. Must pay for parking
Komoka Provincial Park,Chatravi K,5,This place is so beautiful. Very clean trails and facilities. Staff is friendly and very helpful. It's really good for hiking and running. Amazing place for camping and for the family. It has very beautiful scenic sights as well. Recommended 10 outta 10. The drive to get here was very scenic as well
Komoka Provincial Park,Holy Moly,3,"Park down the street, if possible, as there is a fee for parking.   Trail is nice.  There construction on the path ...possibly to update the park?  There is fishing spots not to far, even though it is illegal at this time to catch walleye, but as you know everyone does doesn't follow rules."
Komoka Provincial Park,Mike Kee,5,"Great place for a hike just outside London. Beautiful views of the Thames River valley, and Carolinian forest."
Komoka Provincial Park,Fernando Pardo,5,Great for day activity. Picnics for sure!
Komoka Provincial Park,Erin C,1,Warning!!  I was shocked to hear that they have placed bear snap traps in the park to catch a beaver. This beaver was displaced in the first place to provide water access for the construction of new homes. Other animals are being caught ...
Komoka Provincial Park,Josh Novak,3,Great place to walk but a little busy and they charge money to park.
Komoka Provincial Park,Andrew Jackson,4,"Wonderful natural park near London that has trails that go though grassland, mature woods and a nice long a river side trail.    

Expensive parking with little amenities."
Komoka Provincial Park,Victor Wong,4,Great place for a short hike.
Komoka Provincial Park,Matt Scarpelli,5,"One of the best parks, in and around London! Very long beautiful trails along the river! Lots of parking and many different trails to take! Cardinals, Owels, Blue Jays, Measels, Orioles, all types of wonderful animals!"
Komoka Provincial Park,Joli Kiljam,3,It costs to park here. Around $5 for an hour. The Park itself is okay .
Komoka Provincial Park,Johan Peters,5,This is a great place to hike. It’s not very long but it’s outdoors and it outdoors. Walk the the whole trail at least once.
Komoka Provincial Park,A R,5,"It is just 15 minutes drive from London, but provides a great walkig trail for everyone, even for families with young kids!"
Komoka Provincial Park,Michael Boyle,2,Beautiful place. Too bad the paid parking completely ruined it.
Komoka Provincial Park,Phil Up,4,"Located on the southside of the Thames River, this scenic park is for nature-lovers and outdoor enthusiasts alike. The main trail runs parallel to the river, overlooking turquoise running water and a vast treetop canopy just beyond it. ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Jordan Miller,1,"Paid parking has ruined this place. $5.25 for 2 hours is not worth it at all. The trail maintenance is non existent (see picture), the parking lot often has huge pot holes, and the rest rooms are worse than porta potties. Huge cash grab."
Komoka Provincial Park,Kaz S,4,"Great slice of nature near the city of London. Some excellent and tranquil hiking trials with some pretty nice views of the Thames River Valley. Only drawback of it is now pay parking, minimum $5.25 for two hours. Really though that is ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,John Barnett,3,Not happy with the parking charge. But the park itself is beautiful
Komoka Provincial Park,Marlo Gibson,4,It's ok...for $5.25 worth of parking (that's just for 2 hours) it wasn't really worth it. I'd imagine kids would have a lot of fun playing there but for a hike it's just average.
Komoka Provincial Park,Sydney McGillis,5,Beautiful trails here!
Komoka Provincial Park,Ron Ethridge,1,i couldn't understand the empty parking lot when I pulled in.  It used to be such a popular place when I hiked there regularly. Then I noticed the culprit... a ticket vending machine which lets you buy a $5.20 daypass to go for a walk... very sad.
Komoka Provincial Park,Vahid Ghodsi,4,Quiet beautiful place for a walk
Komoka Provincial Park,Adrian Van Gelderen,5,Great park so peaceful!
Komoka Provincial Park,Mason Evans,4,"Great place for a walk, but huge money grab for blocking off non pay parking. Not spending nearly as much time there anymore."
Komoka Provincial Park,syed Osama hassan,4,If you want to enjoy outdoor try Komoka provincial park
Komoka Provincial Park,Sharon Horne,4,Was there for our AAA hockey game.  Very clean and spacious.  Good seating and plenty of parking.
Komoka Provincial Park,Darren Mair,4,"Nice place for day trip.  Not a good place for a picnic, but lots of nice trails to walk. Some of the paths can also be shared with horses.  

If you don't mind a little walking (10-15 min), you can bring your fishing rod down to the river."
Komoka Provincial Park,ALEXANDER MCLEAN,5,Excellent spot to camp or go for hikes
Komoka Provincial Park,Michael Bembridge,4,Pay parking sucks but the park is great
Komoka Provincial Park,A. Rose,1,"I used to go here all the time, but I refuse to pay for the new parking fee. Don't get me wrong, the trails are ""okay"", but that's it. I have not seen improvements to the park which justify the parking fee."
Komoka Provincial Park,kay esS,2,I cant believe they are charging for parking now. I had been going to this park since I was just a young child and always enjoyed the long walks through the woods. You can walk all the way from komoka to deleware or vice versa. Fantastic ...
Komoka Provincial Park,Oscar Trachmann,4,"Trails should be better marked, otherwise it's great"
Komoka Provincial Park,San Leng,4,Really good place to go for a walk
Komoka Provincial Park,Don F,4,"Nice park. Prefer the right paths/trails more than the left ones. Saw deer and other little forest creatures here. Downside is that you have to pay for parking, but it is inexpensive. It is a provincial park. "
Komoka Provincial Park,Pavlo Kobzar,5,"It takes about 2 hours to go to the farthest corner and back. Walkable in winter, but need strap on cleats"
Komoka Provincial Park,Richard Tait,2,Pay for parking so you can go outside and walk a trail for exercise?  No wonder people sit on the couch. You can't even go for a nature walk without having to bring a pocket full of change or a Visa anymore.
Komoka Provincial Park,Jacob,3,"As many others have noted, was a great spot to go for a short hike or walk the dogs before you had to pay $5+ for parking. New parking spot is in a poor spot that doesn't really allow you to have great access to the whole park. Park trails are great, well marked and well kept. Some beautiful views at both park locations."
Komoka Provincial Park,Adam Helmers,5,Beautiful place. I have enjoyed many peaceful picnics here. And it's so clean and well kept!
Komoka Provincial Park,Lindsey Trinier,1,"Awesome trails to hike around. Feel refreshed after a walk around this trail. I would give this place 5 stars, but the Ontario Government ruined it. $5.25 per/hour to walk around Komoka Trails now. If they can find a way to tax the ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Krystina Habart,5,Lovely quiet trail
Komoka Provincial Park,Andy Deichert,4,"The new parking lot is sizeable. Easy to navigate through the trails. Lots of exploration and scenic views. Very diverse landscape. Coyotes and mountain lion have been spotted here however, keep an eye on smaller animals and children."
Komoka Provincial Park,PETER Kim,1,"I used to go hiking every weekend with my dog when it was free. Now you have to pay 5.25 for 2 hours and it's not worth it. Its ridiculous.The place is very nice to hike. I am hiking down the road now at Warbler Woods, it's free. You can go any time."
Komoka Provincial Park,Janine Dupuis,1,They have put traps around the pond to kill the beaver. They have killed a muskrat.
Komoka Provincial Park,Jeff Mutter,5,Great place to go for a hike
Komoka Provincial Park,Laran McCann,5,Great place to hike and bring the dogs. Don't like having to pay now though...
Komoka Provincial Park,Steve Trotter,3,Nice place for a walk near London ON. Separate walking and biking paths. Washrooms at trailhead. Downside...minimum $5 for 2hrs of parking. $12 daily max. Lots of road noise from surrounding highways.  
Komoka Provincial Park,Shlomo Levi,5,"One of the quiet beauties of London. We regularly go to the Park for a walk, picnic and watch people canoe by.  It is just refreshing."
Komoka Provincial Park,Cam McCallum,2,"Was a great hiking spot when it was free to park. Now there is a minimum charge of $5 (2 hours), but the amenities don't match that price. There are no picnic areas in the park, no shelters, no BBQs, not many benches. They also haven't ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Cameron Brown,4,Beautiful place to hike or fish. Unfortunately the new parking/ entrance charges are a bit much. Surely the high tax rate here in Ontario should be enough to allow us to enjoy our provincial parks.
Komoka Provincial Park,Azikiwe Primus,4,Quiet n clean
Komoka Provincial Park,Luke Durda,5,Very nice location but there is pay parking
Komoka Provincial Park,Adam Wayland,4,"Well maintained trail system in this ""zero funded"" provincial park. One suggestion is that you map out your route in the park ahead of time. Some trails are poorly marked.

Oxford Street entrance has been permanently closed. Google the park for new parking information prior to your trip."
Komoka Provincial Park,Easily Distracted,4,Trails for bikes and horses as well
Komoka Provincial Park,Brad Fishleigh,3,Was great until they made paid parking.
Komoka Provincial Park,Katie Foster,3,"It was a nice trail and the woods are beautiful, lots of varied habitats and terrain with some nice views. However... like many of the other reviewers, I agree that the parking fee is kind of extortionate for $5 for 2hrs. If you're going ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Brian Ferguson,5,Really nice nature preserve outside the city along a high embankment above the river. Really nice trails in the forest.
Komoka Provincial Park,Dorothy Lamond,5,"I have enjoying hiking in the park for years,
 but with the up coming expense of parking I see that this will come to an end.   
I do not object to paying for parking, it just that you have put too high of a price on it.  

I am on a ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Joshua Kubinec,4,"Overall it's a nice park, but they need to get the trails rationalised and blazed so that they're not as confusing.

It's understandable that things are chaotic, but there is still some work to do before this park gets five stars."
Komoka Provincial Park,Manojan Suresh,5,"Awesome place to hike. Amazing atmosphere, saw few deers. Multiple different look landscapes as well"
Komoka Provincial Park,Alisha,4,Nice place to go for a walk and enjoy nature to escape the sounds of the city.  Paid parking and washroom available at the main parking lot.
Komoka Provincial Park,Wayne Dryden,5,Beautiful
Komoka Provincial Park,Blackstone Urban Homes,5,"Not a park it's Teds hugh parcel of land...
Beautyfull I want to purchase it"
Komoka Provincial Park,Brad Petovello,2,"Great place to hike or mountain bike. However, for a parking fee I would expect more trail maintenance, more easily navigable trails, more amenities etc."
Komoka Provincial Park,Andrew Eydt,1,"Awesome place to go hiking, walking, and trail running.
Great, clean trail.

The new parking lot extortion is horrible.  I have never minded dropping a buck or two into provincial park machine.  But $5+ for an hour??   
I'll be going elsewhere - or I will just pull off the road somewhere near an entrance."
Komoka Provincial Park,Trevor Neve,4,"I feel if you are going to charge for parking then at least improve the trails, otherwise it's still the great hiking spot it's always been "
Komoka Provincial Park,Morgan de Lange,2,"The bridges, crossings and trails are not maintained and poorly marked. A lot of the concrete footings on bridges and staircases are falling apart. Some of the west blue /orange trails were almost abandoned. For a provincial park that charges $5-7 for parking I expected better maintenance, especially mid season."
Komoka Provincial Park,Abby Wolfe,3,"It's pretty and a nice walk, but the fact that they put in a parking meter makes it almost not worth it when there are other places you can go for free. It's a minimum of $5 every time you go. For myself, I found that the trails didn't ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Jacob,1,"Best place in London area for a hike. Great views. Well maintained. It won't dissapoint. (edit. this place is now pay per use. overpriced. terrible decision. you guys made a big mistake.  I'm changing my 5 star to  a 1 star, and not likely to revisit)"
Komoka Provincial Park,Daniela Schmidt,5,Good trails over a variety of terrain - some lovely views of river too. 
Komoka Provincial Park,Tim Mason,5,"A great place to go for a walk or a bike ride - particularly early in the morning.
Lots of places to go - lots of paths to explore.
Not too far from the city but you feel as though you are way out in the country."
Komoka Provincial Park,Stephanie Vandendriessche,3,"Never went for a hike there but always has people and pets. Very clean area and lots of laughs so must be a good time in the woods. Hopefully going to go for a hike there soon. The parking lot needs to be redone though, some pot holes but avoidable "
Komoka Provincial Park,Kevin McClelland,4,"Great spot, but costs over $5 now for parking "
Komoka Provincial Park,Kurt Rodowa,4,It's a nice place to go for the day or spend a few hours going for a hike. Parking rates are a little rediculous.
Komoka Provincial Park,Brennan,5,"Love the park, great spot for hiking.  Not happy they put in the pay parking lots.  I don't go here anymore because there are so many free trails in the area."
Komoka Provincial Park,Hazem Daoud,5,What a fun hike we had ! The leaves were all types of colors. Fantastic time in general 
Komoka Provincial Park,Adam Bond,4,"Small, but quite pretty. Good place to walk dogs or go on a short hike. Multitude of atmospheres including open fields, carolinian forest, open red forests, etc."
Komoka Provincial Park,Anal Dave,4,"Very good hike in the backyard of London. I enjoyed it thoroughly. However, a hiking trail map might be useful for the location, along with some garbage bins at the entrance for people to be able to throw their trash."
Komoka Provincial Park,mustafa,5,Very nice
Komoka Provincial Park,spencer clarke,1,They want you to pay to walk on a path
Komoka Provincial Park,Ryan Talbot,5,Fantastic place to hike all year long.
Komoka Provincial Park,Derrick,1,My go to oasis near the city but I will not pay $175 per year to walk in the woods.  I personally never had a problem parking there and my family enjoyed many short trips to the park.
Komoka Provincial Park,Maher A,4,Should include in your summer visit activity list
Komoka Provincial Park,Steve J,5,Nature at it's finest. Great trails and hiking. Was fishing there this weekend and caught a couple large mouth bass and decent walleye.
Komoka Provincial Park,Oliver Law,1,Not worth the $5 you pay for parking. If you go then try and find parking on a side road.
Komoka Provincial Park,David Fraser,1,"it gets one star because you have to give it a rating---Ran, hiked, and walked this trail for 2 decades- now its a pay to play park - improvement to park a bathroom and a pay meter. It is has become a park for those who have large amounts of disposable income. MONEY GRAB!!"
Komoka Provincial Park,Damien Jones,4,Very nice trails that never end :) to much trash though 
Komoka Provincial Park,Matteo Ciccone,2,Beautiful park but the paid parking is ridiculous. Also large piles of horse manure on some trails. 
Komoka Provincial Park,Mike Haarsma,5,Great trails and good fishing spots.  
Komoka Provincial Park,Sandra Milena Lopez Zamora,5,Really beautiful!!!
Komoka Provincial Park,DEREK JAMES,1,"Nice place, but I'm not going to pay what they are asking for parking."
Komoka Provincial Park,Dhruv Dabhi,5,Fantastic place to get lost!
Komoka Provincial Park,Ron K,5,Best nature walk in the London area.
Komoka Provincial Park,Milt Everitt,2,"Unlike most of the other reviews here, I was not quite as impressed with this place as other visitors were. First of all, there's no maps anywhere along the trail that explain where to go or which trail to follow. It's very easy to walk ..."
Komoka Provincial Park,Blair Whitton,1,This was a very nice free hiking trail. Now as of Aug. Our province decided to charge to park your car. Iam Not happy about this to say the least.
Komoka Provincial Park,michael goodliffe,5,Wonderful trails. Bring water and a snack. This place draws you in for a long walk up and down hills alongside the Thames. Worth it.
Komoka Provincial Park,Atieh Motaghi,5,"Peaceful and beautiful trail to walk and enjoy
Full of dense trees
Ear catching sound of wind in the trees"
Komoka Provincial Park,Lee Mann,5,Excellent trails and lots of parking. Landscape is beautiful.
Komoka Provincial Park,Marc Mueller,4,"Nice trails, just watch out for the mountain bikers ripping around and dog poop. Unfortunately, park is not serviced as much as it should be. No garbage cans in parking lots and POA officers not seen too often on trails enforcing laws and regulations."
Komoka Provincial Park,Canadian Adventures,5,The trees and river valley will make your day!
Komoka Provincial Park,Amin Vali,5,Nice trail. Very good for a short out long walk.
Komoka Provincial Park,Mike C,3,Great place for a in the woods casual hike

Komoka Provincial Park,Adam Trela,5,Great trails!  Good for biking and walking.
Komoka Provincial Park,Steven Bowman,5,Our dog loves walking here. 
Komoka Provincial Park,Lee Gibbons,5,Nice hiking spot on the Thames River.  Longest trail will take an hour or so to complete.
Komoka Provincial Park,Len Neil,4,Pay the parking fee (if you're a regular you should buy an Ontario Parks Pass at a campground) and wander fields and forest to the river's edge!
Komoka Provincial Park,Gagnon Gaming,5,An okay fishing experience.  Access is via a long wet walk back to the car after slipping into the water :)
Komoka Provincial Park,Trevor Comeau,5,Great place for a family day
Komoka Provincial Park,Chad Colley,5,Just paying for parking issue
Komoka Provincial Park,Craig Chevalier,4,"It is a great place to go for a hike/walk, but this silly parking situation is definitely a bit annoying. (Used to be free)"

Komoka Provincial Park,Joseph McRae,5,Hidden gem!
Komoka Provincial Park,Connor Leonard,4,This was okay but not that great for a place that makes you pay 
Komoka Provincial Park,Eric Blay,4,Paid parking is unfortunate but still a great escape from the city 
Komoka Provincial Park,David Payne,5,Great natural setting
Komoka Provincial Park,John Blain,5,My favorite place to hike and bike.
Komoka Provincial Park,Andyy Scott,4,A beautiful retreat from the city
Komoka Provincial Park,Tyler Steinback,5,Beautiful place

Komoka Provincial Park,이종우,4,"(Translated by Google) Very good. Autumn leaves are so cool. One thing is not having a rest and no wash basin to wash your hands.

아주 좋아요. 가을속으로 단풍이 너무 멋짐. 한가지 험은 쉴곳이 없고 화장실 손씻을 세면기가 없는 것."
