Sturgeon River Provincial Park,Daniel Hefford,5,I camped out by the sturgeon river during May long weekend. It was really nice and decently fast would love to make it out for a paddle.
Sturgeon River Provincial Park,Dan Pronovost,3,"Very low water in the summer, this is not the place I recommend for white water trips in Ontario. As a through-trip to explore more of Chiniguchi or Temagami area, canoe tripping on part of the Sturgeon River is OK, but I generally avoid it in the summer."
