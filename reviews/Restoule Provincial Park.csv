Restoule Provincial Park,Irene G,2,"Overall a nice park... however, we found that the rangers were unreasonable with the rules. For example, we were all speaking very softly and two rangers popped up from the bush and said we were speaking too loudly... this happened ..."

Restoule Provincial Park,Shawn McPeak,3,Nice park but many electric campsites are on a slope and difficult to level trailer. Also while the beaches are nice and quiet they are also very small and shallow. Maximum depth to buoys is approx 3 feet. Great for smaller children but ...

Restoule Provincial Park,Sneha Mand,4,"I go camping every year and I must say these are more spacious campsites compared to what I've seen before. The park is gorgeous, but the beaches are a let down - quite small, no depth, and murky. Nevertheless, the water is so calming ..."
