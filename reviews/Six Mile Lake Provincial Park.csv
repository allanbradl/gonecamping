Also, atm one of the comfort stations is under Reno's but it's looking very good."
Six Mile Lake Provincial Park,Jeremiah Latour,4,It is a nice park with access to nice water ways. The best thing is you can get a reserve a boat slip so you don't have to pull the boat in and out every time you use it but there is only so many and first come first serve so get there early.
