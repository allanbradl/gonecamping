North Beach Provincial Park,Tom Su,5,"Clear and shallow waters, perfect for kids and dogs. They have a separate area for pets, it‚Äôs not big but doable. 

The shallow water warms up quick in the hot sun. We visited this beach in the middle of September and it was perfect. The dogs enjoyed their time the moment they got back in the car they passed out"
North Beach Provincial Park,Deb Pye,4,I love this beach!! The fact that you have a choice of where to swim.  If you want lake or the bay üòÅ
North Beach Provincial Park,Jeff Johnston,5,With Lake Ontario on one side and North Bay on the other side this park has much to be desired.  The Lake Ontario water has a shallow sandy bottom great for kids.  North Bay on the other side offers warm waters and some nice fishing as ...
North Beach Provincial Park,Mellow Dee,5,If you are looking for a great getaway 1.5 hours east of Toronto. This is where you should go.  At North Beach you get to experience a white sandy beach. Food canteen on site with public outhouse's. Water is very clean and the sand dunes ...
North Beach Provincial Park,Rob Landon,5,"A great alternative to sandbanks and a great spot for a quick swim.

14.00 vehicle entrance
2.00 walk in from the road, can't be beat.

Obviously smaller than its big brother but the same experience, with both sides of the water accessible. 
Dog friendly, but patrolled much more thoroughly than Sandbanks."
North Beach Provincial Park,Rob Tyo,4,"Great day park with access to North Bay lake which is warm and very clean. 

Also access to lake Ontario for bigger waves but much cooler. 

There is a snack bar with poutine we often walk over for and other meals and treats. 

It's reasonably priced and staff are friendly. 

Nice way to spend a day with the family."
North Beach Provincial Park,Terry-Ann Kelly,4,Loved the sectioned off areas for swimming. The buoys helped me to feel safer when my grandson was swimming. I wish I had gone earlier though to get a picnic table. Clean area. I will be returning again.
North Beach Provincial Park,Derek McLellan,4,Beautiful sandy beach. Could walk out pretty far before it got deep enough that I couldn't stand. Not overly busy either. Was 14.50$ for admission with a car and lots of parking right beside the beach.
North Beach Provincial Park,Faye Moxam,5,"Great beach for families, but it can get windy at times. The bay on the other side is perfect for those days. Nice sandy beach and not too busy."
North Beach Provincial Park,Brian Anthony,5,"This is a hidden gem. The beaches are extremely well kept and the area is very clean.  The park staff are very nice, as well as helpful.  Another great visit!"
North Beach Provincial Park,Mark Mcgaughey,5,"Hot on one side cold on the other, my favorite beach for sure"
North Beach Provincial Park,Andrew Raymond,5,A great place to walk your did in the winter
North Beach Provincial Park,Andrew Foster,4,"Fun place to swim, with a calmer side facing pleasant bay, thats perfect for kids and the main beach facing Lake Ontario. The lake side is fun when it gets rougher out (the waves get bigger) but there can be a pretty strong undertow so ..."
North Beach Provincial Park,Tim Collins,5,"Beautiful beach with shallow waters great for families. A bit rocky in spots, but well worth it to enjoy the sandy shores."
North Beach Provincial Park,Jeremy Sale,4,"Waves ahoy. This is a great place because you have two fun options. The main waterfront on the south side, and the inlet on the other side of the road. You can go from metre high waves, to baby-friendly calm water within 100 yards. A great hidden gem, in the middle of beautiful countryside and lakefront."
North Beach Provincial Park,Andrea Seniw,4,A little rocky but nice water and quiet beach compared to Sandbanks. Same soft sand!
North Beach Provincial Park,Brian Livingstone,4,Rocky beach lakeside; but there are 2 beaches to choose from. Interior beach is sandy but im always squeamish about that dropoff.
North Beach Provincial Park,Peter Holmes,5,Beautiful sand bar with access to Lake Ontario on one side and a smaller quiet lake on the other side. Way less crowded than Sandbanks!
North Beach Provincial Park,Natalia Aleykina,5,"Great clean beach, nice pathways. Walking fee 2 dollars adult, 1 for children."
North Beach Provincial Park,Dale T,4,Nice area. Not many services (clean washrooms & change areas) as one would expect for the cost to enter the park but better than increasing the price a lot more!
North Beach Provincial Park,Aleece McLean,5,"Nice clean place, we were on the ""dog side"" so it was quiet, the dogs were well behaved. The water was nice as well. We had a couple fishes that were not afraid of us haha that kept following us ...tiny things..freaked my son out lol but it was a nice time."
North Beach Provincial Park,Fay Cooper,5,"Beautiful beach, lots of room. Having the wavy side and calm side for swimming is nice too"
North Beach Provincial Park,Joshua Wolf Wilcox,4,"Great place even though they were...""closed"""
North Beach Provincial Park,rick sharpe,5,Great beach kind of off the beaten path but that's what makes it so great. 2 sides one calm and other side waves.
North Beach Provincial Park,Ashna Dhillon,4,"Water was clear, and any danger was well marked (like undertows and drop offs). Beaches and dunes were well maintained with minimal litter. Lots of garbage cans, and constant patrol by rangers who are super helpful and constantly handing ..."
North Beach Provincial Park,Bill Pennell,5,Fantastic soft sand beach and relatively warm water.  Great view.
North Beach Provincial Park,Robert Rosenfeld,5,Surprisingly lovely beach. Entry fee was a bit steep perhaps
North Beach Provincial Park,Greg Pieon,5,Beatiful place for a day of swimming or just enjoying what life has to offer.
North Beach Provincial Park,Jamie Mitchell,4,"Great beach but bathrooms need to be upgraded, other then that we had fun..."
North Beach Provincial Park,Amir Reza Mousavi,4,Can we bring our own charcoal bbq here ? (And not drop ashes on the sands of course )
North Beach Provincial Park,Stacey Staley,5,"I‚Äôm hesitant to tell people how much I like this beach because I am afraid it will get too busy with tourists and the overflow of the Sandbanks. However, this is such a nice spot. Clean and dig friendly too."
North Beach Provincial Park,Chris Mason,4,Clean beach. Lots of space. Clean water
North Beach Provincial Park,Kris Daniel,5,Great location! Was pretty clean. Not the best place for dogs to run free but a good spot none the less. Plan on parking on the street and walking in (its cheaper) or if you have a ton of stuff the it cost a bit more to drive in and park.
North Beach Provincial Park,David di Genova,5,"Strong undertow at times, but a great beach"
North Beach Provincial Park,Jonathan Glasser,5,"Really nice, clean beaches.  Nice staff as well."
North Beach Provincial Park,Timothy Charran,1,"Change rooms and bathrooms absolutely gross. Water filthy. It is Lake Ontario. Nothing in town but a Walmart. No KFC no Popeyes,  canadian tire."
North Beach Provincial Park,Laura Bowley,4,"Not nearly as crowded as Sandbanks but with a sandy Beach and shallow water. Beach is clean, water is pretty nice."
North Beach Provincial Park,Andy Chang,5,One of the nicest beach in Ontario. The park is maintained very well and the staff are friendly. The park has great space for parking. The cars are also parked near the water so you have say access to your car. Also the water is very ...
North Beach Provincial Park,Jack Brooks,4,Nice little beach to bring young children to.
North Beach Provincial Park,Dan Serson,5,always love going there can even take you dogs
North Beach Provincial Park,Michael Garlick,5,Nice alternative to Sandbanks if its crowded.  West facing beach gets sun all afternoon and its a reasonable sized beach with lots of parking very close to the sand.
North Beach Provincial Park,Cameron Schettler,5,A great beach with spectacular sunsets
North Beach Provincial Park,Mayouran Paramananthan,2,We are paying for the service but maintenance was not enough. I would expect to be clean when taking kids.
North Beach Provincial Park,Paula Penson,5,"Great beach! Sandy, clean, not usually crowded.  We prefer the lake side, but if you have younger kids the bay side is calmer and quieter.   There are lots of bathrooms, change rooms, parking lots, and there is a little store that sells ..."

North Beach Provincial Park,Paul Dean,1,"The quieter side is covered in poop, dead fish, cigarette butts and debris.  It was much nicer when I brought my children around 8 years ago. I wouldn't let a small child play in it.  I tried to call to let someone know but I was hung up ..."

North Beach Provincial Park,Hashim Bhamji,3,Visit for summer is good
North Beach Provincial Park,Marta Stojanovic,4,"Clear water. Not many people. No shade though, so we didin't stay for long. We decided to come here since Sandbanks was full and it was a great alternative. Beach itself is not sandy, but the bottom of the lake is. Washrooms are very ..."
North Beach Provincial Park,Jacqueline McKeaveney,5,"Beautiful Beaches. Northside is turqoise blue green with choppy waters , and cross the road and enjoy the calmer waters of a large lake! BEAUTIFUL THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS!"

North Beach Provincial Park,Brenda Wilson,5,Love this beach.
North Beach Provincial Park,Cesar Ruiz,5,"Great beach its never too crowded since its not as popular its a hidden gem, beach is well cleaned and the sand is maintained.

North Beach Provincial Park,Robbie Craig,5,"Gorgeous beach, almost never crowded. Dog beach is quite nice."
North Beach Provincial Park,David Wiseman,3,This year (2017) craptacular - (1 star) last year pariadisical (5 stars). All due to lake levels.  See my photos for a complete understanding of the diametrically opposing states.
North Beach Provincial Park,Marj Salavich,5,Great beach! Shallow for a good distance. Warm water. Shade trees. Easy access. Lots of parking. Great for groups/picnics.
North Beach Provincial Park,Tim Maw,4,Not much beach left here this year due to high water. Slot less crowded than the outlet beach.
North Beach Provincial Park,Abba Ji,3,"Not a big park by any stretch of the imagination. Actually, not even a park! A good beach though! Weekend was very busy. Probably not worth the $14.50/car."

North Beach Provincial Park,Greg Cowie,5,"A real gem. More shade than Sandbanks, and less used. There are two beaches here; one on the Lake Ontario side offering infinite horizons, often windy and pounded by small waves (with a resulting undertow), and one on the bay side with a calm, sandy beach, and a steep drop-off after a short shallow slope into the water."
North Beach Provincial Park,Saiyid Rashaad,5,One of the finest beachs around Belleville

North Beach Provincial Park,Lemon Grub,5,Best beach around. Better than Sandbanks because it is less populated.

North Beach Provincial Park,Hasit Shah,5,"beautiful place for a summer day out with family, nice winds and clear blue water with ocean like waves!!!"
