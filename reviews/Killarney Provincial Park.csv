Killarney Provincial Park,Nico Valenton,5,"Awesome and amazing nature, hope to see this preserved for many years to come. The La Cloche trail is great and people on it are nice. Way nicer than people at The Crack. Going through the Crack ruins the experience due to litter, impoliteness, and well it's nearing the end of you're going clockwise."
Killarney Provincial Park,Rocket Man,5,"wonderful, and beautiful. Went four years In a row, and it just as good every time. Pack up, and go for hike with you're friends for a few nights it's great."
Killarney Provincial Park,Paulette Quesnel,5,"We just went to hike along a trail.  We didn't camp. Parking for the day was 15$.  We took the shortest hike, 
Granite Ridge, posted as mild - moderate, with some steep parts.  It was posted at 1 and a half to 2 hours.  It was beautiful. ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Agnes Pichette,5,"Go ALL THE WAY to the end of the road! GAS is available.  Worth the drive. Fish n chip place is good, shops are cool, Prov park awesome. Went sailing right off the dock, took the tourboat anther time. Very enjoyable!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Isabella Jusková,5,A beautiful getaway just a few hours north of Toronto. I enjoyed summer hiking and camping in the AB campsites. We even saw a baby black bear run across our site in the morning. This park is what more of Ontario should look like.
Killarney Provincial Park,Rick MacLeod,5,"We went on a canoe trip through Bell Lake - Three Mile - Balsam - Deacon on the way in. Stayed 2 nights on the island camp site on Deacon Lake. The first night, we hunkered down through the 80km/hr the storm (remnants of Florence). We ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Candice Mitchell,5,"Had an incredible trip here last October. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a true escape. Hiking and canoeing we ran into 3 people over 4 days, total privacy on back country camp sites. Check in and cost were very reasonable. 

Note: We didn’t encounter any bugs or much wildlife in October."
Killarney Provincial Park,Steffen Wiseman,5,Stunning. An absolute gem. The photo below was taken at the portage between George and Freeland Lake. All Canadians must go at least once in their life.
Killarney Provincial Park,samanthi de zoysa,5,Killarney Provincial Park is one of my favorite places in Ontario. Breathtaking scenery. We camped at site 126 at George Lake 26th to 28th June 2015. Weather was great. Nights were lovely. Not too warm or cold. Wash rooms and water tap ...
Killarney Provincial Park,Brent Helwig,5,"An absolutely spectacular experience!!! The quartzite rock, the backcountry grandeur, the clear water... my favourite portaging park hands down. Be sure to hike silver peak...leave a full day for that! You’ll be glad you did! So beautiful!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Chris Fuerth,5,"Like a group of 7 painting. Trails are all great, but start at moderate level. Plan for mosquitoes and keeping your site bear safe.  We stayed in a yurt. The only thing I would have brought that we didn't think of was a fan, as it was stuffy under the mid day sun"
Killarney Provincial Park,Addy Kam,5,"A beautiful, serene and quiet place to bring family or go with friends. The Crack trail was quiet challenging but worth it once you reach the top. Wasn't lucky with the fishing, but nonetheless would come back!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Jagdish S,4,"Awsome place. Excellent trekking trails. Very pretty. Carry plenty water, fully charged electronics, cause once you enter, things are hard to come by."
Killarney Provincial Park,Ian MacDonald,5,"Beautiful landscape, great facilities and services. Highly recommended for backcountry canoeing, but you need to book really far ahead of time."
Killarney Provincial Park,Peter Stevens,5,As a group we canoe during the shoulder seasons every year somewhere in northern Ontario.  Killarney Provincial Park offers challenging portages and incredible scenery...this time we stayed on O.S.A. lake on the big island....awesome.  Would highly recommend this as a camping/hiking or canoeing destination to anyone.
Killarney Provincial Park,Matthew Lahey,5,"My favourite provincial park. The sights are amazing, the people are amazing,  and so is the fish and chips truck just outside the park. It is far away from the big city but well worth the travel time to get there. Not as big as ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Brooke Petrovich,5,Try and visit every year. Favourite park in 9ntario. La Cloche Trail is breathtaking. And actually moderately challenging!
Killarney Provincial Park,Americo,4,"As a park is amazing.
But the rangers need more training.
Not enough information of which camps are free. They said... go and see and if is occupied then paddle to next one (Lake George camps).
They need a better system.
But, once in nature that human factor is not relevant anymore."
Killarney Provincial Park,Hamin J,5,"I love this park. It's so big, you can keep coming back and discover new places. We went hiking along the La Cloche Trail and booked a campsite along there, H2 Lumsden. So secluded, beautiful site and a whole lake to ourselves. The staff ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Sanjeewa Abeykoon,5,"Amazing & beautiful park. It is worth to drive around 4 + hours from Toronto. We camp near George lake and beach is so nice. There are small cliffs even kids can dive to water. If you are hiking don't miss granite trail (start near the park office ) , you can spot even Manitoulin island and light house too."
Killarney Provincial Park,Jack Jesberger,5,So beautiful. The backcountry trails are challenging and the campsites lovely. Recommend fall when mosquitos and black flies are absent.
Killarney Provincial Park,Dave Wormald,5,Killarney has a well-deserved reputation as a spectacular wilderness park. It doesn't matter which direction you enter the park from.  It's all beautiful. The white quartzite of the La Cloche mountains never fails to impress. Unspoiled beauty and no crowds are a great combination. Enjoy!
Killarney Provincial Park,Roshani Wijeratne,4,"It's a beautiful park, the crack was more difficult than I thought it was going to be but very much worth the hike! The beach view was amazing. The camp site we choose was cramped and not very private at all, we could see everything our neighbor campers were doing."
Killarney Provincial Park,rachel wray,5,"Love killarney didnt want to leave. This place is absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and there is so much to explore. Perfect place for the outdoorsy people. The Killarney outpost store is really cool place to check out as well as the coast by the light house is breath taking."
Killarney Provincial Park,sharanjad,5,Extremely gorgeous park. Did a canoe trip here and had the time of my life .
Killarney Provincial Park,Andrew Farrer,4,"Quiet but remote. If prepared for the initial 300m portage, Massauga is almost as good but a lot easier to access"
Killarney Provincial Park,Colleen Ridley,5,"We hiked (walk, stop, collect acorns, eat at the top, rest, enjoyed the view) slowly for 2.5 hours (1 hour up, 1 hour eating and enjoying the top, 1/2 hour down) the short part of Granite Ridge trail (we didn't do the long loop just came ..."

  No services at camp sites.  Lots of trails, nice beach.  Telescope for supervised group activity."
Killarney Provincial Park,ilyas khamis,5,"I went here for Victoria day weekend and, barring some unfortunate rain, it was a great time. Camping is one of the few times I want to be in the middle of nowhere, and this is where Killarney thrives. There's a small town a few dozen ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Sean O'Hare,5,"We had a very pleasant experience hiking throughout the park. All the bikes we completed were scenic, not difficult for a 30 year old, and enjoyable. Bring water! 
We drove around the main camping location and it looks good, but we ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Earl Veale,4,First canoe trip in 35 years. What a great adventure. The camping area has 5/5 shower facilities to get yourself cleaned up for the drive home. Looking forward to the next time.
Killarney Provincial Park,Brian Zubert,5,"This place is beautiful. The water is crystal clear, the scenery is outstanding, and the nearby town of Killarney is a really nice compliment. The trek down the highway is longer than you'd expect, but being only an hour and a half away from Sudbury, I'd put it high on a must visit list."
Killarney Provincial Park,Tim,5,100km hike what can I say.  It ain't the parks fault.  Do it
Killarney Provincial Park,Shell Carr,5,This is the first time I have come so late in the season. It was a pleasant surprise to see it full as usual but with more serious campers. I do not see campers not taking care of garbage properly like I have in previous times I have ...
Killarney Provincial Park,Rebecca Rourke,5,"BEAUTIFUL park! Stayed in the radio-free part of the park and it was exactly what we wanted to relax in nature. The wind coming off the lake was very cold, but with multiple layers it was okay! My only wish is that people wouldn't bring ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Zeiad El Kady,5,"Gorgeous place. Clean great kayaking, exploring, swimming and fun for the whole family...make sure to get gas early on before getting tot he park because the only gas station is in town is much more expensive and hard to get into if you have a trailer."
Killarney Provincial Park,Shannon MacInnes,5,"A beautiful park. If travelling in the summer, I highly recommend checking the bug report on The Weather Network's website. Take it seriously and don't feel self-conscious about purchasing a bug-net suit. You won't be the only one, and ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Elana Fiegehen,5,my favourite provincial park so far
Killarney Provincial Park,Shane Grant,5,"The hike was pretty intense, well for me maybe but this place is truly beautiful. If you haven't gone you have to at least visit once! You won't regret it!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Darryl Grossauer,5,"This place is a true hidden gem.  

My family has been visiting George Lake every year for over half a century, camping, portaging, hiking, and just enjoying the beautiful sights and scenery and it never gets old.  Majestic old growth ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,Nicole Gould,4,"So much to do and explore. Our site was clean, campground is small and quiet, bathrooms and comfort stations were clean. Beach is decent. Only downside is you have to leave the campground to rent canoes or kayaks from the Outfitters"
Killarney Provincial Park,martino daniells,4,Great park with lots of great camping areas and trails
Killarney Provincial Park,Chris Meunier,5,This park is so beautiful. Some of the portages can be a bit daunting like the 3000+ m into Three Narrows (well in bug season at least). But it is well worth it. And a lot of the park can be accessed by day users!
Killarney Provincial Park,Brittany Brugman,5,I wasn't able to make it to the top of the crack trail but what an amazing veiw
Killarney Provincial Park,NANCY ENNEST,4,It is a beautiful park.  Even as cold as it was when we were there.
Killarney Provincial Park,Darryl Denike,5,"Beautiful Park.  Make sure you have a reservation.  When you turn off highway 69, your still about a hour away from the park."
Killarney Provincial Park,Pavel Mader,4,"Beautiful park, kind of remote from Toronto, but has a nice and relaxing atmosphere. Good for ""meeting"" wildlife. Met a black bear on one of the trails. Offers posibilities of camping in tents and trailers (better book well in advance) but also backcountry and canoe campsites."
Killarney Provincial Park,Amir Ali Golbazi,5,"As a landscape photographer I definitely recommend this national park to anyone in Ontario. Its one of the best national parks in Ontario let alone Canada! Lots of trails, camping spots and enough challenging terrain for all fitness ..."
Killarney Provincial Park,laura m,5,Love how many trails there are and had a great time! Used campsite in the 20's it was well away from everyone else. Saw a beaver while canoeing! Everyone was very dog friendly and that made it an easier and comfy place to be. Great ...

Killarney Provincial Park,Tamara Bilchenko,5,Beautiful park. But to see its  beauty you must hiking or kayaking.
Killarney Provincial Park,Colin Gillies,5,I'm reluctant to tell you how much I love this park. We go backcountry. Very hard to get a reservation to a great Lake but damn! It's very Wabi - Especially when the weather is inclement. Competent staff. They need to address the bear- hang problem - too many broken branches
Killarney Provincial Park,Samantha Crum,4,This provincial park is located on a channel of lake George and has clear high ph water over granite rocks. This was our 3rd family camping trip and we can't wait to go back next year!
Killarney Provincial Park,Jeff Dubkowski,5,The Crack is the best hike I have ever done and worth every second. It's a difficult hike with plenty of uphill.
Killarney Provincial Park,Tom Li,5,Very beautiful place and the trails are definitely a challenge too!
Killarney Provincial Park,Curtis Charlton,5,Great visit to Killarney. Backcountry camping was awesome! The sites we stayed at were all gorgeous. Will definitely be back!
Killarney Provincial Park,Simcoe County Roamer,5,"Had an awesome back country canoe trip including hiking Silver Peak, highly recommend!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Andrew Farrer,4,"Classic Georgian Bay park but very quiet. Starting at Three Mile Lake, we saw 6 other paddlers over a 4 night stay. Some tough portages probably deter most."
Killarney Provincial Park,uJennifer Reid,3,With how much hype there is about killarney I must say I was disappointed. The park was nice although I didn't love that they only have outhouses. There is nice hiking trails and the beach was just just down the road from our site. Would ...

Killarney Provincial Park,WAFFLE GUY STUDIOS,5,Loved everything but the bugs! Absolutely beautiful! Will go back.

Killarney Provincial Park,Brady Coggins,5,"I would go back in a heart beat. Do yourself a favour and rent a canoe/kayak and do a portage or two. The rock faces are breath taking. Also, go to the crack!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Kay Chen,5,Come early for the non reservable camp sites. The crack trail is a about 4 hours long with beautiful views. I would recommend the chickenising trail which is also close by and shorter with better views.
Killarney Provincial Park,Chris Duke,4,"Beautiful provincial park. Beautiful quartzite rounded hills, trails, beautiful canoeing. Good camp sites. You must preserve the water quality because it is rejuvenating from mine pollution atmospheric deposition. The views from the hills are beautiful. Saw a bear that ran away fast."

Killarney Provincial Park,jerrad kyle,5,"I have been coming to Killarney since before I could walk. It is one of the most incredible little places to go to in Canada, little own Ontario. The Georgian Bay inlet allows for great fishing trips, as well as be surrounded by many ..."

Killarney Provincial Park,Evgeny Blank,3,Very nice but the rucuns burn the nights.

Don't miss The Crack (Spectacular View). It is almost Hard but it is worth seeing it."
Killarney Provincial Park,Paul Blanchon,3,"Killarney is a fantastic park with stunning scenery, the camp site at George Lake is set within dense forest and thus plagued by mosquitoes. If you visit during a fire ban this makes for an uncomfortable time."
Killarney Provincial Park,Normand Robert,5,My favourite Ontario provincial park
Killarney Provincial Park,Raphael Mabalot,5,Awesome Provincial park. My family and I drove from Hunstville up to Killarney and this park does not dissapoint. Although we were only here for around 2 hours the views never dissapointed. For sure going back to try out their 2 day durated trail.
Killarney Provincial Park,Maggie Daniel,5,We had a great weekend at the park. We went mid June so there were not many other groups there. The camping spaces are large and flat. Lots of space to set up tents and vehicles. There is a dog beach and some really nice hiking trails. The washrooms are maintained very well.

Killarney Provincial Park,Suzanne Krause,5,"Beautiful, clean, friendly and helpful staff!!"

Killarney Provincial Park,Saara Simard,4,Absolutely love this park!

Killarney Provincial Park,Dan Scott,5,"Easy access to a variety of great, challenging hikes. Located on the banks of George Lake, providing a beautiful view and paddling if you bring your boat. Lots of campsites, including paddle and hiking access sites: just book early!"
Killarney Provincial Park,Marcin Tandecki,5,"One of the nicest parks in Ontario. It'd drive-able from major cities, but still remote enough to have a lot of undisrupted nature. Lots of really nice hiking trails.
The park although large, doesn't have a lot of campground space, and it fills up pretty quickly. If you intend on going, book early."
