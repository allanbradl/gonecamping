Algonquin  Kearney Lake Campground,Juan Carlos S,5,"Good location. Good amount of showers, not all of them were working though. Beach is not the nicest but it was OK."
Algonquin  Kearney Lake Campground,Anna Marrello,4,Camp here every year. Decent sized sites. Nothing to far to the beach or comfort station. Outhouses need to be cleaned more often though. And the craters in the road.
