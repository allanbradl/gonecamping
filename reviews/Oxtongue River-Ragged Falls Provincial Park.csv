Oxtongue River-Ragged Falls Provincial Park,Shivamohan M.P.,4,Nice waterfall to visit. We went during fall too see the foliage. We were late as most of the leaves had already fallen. But the falls was good looking and had a nice time.
Oxtongue River-Ragged Falls Provincial Park,Outdoor Adventurer,5,"This is a hike i recommend you do.  Its only 350 Meters in length but OMG well worth the hike.   Such a Gorgeous view of the water fall.

Oxtongue River-Ragged Falls Provincial Park,Ceolwyn23,5,"Beautiful waterfall. Nice trail to get to the lookout - we went on a whim so weren't necessarily dressed for hiking but it wasn't too bad, we just didn't climb down the rocks.

Wardens there at the time putting up a sign were friendly. ..."
Oxtongue River-Ragged Falls Provincial Park,Daniel Hefford,5,"Short hike in the summer, however make sure you pay to park. In the winter it's free but you have to park outside the park and hike in.
