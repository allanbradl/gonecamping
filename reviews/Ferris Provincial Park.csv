Ferris Provincial Park,Kiyiya Howling Wolf,5,"Beautiful, beautiful park.

I enjoyed going here even as a young kid, riding her bike through it. I spent many hours working out here and saw varying forms of wildlife such as foxes, raccoons, bear, and deer.

It's the kind of quiet ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,samanthi de zoysa,3,"Nice camping sites. Few trails to go on. Enjoyed the Ranney Falls trail, the falls, the suspension bridge  and the turtles. On the downside there is no lake within campground. Only swimming is in an indoor pool. Being a very warm weekend we had find natural water to dip in which was a half hours drive."
Ferris Provincial Park,Steve Paul,5,"This was our very first trip to the park. Parker was incredibly helpful at the main kiosk, great addition to the team! Beautiful views and trails to walk around different areas of the park. Of course the views from the Trellis bridge are the main draw, and they are worth the walk. I would recommend this spot to anyone!"
Ferris Provincial Park,Kathy Savage,5,Simply beautiful.  Summer or winter. A fantastic place to visit.
Ferris Provincial Park,Eric McStravick,4,"This is a very small park (160 sites.)  Most of it is designed for small tent trailers or tents and very little power (only 40.)  But it was fun.  Its a good place for fall/spring camping as a trek to Timmies is about 4km, and being cold you won't care that there isn't any swimming."
Ferris Provincial Park,Oleg,4,It’s a park! Got in late when it got dark. So it was a bit of an effort to find my place (bicycling in). Sucks that it’s 40 bucks just to shower/sleep and leave the moment it’s light again. But hey. I like to support Park system.
Ferris Provincial Park,B McElheron,1,Terrible place to go camping. There is only one shower for all 163 campsites. Comfort stations are old and dirty.  We went camping in the Bedrock campground with the kids and met up with friends for the July long weekend. We were all ...
Ferris Provincial Park,Shannon Murdock,3,We would camp here again. Lovely park. Roads are rough and the comfort station is what earned this 3 stars. For an entire campground there is only 1 shower on the male and female side for everyone. Needs to be updated badly. Trails were nice but needs to be marked better.
Ferris Provincial Park,Laura Franks,5,"Quiet, really close to a small town near by for quick shopping trips. Friendly and helpful staff, let us change our site reservation to a different site once we arrived and saw the sites.  We very much enjoyed our stay here and will be back.  We definitely recommend this park."
Ferris Provincial Park,Michael Bechard,5,"Great provincial park for camping or a day trip! Several hiking trails of various difficulties, biking trails, and a cool suspension bridge looking out to some waterfalls and rapids. Fun place for the whole family!"
Ferris Provincial Park,Torun,3,My honest opinion is...this place is overrated. Only hanging bridge and fall like rivers are the attraction. Not that much of color you will get in fall.
Ferris Provincial Park,David Touchette,4,"Cute park, well maintained, if you need two sites together you can get privacy. Other sites are zero shade or privacy. Was able to find an inlet that was safe to swim, off one of the trails close to the boat launch"
Ferris Provincial Park,Neil Koehn,5,"A great park with a excellent ranger staff.  They were friendly & helpful, truly went out of their way to help visitors.  Nice choice of campgrounds & lots to do.  Very kid friendly place!"
Ferris Provincial Park,karen miller,5,Wonderful place to hike. Nice trails and beautiful views.
Ferris Provincial Park,Jayne Zavitski,5,"This place is underrated. It has great hiking/biking trails, nice large campgrounds, scenic bridge, playground and is walking distance to town."
Ferris Provincial Park,Kristen Timpson,4,"We just returned from a 3 day weekend trip to Ferris. Overall, the park was lovely. The comfort stations are on the older side, but were generally quite clean (I have seen much worse). The park staff were very friendly as well. The only ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Lisa Butson,5,Great campsites! Wonderful hiking and biking! Close to town for supplies too!
Ferris Provincial Park,Nima Dehghansai,5,"Love this place. Great trails, a mini swimming area and nice camping spots. Close to city yet you feel like you're out in the woods."
Ferris Provincial Park,B Inthavong,4,Lovely place right in Campbellford. Trails are well maintained and very easy to do. Estimated times are very exaggerated; I casually walked the River Gorge Trail and it took me way less then an hour compared to the 2 hrs mentioned on the ...
Ferris Provincial Park,Sue Palmateer,3,Not a bad park but trails are not marked well. Knowing where we were going would have made our visit more enjoyable.
Ferris Provincial Park,Sanjeewa Abeykoon,3,Recommend only for day trips and not for car camping. Not adequate comfort stations/showers. Always long lineup for showers during summer. No beach or a  place for any water activity.
Ferris Provincial Park,Ahmed Al Sammarraie,5,Was very nice camping ⛺️ two hours drive from Durham area family camping recommended
Ferris Provincial Park,Gary Clarke,3,Nice place with a few exceptions. One shower for the whole park and our site was littered with somebody's dirty underwear and trash. Spent the first 1/2 hour taking rib bones from my dog that he kept finding. However the trails are awesome and sites are private.
Ferris Provincial Park,Petra Dettmann,4,"We love it there for the peace and quiet. We have a travel trailer, so we do not use the amenities of the park much, but this time we had friends with us and we found out there are only two showers in the whole park. Also the roads are in terrible condition and maintenance is almost non existing."
Ferris Provincial Park,Tracy Bayley-buckle,2,We had a great visit but the one BIG problem is that there is only one shower for women and one for men in the whole camp ground.  Lines ups all the time.  You guys really need to install a shower block like other Provincial Parks. Will not go back for this reason
Ferris Provincial Park,Ed FAKHREDDINE,5,"I liked this park, some privacy, people are nice, water is close by, roads are good, washrooms clean, and nice paths to walk around"
Ferris Provincial Park,ivanna maksymiv,2,"Not enough recycling bins! Found only one recycling centre with only two bins, and they were completely loaded."
Ferris Provincial Park,suaz z,3,Nothing much to see except the suspension bridge. You can come from back side and save $11 on day pass to cross that bridge. The road inside the park is not paved and too much dust by cars
Ferris Provincial Park,Amr Omar,5,Very nice and small park. We loved our short camping stop here.
Ferris Provincial Park,Canadiana North,3,Reasonable campsite near the pretty town of campbleford... campsite was not the picture I was shown on the reservation...   pretty paid online and still no closer to sorting out park permit... Saud office was open to 11...  sign says ...
Ferris Provincial Park,rabsalan,4,"Very clean park even though the road is gravel.
Very pleasant staff and helpful"
Ferris Provincial Park,Michael Garlick,4,Nice waterfalls and riverside trail.  The suspension bridge is a great spot to take pictures of the river and falls.  Its really great in the spring when the water is running fast.
Ferris Provincial Park,Leo K,5,So much fun! Go around 5 times maybe. Great for taking pictures.
Ferris Provincial Park,Gord Ruttan,4,"Great park, but the comfort station needs upgrades 1men and 1 ladies shower not enough."
Ferris Provincial Park,Kathy Stickwood,5,Met with daughter and her family camping they had great time will be back
Ferris Provincial Park,Sameer and Varsha Khatri,5,"Its perfect for overnight camping trip and or day trips. Washrooms are clean and nice, and site is very safe"
Ferris Provincial Park,Jennifer Duczmal,5,Crossing the tention bridge. Great weekend adventure exploring the area.
Ferris Provincial Park,Ares Chen,3,Not worth 12$ if you just come here for the bridge.
Ferris Provincial Park,Tiffany Walker,5,Cant wait to come back
Ferris Provincial Park,Whitby Ontario,5,Very awesome  park one of the best parks we have visited  clean well kept .
Ferris Provincial Park,Oren Pollak,5,Great roadside stop!
Ferris Provincial Park,Alistair Renshaw,5,Well maintained. Lots of photo ops
Ferris Provincial Park,Steven Soanes,5,The bridge is definitely the highlight
Ferris Provincial Park,Emran Toronto,4,"It's a beautiful place, the hanging bridge is beautiful"
Ferris Provincial Park,Steve Tjiang,5,Easy access from town. The very safe suspension bridge is very good for those who are scared of heights but still want a quick thrill. In the spring and early summer the waterfall and rapids are an awesome sight. Great place to go for a casual walk. There is an easy flat path as well as safe steeper area for active kids.
Ferris Provincial Park,Nick Broadley,3,Staff was really nice. Camp grounds are nice and clean. Locals in town don't really like tourist. Only has one shower per gender for the whole park. Holds around 145 camp sites. So get in early or really late for a shower or prepare to ...
Ferris Provincial Park,Aries Styrene,4,Amazing location . some good some bad sites . just do your research
Ferris Provincial Park,Steven Pereira,2,"Could be better. 

No showers. 

Bathrooms are too far."
Ferris Provincial Park,ashish tamboli,5,"Amazing bridge and trails, nice place for a days hike and picnic"
Ferris Provincial Park,J R.W,4,"Great park, was quiet and we had a fairly private site. Best to take a drive through to choose one as some are pretty open. There isn't really swimming but there are trails to walk/hike and a great view at the suspension bridge. Only ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Corey Dunn,5,Amazing park... lots to see and do in the area
Ferris Provincial Park,Agnibesh Hazarika,3,Decent park. Biggest drawback-there is only ONE shower for the entire campground.
Ferris Provincial Park,Randy Millage,3,"The physical space is wonderful but Ontario Parks have been left to decline. Facilities have been deteriorating and seasons shortened as prices rise.
Nonetheless, I enjoy the walking and cycling trails, the Ranney River Gorge and the ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Em Chen,4,"We visited this park on a day trip for a very reasonable price of $11.25/vehicle. The trails are beautiful and have a combination of scenic fields, hilly forested areas, and a walk along the river. I was not impressed by the proximity to ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Dianne Toth,4,Loved it would of loved to spend longer.
Ferris Provincial Park,Keyur Bhalodia,3,Place is good but washroom is in bad shape and only 1showe for total site
Ferris Provincial Park,Wil Pialagitis,4,Very nice camping location.  Lots of assorted sites with many variances.  Found the campers respectful of each other and quiet.  Close to town incase you forgot anything but still quiet.  The kids play area was lacking but nature helped make up for it.
Ferris Provincial Park,Jason Harris,5,It has good hiking trails
Ferris Provincial Park,John Jerry,3,dont let Wynne rip you off.. go over to the town side and enter via power station bridge
Ferris Provincial Park,Sahil Chopra,3,"Good day trip but that’s it, it’s too small for much more than that"
Ferris Provincial Park,Chris Boodhoo,5,The suspension bridge was a cool experience for me. I got a cheap kayak rental from the park office and got to check out the falls/ bridge from below which was nice. Definitely a place to check out.
Ferris Provincial Park,Margery Walton,5,A park within the town a great get away to walk and smell nature and be beside water the whole time
Ferris Provincial Park,Anish Dalmia,3,There isnt really anything to do and there is only 1 shower for the entire park.
Ferris Provincial Park,Jeff Willis,3,"Good sized rv and camping sites. Water snakes observed near river, park advises they can bite if startled but are not poisonous. Also noticed poison ivy on trails but not on sites. Close to toen for resupply of provisions."
Ferris Provincial Park,Alana Fearnall,4,"Ferris Park is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon. You can walk in from Campbellford through a few different entrances, and you have your pick of multiple different trails. 

Even when it's filled with cars you won't run into more ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Lynda,3,We only did a day visit for the hiking trails so cannot comment on camping facilities. Trails are not bad but could be better maintained. Perhaps widening of the trails to reduce risk of contact with ticks and poison ivy. Some of the ...
Ferris Provincial Park,Fraser Nuttall,5,This place is a great small campground. The trail is nice and marked with different tree species which is great if you love trees as I do. The suspension bridge is neat and the town is really close in case you forget something. Check out the cheese place and the chocolate factory in Campbellford.
Ferris Provincial Park,s vanderteems,4,"Beautiful quieter park. Great for families.  Playground on site. well maintained with clean facilities, friendly staff. Hydro avail. Lots of deer rabbits chipmunks etc. Great fishing with launch   kayak rentals.  Scenery is beautiful.  Check out the suspension bridge.  Note it is on  a river with current. no beach "
Ferris Provincial Park,Marina Cernecca,2,One shower for the campground.   Pot holes galore.  No swimming allowed. Sloped and rocky site.   Fishing is best with a boat.  Not a park I'd recommend highly.  There are many better parks to camp.
Ferris Provincial Park,1 Sarhan,5,Very nice hiking trails and suspension bridge! Great place to go for a hike or walk! Trails are very flat and marked well!
Ferris Provincial Park,Robert DeForest,4,While we were only there for 2 nights the site was good both in size and privacy. Park has a couple nice sights as well as lots of trails to keep us busy. Only bad thing was fire wood we bought was wet
Ferris Provincial Park,Alexander Daunan,3,"The suspension bridge is awesome. You can see the river under your feet. The bridge will shake everytime people walk on it. The road from the office park to the parking lot is a gravel, not paved. They need to put more benches & tables for picnic."
Ferris Provincial Park,Mel Rodriguez,5,Need a tranquility? Away from city noice? Come and check md out!
Ferris Provincial Park,Rob Taubmann,3,Nice enough park.  Comfort stations show signs of age...only one shower per gender per area (and no on site swimming spot).  Many spots grass/open.  Walking distance to town.
Ferris Provincial Park,k D,4,"Beautiful park, but quite pricey for a day pass. Skip the payment and walk-in over the suspension bridge instead."
Ferris Provincial Park,diane allan,5,Awesome hiking trails
Ferris Provincial Park,R. Wayne Geen,4,"Went Thanksgiving weekend; not many other campers there (fair number of RVers on electrical sites, but not many campers on non-electrical). Some nice walking trails - very scenic!"
Ferris Provincial Park,Corrina D'Ambrosio,3,Beautiful little park! Really disappointing that they dont have a beach however its completely understood why they don't. Little town of Campbellford nearby is a must see area. The suspension bridge on the parks grounds is not nearly as long as anticipated. A cute park to spend a night or two nonetheless. 
Ferris Provincial Park,Lou Yi,4,"The trails are easy to walk.  Recommended people to walk trail which is at the side of cliff (muddy @ rainy day).  It's safe because it's fences along the edge of cliffs.  
In the park, there's lookout that is near the falls.  
And ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Dave Vernon,5,Great hiking spot. Watch out for discarded  fishing hooks on the rocks. Small playground. The bridge over the river is a lot of fun.
Ferris Provincial Park,Maggie Mulroney,4,Clean spacious campsites. The hiking was great as well. Only downside is no swimming !
Ferris Provincial Park,A Greenly,5,The suspension bridge was an experience i wont forget!
Ferris Provincial Park,RV Traveller,1,This park is nothing more than large cleared areas in the bush. Most sites are muddy. There was evidence where vehicles had been stuck in the sites. The roads are very potholed and dusty. There are 150 site and only one shower for men ...
Ferris Provincial Park,Trevor D,4,Our camping spot was decent. About half of it was shaded which was good enough for us. The highlight for me though was going down into the river and jumping from the top of the water fall. Walking along the rocky shallow part of the ...
Ferris Provincial Park,Monika Zhong,3,Only one shower head for women in the entire park...
Ferris Provincial Park,Bibaswan Ghoshal,4,The views from the Ramsey Gorge Suspension bridge are awesome. You can see a lot of turtles. The suspension bridge and walking trails are nice.
Ferris Provincial Park,Robert Cox,5,"Great place to visit and the price was excellent (free). Lots of walks, places to picnic, fishing from the bank and a boat launch area suitable for smaller craft."
Ferris Provincial Park,Lisa Noway,5,I love Ferris! The campsites are big..they're private and there's grass!! No dirt! The view from the top is breath taking!
Ferris Provincial Park,Avis RavenChild,5,I have so many memories of this place! Great hiking trails with some that you really have to look for that are off the beaten trail. Amazing camp grounds and amazing wildlife!

Ferris Provincial Park,James Kirby,4,Love the trails and the bridge leads to the Locks which is a nice walk with the family to see and experience some free fun of seeing a boat traverse the system.
Ferris Provincial Park,Ravi Uthayakumar,5,"Had a great time camping here. I was originally supposed to camp at Darlington Park but due to unforseen circumstances, I had to switch. 

This place is a nice quiet family friendly site to go with friends or family  

The Park Ranger s ..."

Ferris Provincial Park,Marilyn C.,4,"Beautiful place to walk around, bike or follow trails. Also see the giant two dollar coin."
Ferris Provincial Park,Linda Jeffrey,3,Quiet settings. But very dated facilities. Only one shower and only located at upper camp grounds. 
Ferris Provincial Park,Kristen Osborne,5,A quiet little park with some great hiking trails and private campsites. Perfect for a weekend getaway.
Ferris Provincial Park,Gill Clark,4,The service was great but there wasn't much to much to do in the park itself. Also I got 48 bites in 2 nights. More mosquitos than usual
Ferris Provincial Park,Ronald P,5,"Suspension bridge is the highlight. It moves a bit, not for those who get dizzy"
Ferris Provincial Park,Charles Ip,4,Great views near the river. Trails are easy but markings sparse.
Ferris Provincial Park,e H,5,"Peaceful, quite, soothing place, perfect for meditation."
Ferris Provincial Park,Larry Cassibo,5,The staff are way out there to help.quiet and clean.just about every site has privacy. If you dont mind the odd critter. Had a doe and 2 fawns lay down for a night 15 ft behind me.And of course racoons do what they do
Ferris Provincial Park,Anthony Slack,3,"Good large, large campsites. However, only two shower heads for the entire campground "
Ferris Provincial Park,George Zed,5,Suspension bridge is small but a great place to check out the rapids below.
Ferris Provincial Park,J Hobson,2,"We thought we would really like this park because of it's proximity to Campbellford and the Trent Canal. However, we did not make the connection that a campsite at the very top of the hill (site #39) meant constant wind and pretty much ..."
Ferris Provincial Park,Vibin Vincent,4,"Nice Camping site ,But has only one shower in the while area,"
Ferris Provincial Park,will wilson,3,It's a nice quiet park at night. The  lack of any real privacy at the camp sites does detract from it. All the hiking trails can be done in one day. The suspension bridge offers some nice photo opportunities. 
Ferris Provincial Park,Brendan Killeen,5,Great trails and close to Campbellford which offer some great shopping.
Ferris Provincial Park,Doris St Pierre,4,Love the bridge
Ferris Provincial Park,Tim Woytowitch,5,Awesome family camping :) so many bunnies in the park :)
Ferris Provincial Park,Wayne Lee,4,"The waterfall was tiny.  We loved walking on the rock river bed and suspension bridge.  Besides that, there wasn't much to do.  I believe it's a great retreat spot for the locals, but we drove all the way from Toronto so it wasn't worth the trip."
