Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Nick Maddox,5,"It's not the biggest or best equipped of the Ontario Parks, but it's a beautiful little gem and absolutely worth a visit if you're nearby."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Kelly Turner,2,Clean rest rooms. Must buy their fire wood unfortunately it’s very expensive and super wet! Kayak rentals available. Nice hidden paths where you can dock your kayak and go for a small hike.  Small selection of items to purchase in store ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Courtney McCarthy,5,"One of my favourite parks! Very family friendly. Private sites, large areas for camping equipment. Great swimming and easy Portages. Definitely recommend!"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Bill Aubrey,4,"Nice simple camping. Park is nice, offers some hiking and swimming. I stayed as far from the highway as possible and still could hear trucks, but it's a problem with the location, not the fault of the park or it's staff. Great for a quick camping fix."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Kevin Sullivan,5,"This is well run great little provincial park! We had an amazing site where we could swim right off of it, the weather was sweet, and our neighbours were all quiet & respectful of others! It all added up to an awesome camping trip!"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Nat Ouellet,4,"Nice camping place, especially when looking out onto Black Lake where you can hear the lovely loons' calls. Small beach right in the park. Water is refreshing. You can rent canoes etc. Park office sells Keurig coffee and the usual (ice, ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Adam Baran,4,"Just returned from a pleasant family camping trip. Stayed on site 98 which is great close proximity to the only running water comfort station in the whole park and a short walk to the second beach (which, in our opinion, is the better ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Kerry Brammall,4,I LOVE this park! The walk-in camp sites offer more privacy. Be warned there is only one washroom facility with running water the rest are out houses. The hiking trail is nice and the air is fresh!
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Scott Howells,3,Like all Ontario Provincial parks it is well maintained. With well kept bathrooms and Beaches. Problems are that privacy of campsites is level or two less then what they rate it and campsites near Lake can here excessive boat traffic. Sound travels around campground.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Dave Miller,5,"Great swimming, great fishing, nice play area for the kids. 
This is a second trip here and last time it was awesome as well as this time. 
Only downfall is campsites are a little close not alot of privacy."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Cheyanne M,5,I absolutely LOVE this park. I live closer to Toronto and the 3 hour drive here is worth it every time. If you don’t like a crowded campground I recommend going during the week as apposed to a weekend. If you want a good “premium” site ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,S Bertrand,3,"July 20th 2018 Nice park, clean and beautiful beach. We had campground 80 and it very nice, semi private and lake view. We have 2 young kids who like biking and play outside (it’s camping!) and some cars are driving very fast ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,John Crossley,5,"This park has it all, great staff, super clean, and a lake if you fish just right, you can get a nice big, 
5-8 lb Walleye.  
Too many bass, so fish deep.  
If you're interested in nature,  walk the trails, you will not be disappointed. ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Andrew Kim,4,"Black Lake was very quiet and calm. Most people canoed or kayaked, and I have only seen few small motor boats on the lake. Canoe fishing on Black Lake was excellent, and I managed to land a number of smallmouths (one of them was 18” ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Jamie Johnston,1,"If I could give less than 1 star I would !. The beach area is terrible and the park wardens are on a power trip ! There was 3 of us sitting around the fire talking, we had no music on at the time. We told them we were going to bed and ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Carla Devlin,5,beautiful day and a great night under the stars.Nice clean well kept park .great staff very accommodating.

Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Marcel Mason,5,"Quiet, great scenery, clean campsites, decent fishing - can't ask for much more than that :)"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Craig Currier,4,Excellent! First time camping as a family and it was an enjoyable experience. Average privacy lot was quite probate and a very good size for a reasonable price.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Lavy Kot,5,"Appart from the caterpillar invasion, this is a remarkable campground with isolated sites, trails to discover and beautiful clear lakes to swim in. If you're camping, the toilets are rustic (they do have running water and there is ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Prairie Beath,5,"Good service, high quality camp sites, well taken care of, low noise, nice hiking and beach areas, cheap rentals. overall a great place!!!"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Scott G,3,"July 16th, 2018. I am writing this while actually camping here. Nice spot, clean and well maintained, like every other Ontario Provincial Park I have camped at. Beach is beautiful but sites are hit or miss in terms of privacy, but that ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Waltz,3,This park is located very close to the highway so it can get very noisy. There are some cool walk in campsites that are pretty private.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Dane Merritt,5,BEST park in ontario :) we go once annually at least. more if we can
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Anton Vachaev,3,Small provincial park with many campsites cramped together. Don't expect any privacy unless going during the slow season. The worst part about the park are the rangers who patrol the campsite like it's the war zone. They think it's their ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Jwh Jwh,5,"A perfect spot for dogs, hikes and swimming, and this is the perfect time of year to go"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Apple House Art,5,Such a fun place
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,D Wehr,5,Great swimming and waterfront camp sites.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Sherri MacDonald,1,"Very small and infested with tent caterpillars as previous comments suggest. Most offputting is staff; the staff are the rudest, most unhelpful crew possible. Whoever manages this park needs a wake-up call!!"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,R3N G.,4,"Great park, a little loud with the highway so close but otherwise great staff and a good experience. One crazy hill to get to the boat launch on Sharbot, beautiful lake though.

The beaches on Black Lake were clean and the fishing was ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Kạịley Scott,5,Water is nice trees are real
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Joanne Wilson,3,"Short stay, good for weekend!."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Anton Dimitrov,5,Always great! Great location! Great staff!

Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Kevin Kilius,4,Nice little park off the highway
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Stephane Therrien,3,"Only been once, but as far as provincial parks go, we were not impressed. The beach was terrible and the site they're put us on was sinking in. That year was not a wet year either. We never went back as there are many others great provincial park in Ontario."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Jason Doherty,5,New spot and more importantly a great weekend of relaxing and getting back to nature.  Love this park and it's more than my first time up and would highly recommend this place to anyone that wishes to visit. The further in you go the ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Shawn P,3,"The park itself is beautiful. Both lakes are really nice. The staff at the park entrance were nice. 

Our largest gripe was how loud the traffic was. We're not overly picky and we live fairly close to a highway, but wow is it ever loud. ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Tim Morin,5,"Beautiful park, gorgeous lake. Always worth a visit :)"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Justine Davidson,4,"Great place to go camping. Fire wood is expensive and always wet but not a bad spot for a relaxing weekend. You can rent canoes, kayaks and paddle boards which is pretty cool. "
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,will billingham,4,Quiet clean and the staff are great
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Shawna Bourke-Heimpel,2,"We were camping with young children. Park clean, beautiful with friendly staff with the exception of Park Warden. We received a warning for being too loud and was told we would receive big fines if we didn't tone it down. Realizing what ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Angela Penfound,3,"Beautiful Park. Lake was clean and warm. Staff were friendly, and we felt safe. Two issues we had were that the wood they sold us (5 bags at different times) were rotten and wet... So an expensive nonexistent fire was had, and the sites ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,kkhazabi,2,Too much noise from hwy 7 . No firewood provided . Not very clean . Many dead trees that may fall anytime .
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Don Wilcox,5,"Beautiful provincial park with nice mix of camping options. We usually camp up on the ridge, as it's a bit more isolated and several premium sites are a bit more secluded from the madding crowd. Nice beach area, hiking trails. Shower/washroom houses down in main campground have always been clean."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Stephen Switzer,5,Had a wonderful stay. Camp wardens patrolled often so everyone was nice and quiet. We were asked to keep it quiet but it was almost 11:00pm and was totally justified and the warden was polite. Met lots of wonderful people in neighbouring sites and had a wonderful time. We are all ready planning on returning next summer.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Jason Laughlin,4,"Nice place but a bit hilly depending on what side you stay on. Plenty of things to see, mother nature at it's finest."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Chris Schell,3,Ok park
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Ziad Choucair,4,Close to nature you have a lovely water site of the sharbot lake and BBQ area. The park is also equiped with canoeing activity area and a small beach. Ideal for promenades and a quiet stay on the camping site.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Megan and Mike Kingston,4,Some really nice spots and a great couple beaches.  Just beware of how close you are to HWY 7
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Sabrina Martin,5,Great dog designated beach. Picnic tables and long sandy beach. washrooms and garbage can close by.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Jim Hong,4,"Beautiful place with lake and islands. Good for kaya, canoe. Beautiful Hiking Trail. Facilities are old. Nasty bug nest along the trails. It is in the middle of May, a lot of mosquitos."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Tim Ouimet,5,Stayed at lot 73 with wife and our two teens. Spent 4 nights. Campsite was beautiful. Walked entire area including marked trails. Very very beautiful. We travelled with our shitzhu who loved the squirrels and chipmunks. They'd eat right ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Dubravko Zgrablić,5,"We've been here many times and we keep on coming back.  The nature is pristine, the Discovery Trail is a real gem - if you are a nature lover, you can't but enjoy it!"
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,James C Xu,5,"Nice park , easy to access small town. We don't want to cook. 
Beautiful scene. Only issue is the site we chosen close to highway 7 , a little bit noise during day time. But still a great experience."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,David Barron,5,Good canoeing.  Nice water front sites.  Clean. 
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,D L,5,"A Good small park. Excellent swimming beaches, nice playground for kids. most sites are small but well kept. Well maintained bathrooms with showers, outhouses are also clean and in good repair."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Nathan Penney,2,"Currently here at sharbot lake park, night 1 of 3. Had two warnings of ""excessive noise"" and we were already whispering. The next time the come by, they'll be handing over a $180 ticket. I guess we're not allowed to have casual ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Abe Greenspoon,5,Love this park for camping! Great sites. Nice to have access to rent kayaks and canoes. Also good fishing in both campground lakes. 
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Greg Cowie,5,"Beautiful day-use beach, the view out over the lake is beautiful. Right on Hwy 7, easy to get to and find. My kids loved the playground play structure also - which is on sand (so much better than wood chips)."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Darren Boonstra,1,"Unfortunately, the park wardens ruined our experience. Beautiful park, such a shame that the wardens feel the need to treat every guest as a criminal."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Ravi Danda,5,Looks beautiful!!!
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Zachary Leger,5,"Had a fantastic time here, weather conditions aside! Our lot was decently private while being just across from the comfort station. Great views. The beach is well maintained with very little aquatic vegetation to step on. I wish they'd ..."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Karl Peterman,4,Nice campground though most campsites are close to hwy 7 which can be busy with truck traffic through the night. Great lakes for swimming and paddling.
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,John Hancock,4,Dogs dogs dogs and more dogs Ontario parks needs to start thinking of separating out dog people and non dog people. It seems like it's become such a trendy thing to buy useless small mouthy dogs and cart them around everywhere people go ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,James de Boer,3,"Great sites, friendly park staff, but it is very close to the highway and the truck noise can be intrusive."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Cory Rogers,5,"Very beautiful campsite, lovely place to camp."

Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,D. P.,1,Went there for the long weekend with our kids and was harassed by park rangers from the second we arrived. They drove by us every 3 minutes then complained we were loud-our kids were playing beanbag toss!  Kids!!  During daylight!  As ...
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Alex Burrows,5,A hidden gem in Ontario. One of my favourite parks to visit. 
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,James Eaton,5,"Sharbot Lake is a family favourite - especially the campsites tucked in close to the beaches.  Many sites are quite private, and on the water.  Only drawbacks are some noise from the nearby Highway 7 on certain sites, and the steep roads in the park."
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,Phil Beaudoin,4,Not much shade. Full sun big beach
Sharbot Lake Provincial Park,frank heid,1,"Chose a different campsite. Racist, rude and will harras you every minute for the stupidest things. We hated our experience and felt discriminated against. Will.never go back here. Filing a complaint."
