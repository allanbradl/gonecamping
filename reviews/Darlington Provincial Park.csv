Darlington Provincial Park,Michael Walton,5,"We were pleasantly surprised to be able to book this campsite the same week. The park is well kept, washrooms and showers were clean. We loved how close to the water we could be at short notice. Love the radio free area so not to have to deal with partiers. Will definitely be back."
Darlington Provincial Park,Steve Paul,5,"First time visiting park. Spent 2 hours walking various trails and roads admiring birds and squirrels, plus taking in beautiful views of Lake Ontario. Picture shown is from shores of Lake Ontario overlooking McLaughlin Bay at sunset. Definitely worth a visit!"
Darlington Provincial Park,magicn3ss,3,"Not a bad park. Staff are friendly and helpful. Washrooms are well maintained and store has great ice cream. Sites are a good size too. Improvements that could be made;
Some sites are not private at all. Our site had a water tap in the ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,holiday season,3,"Darlington was a great experience but for a campground, I can't say it was as enjoyable as a place like Presquile or Algonquin. The main issue is how close it is to the train tracks. I live nearby a train line, so I was used to it but ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Krishna Shenoy,4,"Camping was fun! Great first time experience for me. Campsite was clean. Huge too. Public washrooms were decent at the beginning, but as time went by, you'd expect them to be maintained - but nope! Overall the beach there is good. Clean. ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Shawn,4,"First time camping with my family.  Park is nice, entrance is where you get registered and receive a map to the site you have paid for.  You pass by the convenient store before you get to the sites.  Fairly priced logs at $7 a bag, they ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Ryan Paul,4,Hard to rate since the park was only partially open. The trails were easy and the day use area looks really nice
Darlington Provincial Park,Ryan Cozier,5,Took my 3yo on his first overnight camping trip here. Wanted to stay local in case we had to bail out early. We had a blast! Great camp sites and super clean park. We will be back next season!
Darlington Provincial Park,Sandra Vos,3,"Be sure to stop at the Ranger office and purchase day pass even though the park is closed. They will watch you hang out and drive around and when you leave your car, they ticket you. No warnings at all. We didnt realize once park closes for the season, we still needed a permit. Expensive walk, but nice just the same."
Darlington Provincial Park,Abner Cotter,5,"Second time at this camp ground. Cool breeze coming off the lake even in the heat wave. Best thing about there is no raccoons. Can play your music pretty much all night (not loud of course) alcohol is allowed. The park rangers are genuinely nice people,very friendly and willing to help."
Darlington Provincial Park,Canadiana North,4,"41.50 to camp near a lake view minutes out of Oshawa.

A slightly hilly area featuring several moderately flat hectares of camping, this Ontario Provincial Park features two hundred and something sites, some with electricity and all with ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Reid Hopmans,5,Great little park close to the city. Not much good swimming tho.
Darlington Provincial Park,Kay Silva,5,"We were pleasantly surprised to be able to book this campsite the same week. The park is well kept, washrooms and showers were clean. We loved how close to the water we could be at short notice. Love the radio free area so not to have to deal with partiers. Will definitely be back."
Darlington Provincial Park,G Li,4,Perfect place to take your kids on their first camping trip.  I just wish there were more fun activities for kids.
Darlington Provincial Park,Laura Franks,4,"Couldn't believe there was such a nice little park so close to where we live.  Quaint, small but big enough. And obviously enjoyed by plenty of people.  Sites are well big enough, was quiet, and we enjoyed our stay.  Would not call it our favourite but we will definitely go back without a hesitation."
Darlington Provincial Park,Ed Muirhead,1,"$33 to park my truck on the site on top of the camp site fee. Put my pass on the post and my dash as stated. Wake up to a ticket that was issued at 3 am - ""not displaying pass on my dash"". Very strange as it was there when I woke up. ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Ken Barbe,5,"Clean, calm. Water was warmish & crystal clear. The shore is rocky & entry into water was rocky 2 meters. Then sand. Water drops off quickly. Couldn't have asked for a better day."
Darlington Provincial Park,Ricky Yu,4,"Nice small park close to Lake Ontario, with camping facilities.  Great for summer fun."

Darlington Provincial Park,Laverna Woodcock,5,"I would recommend this park. It has trails to hike, fish to catch and lots of areas to camp. The staff is extremely informative and friendly."
Darlington Provincial Park,Stephanie Kilbride,5,"Excellent location for visiting TO and surrounding areas.
All the facilities showers, water and electricity.

When we arrived after booking on line our spot was taken #34 and My Hubby is handicapped and we needed that closeness to the ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Steve Lortie,4,Really nice park as far as PPs go. Most sites are BIG. Beach is mostly small stone and not nice to walk on barefoot. A lot of trains pass close by but you get used to it. In a trailer anyway. Probably louder if in a tent. Daily events for children and a nice play area. Store with basics. Overall a nice place.
Darlington Provincial Park,Denys S,4,"Love this park, great for small or large gatherings, camping, there's a lake also so you just follow the trails that will lead you there. Be with nature for a while.. We've been having our Annual picnic there for over 30+ years."
Darlington Provincial Park,Marc Hahn,4,"Awesome campsites close to home. The only downside is the proximity to the highway, train tracks and the level crossing (train horns). Excellent beach and hiking areas."
Darlington Provincial Park,alexandre dusseault,1,"The place is wonderful, we were wondering why nobody's mentioned it before... Until we eared the train whistle... Multiple time... During the night!!!"
Darlington Provincial Park,Lisa Robinson,3,"Nice shaded, private sites. Beach is very rocky. Building sand sculptures is out. Need to walk about 3 meters/9 feet into the water before reaching sand. Recommend water shoes."
Darlington Provincial Park,Ayesha Abdullah,5,Loved that we could bbq near a bench and ate our food then sat by the beach side. The waves are pretty high in this beach compared to sauble beach. Water I'd also a little milky grey color. It is definitely a family beach. The downside ...
Darlington Provincial Park,Geoffrey Campbell,3,We were on site 226. Adequate privacy as the site is surrounded by trees and brush. One side of the campsite has a trail along side it and you see everybody who walks along it through the bushes. The site is rated for 30' trailers but ...
Darlington Provincial Park,Derek Lyon,5,"Had a great time, walked to the beach and saw the pioneer cemetery. 

Our dog loved his first time camping and we will definitely be back."
Darlington Provincial Park,Sharmila Parashara Bhattar,4,Very secured place to camp. Ontario Parks and OPP surveillance. Neatly maintained camp ground and most of the camp sites are shady all day.. :)  the beach is full of moss on the shores and untidy.. but the waves are the best.. we can have fun and the day camping site isgood too.
Darlington Provincial Park,Ammo,3,Constant trains all night long made it difficult to sleep. Site 311 was good for hammock camping.  The staff did a good job of policing the park.
Darlington Provincial Park,Sophie Perron,3,"Nice camping lots. Washrooms aren't the greatest and shower water was always cold. Staff was nice and welcoming. Told the staff my firepit was full and they came to take care of it.
If you're used to more quiet camping/hearing the ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Sefali Ghayal,1,"Staff need to clean the washrooms and the shower almost 1 or 2 hours. Showers were so dirty with tissues and other dirty stuff. But none one came to clean until 6 or 7 pm. 
Then Sunday night to Monday around 10am. Nothing were cleaned. ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,MADDAWGNETWORK,5,"Nice and close to home.
Nice walking paths, waterfront, and some easy hiking close by. 
Only downfall to this park is train passing occasionally."
Darlington Provincial Park,France Mathewson,1,"Absolutely do not recommend. We left the kids with the grandparents for the weekend and drove two hours to camp with three friends. The gate staff were really friendly but the rangers were AWFUL. They harassed us on our site, on the ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Mehdy Ajvand,5,Great beach and also amazing views. Good spot for picnic and camping
Darlington Provincial Park,Matt Gage,1,Staff are incredibly rude.  Security is way to overzealous.  Harassing families with children.  Definitely don't treat you like a paying customer.  Would never go here again
Darlington Provincial Park,Jeff Tremblay,4,"My visit was in late June.
The day park is okay and the staff are great people but some of them need to grow some balls. They have to manage the use of the picnic benches better and stop allowing 6 people to have 4 tables. One to sit on ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Fiona Murphy,4,Nice park. Large sites. Well maintained. Noise of the 401 hwy is the only negative.
Darlington Provincial Park,Lestie Downey,4,A nice park but washrooms are so far from our picnic area and should be a bit more central.
Darlington Provincial Park,Ramtin Kia amiri,3,"Beautiful place, nice beach but noisy for camping. The camp grounds are very close to railway and you hear the noise of trains and horn almost every 10 minutes during the night."
Darlington Provincial Park,William Eames,5,Great place to bring my dog
Darlington Provincial Park,Courtney Williams,5,Had a lovely Sunday walk with my family and our dogs.
Darlington Provincial Park,Allen Yu,3,Beautiful views.  Lots of comfort stations and washrooms.  But very noisy with the train horning every 10mins... It's unreal.  Don't camp here if you prefer quietness.
Darlington Provincial Park,crystal krammer,5,great spot to camp for a few days
Darlington Provincial Park,Amy Mcisaac,3,Nice place but the train runs right beside the park. It goes by several times during the day and several times at night and blows a very loud whistle. Very hard to sleep this way.
Darlington Provincial Park,Dan C,3,"Average campground. Convenient amenities. Lots of things to do for kids. Not so much for adults. Beach was kind of messy. Ok for families, but don't bother bringing a group of friends."
Darlington Provincial Park,Zia Formuly,5,Great open park but you have to pay $15 to get in which is understandable considering the amount of work they put into the park to make it great.
Darlington Provincial Park,Asra Ghazi,5,We went for camping for a night .Had an amazing experience. Clean washrooms and very secure place to go with your family.
Darlington Provincial Park,Alonzo Snapps,4,"Quite enjoyable place, when the weather is warm!"
Darlington Provincial Park,Robinson Carpentry Ltd,3,It's an ok park. Dont expect your typical provincial park out in the wilderness. The highway is loud and trains go by all the time blowing there whistle. The beach is ok for rock collecting. Not good for laying on the beach or swimming. I was there first week in September. It may be different earlier in the summer
Darlington Provincial Park,A Google User,1,"Got a day pass to go to the beach and we could hardly walk down to the water because of all the rocks jabbing into our feet. Water gets deep very quickly, not good for small children. Over all disappointed and wont be going back."
Darlington Provincial Park,Princ3ss xo,1,"Worst camping trip! 
Firstly, when you come in to register they will charge you $15 per night for any additional vehicles on site & as the staff will not inform you about it as to how many your allowed to have on your site & will charge ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,NEWFIE KIM,5,"Excellent camping, wonderful workers, it's heaven on Earth, it's the only place to go"
Darlington Provincial Park,Joanne Lyon,4,The site was great..very quiet.  My only problem was the biting ants..they were a nightmare but I still gave 4 stars because it's not the parks fault.  Bring lots of big spray
Darlington Provincial Park,lina acharya,3,"We were camping ng here for the first time. Not the first camping trip though. Not the best experience. Don’t get me wrong , campsites are clean and spacious,lake is not to far walk. My only problem was that I could hear highway and ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Rahma Izzeddin,1,"It was the worst park that we ever went to. The ranger there are so rude and racist. They started to harass us about other people’s garbage, that we weren’t even near to but, like the good samaritans we are, we picked it up anyways. He ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Christine Denis,5,Nice park. Beautiful views of Lake Ontario.
Darlington Provincial Park,Tarannum Mistry,4,Lovely beach. Perhaps too rocky not enough sand. Water is not so clean either.
Darlington Provincial Park,Sahra Bradley,5,Staff are helpful and very nice.  I will be returning.
Darlington Provincial Park,Leah Lee,1,Very small park. Skinny broken trees.. no privacy.. dirty washrooms& shower. Especially washroom cleaning time is way longer than other provincial parks. I dont know what staffs do in the washroom during cleaning time. Had to wait more than 20mins whenever they clean the washroom.
Darlington Provincial Park,Shawkat Khan,1,We were picking apples which were wasted in the ground and the security guy came and behaved like a racist charged us and threatened to fine. Very rude behavior.
Darlington Provincial Park,Julie Fraser,1,"Worst provincial park ever. If I could, I would give 0 stars. The water was thick and green with algae, beach was rocky and dirty, and the washrooms were so desgusiting my 2 year old refused to use them. Not worth the $14.50 for a day pass. It is worth the drive to...anywhere else."
Darlington Provincial Park,Tiffany Ellis,5,Love this place. Its great if your looking to enjoy some quite time. But I do think they should add some more things there for kids.
Darlington Provincial Park,Sarah TheBully Smith,5,I like it here. Nature to. We go for hikes.
Darlington Provincial Park,Ashvin Thanki,5,One of the loveliest parks for the day use. Highly recommended.
Darlington Provincial Park,Scott Coates,3,"This is a beautiful Provincial Park located on the shores of lake ontario. The unfortunate thing about this park is it proximity to both the 401 and the main train line that runs between Toronto and Montreal. From our campsite, we had no ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Al Chakaroun,3,It is a nice park not too far from Toronto. It is by lake ontario not so great for swimming since it is lake ontario however it is covenient for those who do not want to travel far and enjoy one or two nights of camping.
Darlington Provincial Park,Thuy Nguyen,5,Loved it ❤ I had the campsite right next to the lake and it was so nice! It's only an hour away from Toronto.
Darlington Provincial Park,LOKA DAMMUR,4,It is good place for camping!! But not quite though..you can hear train horn in midnight..wash rooms are o.k. not to expect cleanlines.
Darlington Provincial Park,Aaron Petrungaro,5,Very clean and well managed. There is a nice variety of fauna and flora. It's easy to forget you're close to the 401 and the city of Oshawa. Great place visit if you are looking for a natural environment that is in close proximity to Oshawa/Clarington.
Darlington Provincial Park,Brian Tessier,3,"Good camp site's. Security is annoying, pick on the wrong people. No radios.... but the Train runs all night and day?"

Darlington Provincial Park,Zachariah Hidare,4,Great place they just need to keep the bathrooms clean.
Darlington Provincial Park,Nicole Carruthers,2,"Nice beach and campground area. Decent campsites. Didn't get a chance to hike the trails. Didn't appreciate staff and OPP circling campsites hourly. They were not being helpful, but trying to lay fines for park infractions. I would ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Md Atiqur Rahman,5,Excellent location must visit in summer
Darlington Provincial Park,Pat Clancy,4,Good park good sized camping sites.
Darlington Provincial Park,Hamza Dollars,4,"Had to pay for entry which was $14, not worth it. No proper place to sit but otherwise the view was amazing"
Darlington Provincial Park,Guillaume Lavoie,4,Great park for a day trip from the GTA. The beach is not too crowded and the park was clean. The beach is a little rocky however.
Darlington Provincial Park,Adrian Hill Tobar,1,Employees extremely rude and accuse people of taking wood from the ground then force people to pay a 80 dollar fine and if you refuse they wait till around 1am after you’ve fall asleep to say you have to leave if you don’t pay. sounds like a scam to me
Darlington Provincial Park,GAIL S.,4,Nice place to camp that's close to the city.
Darlington Provincial Park,Piggy Barn,2,Seems loud. Party place. Lots of groups taking over park. Trains. Not a peacefull place. Sound not enforced. Used to be peaceful. Beach all rocks.

Darlington Provincial Park,KAJAN KUGAN,5,Good campground.
Darlington Provincial Park,Mike Hopkins,5,Beautiful sunrise that day!

The staff was friendly and helpful and the individual showers were nice and clean."
Darlington Provincial Park,Erik Mm,3,"Never gets dark at night, loud 401 traffic, louder train."
Darlington Provincial Park,Alex T,4,"A nice park not too far from Toronto. Don't expect to see too much nature, but there's some vegetation and the beach. Enough to make your picnic a little bit more than just a BBQ."
Darlington Provincial Park,JOE MONACHINO,5,"Very nice place for a walk, lots of wildlife, a great place for camping when in season."

Darlington Provincial Park,Leo H,5,great views in the winter
Darlington Provincial Park,bob anderson,4,"It's close to us, but also has easy access from 401. The park accommodates all rigs and is quiet at night except for the odd train. There is a very long bike trail running through it too."

Darlington Provincial Park,Jitendra Sagare,5,Very nice park facility with Beach
Darlington Provincial Park,Mark Ryckman,3,"Decent park, but every site can hear the trains passing near the 401. If you're a light sleeper, probably not the park for you. Beautiful shoreline sites available."

Darlington Provincial Park,mia amor,5,very nice place
Darlington Provincial Park,Andrew Jackman,3,Went for the day. Checked out the campsites and there are a number of nice ones but a number are very slanted. I guess my main gripe is there is no dog beach. That's a selling point for me.  We prefer sandbanks pp for that reason. However you can beat how close it is to the city. 
Darlington Provincial Park,Fassel Hussain,4,A beautiful sunset.. wide open and quiet most of the time .. i love the duck hunting area here.
Darlington Provincial Park,Shahul Hameed Akbar,4,"It's a great place to visit on a windy day, the waves are reminiscent of sea waves, but beware it's not always like that. There's an entry fee for each vehicle, $14 for day pass. I think it's the fee that keeps this park not very busy compared to others."
Darlington Provincial Park,Susan Iglesias,1,Very disappointed with management and rangers. We booked 10 sites for an event for the weekend. Rangers need to learn how to talk to individuals and not insult them.  Our site was targeted the whole weekend by rangers. Next year we will ...

Darlington Provincial Park,Luis Solis,1,"To much noise, i do not sleep for two nights, train is to close"

Darlington Provincial Park,Pablo García,4,Great place for hiking and biking
Darlington Provincial Park,SamiUllah Khalid,4,Awesome place!
Darlington Provincial Park,Hailey Batchelor,4,Well maintained and close enough to the city for a quick camping trip. Downfall is that you hear the trains and highway at night so you can't even pretend you're in the wilderness. Good park and staff
Darlington Provincial Park,Dave McQueeen,5,Will always have good memories of my visit here.
Darlington Provincial Park,Shelley,4,Very nice and well cared for provincial park. Friendly and professional staff. Nice beach and great trails to walk. Bike riding is a little difficult as there is a lot of hills.  The only thing that I didn't like was the train that ...

Darlington Provincial Park,Rex Richards,4,"Really close camp grounds. Good place to ease the family into ""the camping"" experience especially if they like their urban comforts. On-site store has a Keurig, camp cooking tools (stuff you would see in Canadian Tire such as forks, ..."
Darlington Provincial Park,Giovanni Mcleish,4,Nice place for walks and a mini get away. The camping looks good as well. Nice trails to walk and take in a lil nature. 
Darlington Provincial Park,Saerro Fox,4,"Bring shoes to go on the beach with, because the rocks will hurt the hell out of your feet otherwise"

Darlington Provincial Park,Ashley Kingsland,1,The worst provincial park hands down.

Darlington Provincial Park,candy corn joe 77,3,Ok but no electricity
Darlington Provincial Park,J Hobson,4,"Darlington Provincial Park was surprisingly lovely given our proximity to the 401 and major cities. What we liked: Large sites, easy to move about with truck and trailer; the radio free zone, which made listening to the cacophony of bird ..."

Darlington Provincial Park,Ginger Godin,4,Love being right where I can hear the waves  on the lake
Darlington Provincial Park,Abdulaziz Hedaib,4,"Great place for barbecue, specially for families. There's also a camping area for those with RVs. Clean washrooms are on site. There's also showers. It's usually crowded on the weekends. You'd better buy everything you need because the grocery store is not that great."
Darlington Provincial Park,Donald Yap,4,"Great quick get away from the city. Only half hour away, or an hour with traffic. Nothing too special about the park, but being so close I can't complain."

However it is typically clean and we'll maintained and we still come here often when we can't get further from home. "
Darlington Provincial Park,Dan D,4,Very good place for BBQ and recreational fishing. They offer free fishing lessons and fishing gear.
Darlington Provincial Park,Jay Walker,2,"The good is that if you are in town on a busy weekend, there will still be sites available here and it's much cheaper to stay this way than in a hotel.  The bad is mostly related to the noise.  First there is the train noise - the trains ..."

Darlington Provincial Park,TWalwaski,5,The last bit of goodness left in south oshawa
Darlington Provincial Park,Marie Maillet,1,It's a money grab! Dropped off and picked up a trailer for family member that were there for a wedding! They only allow you 20 minutes to drop off or pick up which took 15 minutes to find as they didn't give us a map plus to unhook it ...
Darlington Provincial Park,Kavitha Raiker,5,Had a wonderful bday celebration @their picnic spot. Well maintained!.

Darlington Provincial Park,Dave Vaughan,5,Beautiful location
Darlington Provincial Park,Natalia Korobenko,5,Great place for camping and for day use! Campsites are separated by the trees and bushes which gives you a privacy and pretty spacious. Showers and washrooms are clean and have a good access from almost every campsite.
