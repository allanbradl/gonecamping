Bass Lake Provincial Park,Romit Maity,5,"Amazing, picturesque and tranquil place to spend some quality time. This place definitely warrants a visit during the early and mid fall time frame. The foliage and colors hugging along the shoreline of the lake is really worth the trip. ..."

Bass Lake Provincial Park,Acadia Alexis,2,For starters I was put in a crowded place. No privacy . The beach was too far. And once we finally got there it was way too over crowded. The washrooms were desgusting. And the half decent ones were all the way on the other side of the campground

Bass Lake Provincial Park,Joe Green,5,Peaceful. Lots of space between sites.
Bass Lake Provincial Park,Nicole D,2,Ridiculous to charge 13.00 for extra vehicle on your site. It's paid for why the need for extra charge. Doesn't the government make enough money off of us? A friend came to visit for 1 hr. And received a 30.00 parking ticket.  Meanwhile people from outside were able to park and walk through the park for free.
Bass Lake Provincial Park,Josh Wolfe-Maxwell,4,"Went paddling. 1 kayak, 1 sup. Bay to the left of the boat launch very nice and calm, but basically everywhere else the waters were suuuper choppy. Wind was estimated at 13kph, so FYI there.
