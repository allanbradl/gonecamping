Driftwood Provincial Park,Alexandre Thibert,5,"Beautiful park with many sites right on the water. Great for families or groups of friends. You can watch your kids play in the water from the comfort of your own site. Go for walks in the gorgeous woods, but do keep in mind that they no ..."
Driftwood Provincial Park,Cam Stevenson,3,"This is a tough one.  Many of the sites are gorgeous, but the park itself isn't (or wasn't, for us) particularly peaceful.  Seems to be a magnet for people who want to bring all of their dogs and party.

I'd give it a 5 if it wasn't for ..."
Driftwood Provincial Park,JayJay Jellybean,5,First time at Driftwood and it was beautiful. Very nice grounds. You have vault toilets which are glorified outhouses but with flushing toilets and a sink with foaming soap to wash up. They were clean. Then you have the main washrooms ...
Driftwood Provincial Park,Reborn Hammer,5,I grew up nearby. I love to spend time in the area. So many memories. Just like any place you might visit there are so many things to see and do. But since I grew up there I know where to go and what I want to do. Like swimming in the ...
Driftwood Provincial Park,Steve O'Brien,5,"Very clean facilities (bathrooms/convenience stations are well maintained), easy access to the water from most sites (Ottawa East site). Fire pits are all very new and have a removable cooking grill. Our site had good privacy, but some ..."
Driftwood Provincial Park,TheArchaeus6,5,"Despite a rough start with noisy neighbours, it turned out to be a great trip thanks to the professional warden who handled the complaint perfectly. Both sides were offered options in order to satisfy and everything worked out. The sites have a great view of the river and the staff are very friendly and helpful."
Driftwood Provincial Park,Devon Bradley,5,Very clean. Great staff. Absolutely love this park and expect to be returning several times over! William at the office was extremely melt helpful and very professional.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Ryan Cybulski,5,Always love going there. Nights are awesome. Place is scary quiet. Staff are very polite. My wife and son love this place as well.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Steve Bogensberger,5,"Very nice, smaller provincial park. The staff were all very courteous. Getting last minute supplies were a short drive away from the park; about 10 minutes to Stonecliffe or 20 to Deep River."
Driftwood Provincial Park,japca,4,We just drove by but I'm sure it's a great place
Driftwood Provincial Park,Jerry Maher,4,Was in site 55 which was private on the waterfront however very windy. Just a little maintenance needed in the washroom and beach or I would have given 5 stars
Driftwood Provincial Park,Mike and Mary Champagne,5,Only suggestion is we would like to see a quiet area for senior citizens.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Richard Luu,5,Great park with scenic view of the Ottawa River.  Clean bathrooms.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Kenneth McComas,4,Small sites. Clean. Nice beaches.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Ken Coupland,3,Just in and out ...but it looks like nice site
Driftwood Provincial Park,Mark Lanctot,4,"It's the views that sell the place.  Amazing views from campsites in the Ottawa East and Ottawa West campgrounds.  Almost all these campsites are waterfront, some with their own section of beach and most with their own canoe or kayak ..."
Driftwood Provincial Park,E Manu,5,Beautiful camp sites with a beach
Driftwood Provincial Park,Laurie Lafontaine,5,Fist time here very impressed! Beautiful waterfront sites! Good size lots! Good fishing right of your site! Nice beach area...will definitely be back!
Driftwood Provincial Park,Adam Eastman,2,Trails need to be cleared and marked better. Staff were less then friendly. Only one comfort station for the entire park and not very central to all campgrounds. People smoking in vault toilets. 
Driftwood Provincial Park,Francois Malette,4,Great place to stay. We had a spot right near the water. Only drawback was the sites are close together and do not offer much privacy.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Dill pickle,4,Great place. Good clean facilities lovely view.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Pascal Dupuis,4,Very nice place for camping. Waterfront sites with no services and lots of sites up the hill with two services.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Jennifer Dunlop,5,Love this place.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Jeff,4,"Beautiful park, nice walking trails. Far too expensive for a site though. Hard to justify spending over $130 for a couple nights out in the woods.

The wood is terrible that they make you purchase though. I've had 3 bags and all have been wet wood. Does not make for a good campfire."

Driftwood Provincial Park,Heinz Schmidt,3,Amazing
Driftwood Provincial Park,Scott Cunningham,5,Great beach sites
Driftwood Provincial Park,GD AM,5,We drove up from North Bay for a day hike at Driftwood Provincial Park during the off season in October. The gate was closed so we parked outside and just walked in. It was a short walk on well maintained roads before we reached a ...
Driftwood Provincial Park,Steve Lortie,4,Lots of nice sites on the river. Overall a nice park.
Driftwood Provincial Park,Ian Hooker,5,"Incredible sunsets and campsites right on the water.  The bugs, however, were ferocious and the blue, green and yellow hiking trails need maintenance that has obviously been deferred for years."
Driftwood Provincial Park,diesel Syndrome,4,Great park.  Had an issue where my camper wouldn't fit onto the site it was posted for.  I'm glad they fixed this issue for 2017.
Driftwood Provincial Park,The Hicklings,5,"Park is quiet, small (only 80 sites), excellent swimming and fishing and great views. "
