Selkirk Provincial Park,Piyush Ghimire,1,August long weekend.... We Went With Family and our 6 friends and their family. This place is not good for camping. Dirty Washroom. No shower in our side of camp ground. Staff are not friendly. We Just ENJOY because of big group. ...
Selkirk Provincial Park,Kaitlin Pierson,5,The park has some really private camp sites and it is well maintained. The staff are lovely and our kids enjoyed the art in the park activities. We will absolutely go back!
Selkirk Provincial Park,Branden McWha,4,A decent Provincial Park with the usual amenities. The site we booked had good shade and privacy. The beach was okay.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Remy Pravato,4,"Great camp sites, well maintained common areas/washroom facilities. Beach isn't maintained, very rocky, lots of dead fish/birds. Dog beach is actually nicer than the dog free beach, except for some irresponsible dog owners that don't ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Emily O'Gorman,2,"I am so disappointed with this park.  We arrived with our 5 year old for the weekend, it is so noisy all day!  The proximity of all the campsites not only limit privacy but also lack any sort of sound barrier.  When complaining, the park ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Alex Vorobyov,5,"Nice maintained park, quiet and shadowy. Beach is a bit rocky first 10 feet,  then soft send. Good for swimming and camping. Washrooms are basic, but it's not a Warldorf-Astoria, right?"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Vanessa Clark,2,"There is ONE COMFORT STARTION FOR THE WHOLE PARK. Unfortunately we had site #92, right across from the parking for the comfort station. People from all over the park drive to that station and there are lineups for the 6 showers. After ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Ed W. Visser,4,Close by for us (Caledonia) and there're always sites available. A quick getaway and much appreciated. Serviced sites have both electric and water. My only complaint: park roads can get to be very dusty. That's why I'm giving a rating of 4. We use 32' fifth wheel.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Gary Mariutti,5,"Awesome place, nice beach.."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Andrew Cruickshank,4,Nice park with waking trail through the forest and boardwalk over a river.  Beach areas had lots of open space for picnics and events.  There were a number of people playing cricket there when I visited.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Aleka Duguay,5,"Great Park! Clean and great size.. Just bring bug spray, ticks are in full force but it is like that everywhere right now. Staff was super friendly and helpful, gave us sufficient warning that our original site had flooded and let us pick our new site when wr got there. Highly recommend this park"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Nikitha Krishnan,5,"Clean, great spots for camping ! Loved the spot and the beach is awesome. If you want to go for a walk it's great for trails !"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Bob Wood,4,Nice park. People and dog beaches. Power and water sites. Friendly staff.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Gerhard Peters,4,Excekent park . Went there for the first time on Spetember long weekend. The only think lacking is a nice beach but that would not keep me from going back
Selkirk Provincial Park,dan booth,4,"Loved it.  It goes without saying, but bring bug spray and good t.p."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Ed W. Visser,4,"Always sites available, neat, clean and close by. (We live in Caledonia). We were in a 32' Fifth wheel."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Miguel Arturo Sierra ZÃ rate,5,"Very relaxing, surprised how detached from everything it feels even though is so close to town."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Rebecca Mills,2,"Encountered 6 blacklegged ticks around the campground, 4 of which were on our site. Not the most comforting feeling considering we weren't walking around in high grasses and such, just walking around the campground and our campsite. The ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Maria Yasnitsky,4,"Large sites, We stayed at the in a radio free zone. Loved the place."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Aileen Molloy,3,Lovely camping area.. beach not so great....slimy green shoreline mid summer

Selkirk Provincial Park,Avery MacLeod,4,"The bathrooms near most sites were sketchy but the 'comfort centre' was very nice. Not too many bugs, overall a good experience."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Professor Bhavesh Pandya,5,It's really a great place to spend weekend days here.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Erin Hesselink,4,"Nice little park, conveniently located."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Jeannine Kemmers,5,Beautiful place to go camping and a nice beach
Selkirk Provincial Park,Alyssa Keast,1,Big disappointment from time rolled in not much privacy between sites loud group beside us that security never told to be quiet bathrooms were few and far between and only one set of showers that they closed for over a half an hour the ...
Selkirk Provincial Park,Keith Villeneuve,4,"great campgrounds, the swimming area was not so great"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Jules Roy,4,"A nice park but lacks a nice beach, sites were fair sized, no clear flushable washrooms"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Chris Witmer,4,"Well maintained campsite and washrooms, beach left a little to be desired.   Bring sandals or water shoes as there are lots of rocks ."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Steve Brooks,2,Too many rocks at the beach. If you're looking for a good swimming spot... Don't look here.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Jean Winter,4,Quiet. No city anywhere near the park.
Selkirk Provincial Park,Peter Soliman,5,"Great park, the privacy on the camp site was outstanding, tones of big trees, great walking trails, beach was nice (though the water levels this year meant that there wasn't as much sandy space as I would like), and the staff were ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Bryce Schroeder,3,"There are many nicer parks to go camping. The sites themselves were fairly nice, and a decent size. But the beach was all stoney, the volleyball net was way to low, they ran out of water my first morning so we couldn't use the washrooms. Would definitely find a different campground. "
Selkirk Provincial Park,Kevin Gerger,1,Rangers are power tripping hard at this place... don't laugh past 9:30 pm.
Selkirk Provincial Park,George Hirsch,4,"Huge open sites nestled in among trees. No bad sites. Short walk to Lake Erie shoreline. Power and water good, bathrooms fine. Tricky to find/access septic dump. Water ran out Friday night of long weekend. Shoreline rocky, not sandy. People very nice. Would return in a heartbeat. "
Selkirk Provincial Park,David Dyck,2,"The beach wasn't what I'd call a beach more like a cliff with rocks. The ranges at the night have a hard on for a position of power so, they like to harass people at the slightest bit of noise. The site was pretty clean though."
Selkirk Provincial Park,jagdeep singh,3,Decent park for camping. One trail for hiking . Very Small beach and full of stones. Water is not so clean. For first time campers and people with children this park is good as they have children park too. 
Selkirk Provincial Park,Shirin Arabi,4,I've camped here two nights . The washrooms are limited ( the proper ones) only 3 for male 3 for female. They have campside washrooms more but they stink and there is no flash. But the showers are good with hot water. Good place for swimming
Selkirk Provincial Park,Anna Soliman,4,"A good experience. Our site was fairly private, with some growth between sites, and there's a nice walking trail. The beach was nice too; particularly the grassy picnic area, but there's not a ton of sand (unless the water was really ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Liam Doherty,4,"A small park that is pretty quiet. Not much for an extended stay, but great for a short getaway and to have a bonfire. Has one short hiking trail, a dog beach, a play area. Spots are fairly private, especially in the non electric sites."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Lesley Berry,4,"Loved the stay the beach not acceptable for people in wheel chairs or with a problem walking, very rocky."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Jessie Ventresca,5,"Beach is Rocky but swimable once you get further out. Vault toilets sucks but hey that's camping lol 
Really enjoyed my time here, campsites are nice, spacious & private, grill on fire pit, hiking. Will come again :)"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Chris Balanca,5,"Stayed here 2 nights.  Beautiful Park with a great view of Lake Eerie with just a 2 minute walk to the beach.  Our Canadian Geese would fly over our campground every morning and night, a truly wonderful Canadian experience! 
It's also just an hour drive to Niagara Falls!!"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Maria Cosme,1,Spent 2 nights here. Boring campground. They ran out of firewood on our first night and did not get more. The trail they advertise took 25 mins to complete in its entirety. Rangers were rude and unhelpful. The beach was disgusting. We ...
Selkirk Provincial Park,Gloria Stewart,3,Grass not cut ran out of water roads and campsites very dusty cars driving too fast stirring up dust
Selkirk Provincial Park,Sherri Tune,4,Wish cutbacks didn't affect their boat launch area!
Selkirk Provincial Park,Ian-Karen Warner,3,"Just returned from a two night stay. Site 135. Big site with 30 amp service AND water hookups. I think it's the only PP with that. The Beach is not great, very rocky and lots of seaweed. However, the park is full of mature couples during ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Madeline Sialtsis,3,"The trails and beaches were completely disgusting. It was just awful to be taking a hike and find more garbage than wildlife. 
On the other hand the staff was very patient with our huge group that we had on the group campsite. Pro tip: the washrooms near the group sites are waaaayyy cleaner than the next closest washrooms."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Valerie Ferris,5,We love taking the grandchildren and we always took the dog here until his passing. Now we have a new puppy to take to the beach and make some more memories 
Selkirk Provincial Park,Randy McKenzie,4,It is a great park but it needs better speed control and better pressure in the shower
Selkirk Provincial Park,Paul Fraser,3,"For us this would be a last resort destination if we can't find a place to go, but want to go camping.  Sites are spacious but next to no privacy (as far as camping goes) meaning there are no tree's or forest, its just wide open. They do ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Michelle McCulloch,5,We had a great long weekend camping at Selkirk! The grounds were very well kept and clean. Staff and rangers were very friendly and welcoming! We had site 24 and it was close to the bathrooms and water tap and was very private with lots ...

Selkirk Provincial Park,Andrea Wilkinson,2,"I visited for the day, checked out the campsites and the beach. The smell from the beach is horrendous. I would not swim in the water and I do not recommended it. However we did visit during a heat wave so that probably didn't help with ..."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Stewart Burnell,4,Park was awesome nice to see grassy sites only issue was the dog beach was really smelly dogs needed a bath afterwards
Selkirk Provincial Park,Alex Li,4,"Beautiful scenery, nice place to visit for a stroll and picnic"
Selkirk Provincial Park,Joan Simpson,4,"Had a great time. Sites were clean, large and private. Not at all noisy, even the many dogs who were there - there's a great dog beach - were quiet and well behaved. The beach isn't very large or sandy, but the swimming was great. A good place to go for a weekend getaway."
Selkirk Provincial Park,Derek Konieczny,4,Just returned from a Labour Day camping trip with our 6 year old.  Selkirk is a nice place for a family camping trip.  Its a small park so easy to walk everywhere.  The bathroom was clean and well kept.  The staff are very friendly and ...

Selkirk Provincial Park,Suzi,2,Ticks everywhere. Too much over grown grassy area's and there where tons of Ticks.

Selkirk Provincial Park,Hongxiang Shen,3,"(Translated by Google) The places where the cars pass through the park are dusty, and the roadside plants are covered with thick dust, which may have little to do with the recent rain. There are still people who speak loudly in the ..."
