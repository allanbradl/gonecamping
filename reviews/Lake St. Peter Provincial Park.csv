Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Tanya Borojevic,5,"Great family camping! 
We are at site 45 that has plenty of space and I'd say the best view.  Also close to a smaller beach for easy access for the kids. 

Main beach is great; spacious and clean. There's also beach volleyball as well as ..."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Rachel LaRocque,4,"A nice provincial park.
You don't need to book weeks ahead, and it's on a nice lake. However a few of the sites (the lower numbered ones I think) are close to the main road. It also has some campsites with amazing views of the lake. ..."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Wendie Hardaker,4,A nice beach & crystal clear lake. Very friendly staff. The sites are quite close & some are not private at all. If you have a large trailer it could be difficult to park. We saw a post get knocked over & trees hit by large trailers bring backed in. A quiet park but no place to properly exercise dogs.
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Darin Higgon,3,"A little too crowded.  Nice facilities though. If they cut down the campsite density, this place would be a much better frontcountry campground.  Campground beach is small but usable. day use beach is very nice and larger."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Bogdan Carjac,1,"The personnel didn't allow the second car being parked at the campsite, even if we paid ! We had to move it outside the campsites, somewhere on the entrance, in  the big parking lot. I understood, for some sites which are small just one ..."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,stephen Ward,5,"Had a great time the park is beautiful good hiking as well. Do sites in the 30s and 40s closer to lake. Sites don't have electricity, drinking water available, showers and bathrooms on site. Remember to buy your wood there can't bring your own or fetch it from the woods. Will be going back in the fall!"
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,TheAutoworks,1,"You can be as loud as you want. Party all night, the park warded will warn you once then you’ll never see him again. They shut the phones off at 11pm so no one can call and complain."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Alan Bristow,3,"A smaller campground, breaches look well maintained (not used as dogs are verboten). This time of year the trail (4k or 2.5k) had a lot of insects, which was a surprise as mid August, but the mosses and frogs explained that (very moist ..."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Dale Bolton,5,We love going up there it's so peaceful. I don't like going in the spring as the bugs are crazy but in late July on its gorgeous the fall colours are something to be seen for sure.
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Dean Brower,4,Very quiet park  small as parks go only 64 spots. Clean washrooms and best of all quiet

Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Cindy Grant,5,The camp was beautiful.
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Brennan McConnell,3,"Not the best provincial park by a stretch for those looking for privacy or fantastic trails. Really solid camp for families and car campers though.

Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,J T,4,"Pros ... Clean, friendly, nice lake, quiet (at least after Labour Day), big sites.

Cons ... not a lot of hiking or opportunity for wild life encounters."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Ali Hussain,4,It was good but I think the parking spots were not enough. Cellphones work there.
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,S Delmonte,3,"The only benefit of this provincial park is it’s comfort stations. The park had excellent washrooms and showers. The 3 hr drive north was not worth the camping experience. 
The park is surrounded by cottages and the lake was full of ..."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Graeme Parker,4,"So few bugs! Beach is very nice, water a bit chilly and not especially clean but certainly not gross or anything."
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Robert Meakins,5,"Absolutely perfect! Beautiful lake setting, nice treed sites, and no bugs!"
Lake St. Peter Provincial Park,Ashla A,4,Stayed here in August 2013 for three nights - very small park but terrific - we'll be back!
