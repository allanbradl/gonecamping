Fitzroy Provincial Park,Mark Bencze,5,Beautiful park with very large sites.  They advertise that they have water but they don't have actual hook ups.  It's a shared tap within walking distance from each site.  If in an RV you may need to bring an extension cord for your ...
Fitzroy Provincial Park,Robin Abel,5,"It can be a challenge to find your site, but this park has all the trimmings, and some really great sites for families. Modern amenities and good fishing...will visit again for sure!"
Fitzroy Provincial Park,Catalin Gruia,5,"Nice campground, the first one we went and it had no running water on spot nor electricity. We still enjoyed it very much. The site is clean and it is beautiful. The only downside is the poison ivy in many spots."

Fitzroy Provincial Park,adam trefry,5,"Awesome, great sites, just a tad muddy from all the rain lately. Each site has electricity plug, make sure to bring a long powercord. Clean water taps around as well as washrooms/showers. The sites are large enough to have 2 cars on it. ..."
