Balsam Lake Provincial Park,Okan Korsal,5,Very nice camping spot. Cozy sites. The faucets in the men's washroom at the Poplar comfort station needs to be changed. It's wasting lots of water and not hygienic as you need to hold the knob as you wash one hand. They should be ...
Balsam Lake Provincial Park,Devashish Arora,5,Very clean water and not too crowded. There are covered picnic areas that can be used. One can also book the whole picnic shed if there is a large group.

Balsam Lake Provincial Park,Stacy Crown,4,"Great park. Very nice beach with dog beach too. Our camp site was nice and private and had lots of shade.

Balsam Lake Provincial Park,Scott Targett,3,"Balsam lake is a nice park, seems to be getting a little run down. Park Rules do not seem to be enforced. The lake is very nice and clean.
