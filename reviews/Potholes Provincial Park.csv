Potholes Provincial Park,Melinda Shelford,5,"This place is beautiful!! I go every summer. There are multiple swimming places, many you just have to climb down to. There is a shallow area I always see families near the ""entrance"". 
If you want to hike, park at the lower parking ..."
Potholes Provincial Park,Tanya Circosta,5,"A beautiful place! A hidden gem that isn't usually suggested as a top 10 place to visit in this area. The hike along the trails is a lovely walk.  Beautiful scenery and a fun place to look for bears, but we didn't see any."
Potholes Provincial Park,Jessica Kirkwood,5,Absolutely stunning. Went for a New Years Day hike. Found some fantastic waterfalls - always on the hunt tor falls to shoot. The trail has great little lookouts along the way. Can go as far or short a hike as you want. Different parking lots along the way. Great start to 2019.  Can‚Äôt wait to go back
Potholes Provincial Park,m h,5,This is one of my favourite place to visit on the island. It very scenic and a great place to take a dip. Water is a little cool so go on a hot summers day.
Potholes Provincial Park,Regis Denefle,4,"Beautiful location. In the right weather you can swim, which is a great experience. Cool destination for a half day trip or full day depending on the time you have."
Potholes Provincial Park,Krysty McIntyre,5,I LOVE this place! Two good parking lots - first is free but second is $2.25 as of this review. I recommend getting the $20 season pass because you WILL be going back! The water is so clear and mountain water green in some places. It's ...
Potholes Provincial Park,Terzah Horton,4,Working on it.... we went to walk along the trails starting at one end. The trail was washed out and the visitors center didn't mention the problem. The only way we found out was from a woman in the parking lot. We then went up to the ...
Potholes Provincial Park,Steven Benjamin,5,Total hidden gem ! And pay the 2.25 $ to visit all the swimming spots up stream. 100% worth every penny. Ignore that free lot at you'll be walking up hill 1-3km to see anything cool like the pictures. It does get busy up there though so ...
Potholes Provincial Park,mindalynn frelick,5,The scenery is amazing and I love the hiking trails.perfect for a family picnic or a cool summer swim.
Potholes Provincial Park,Brett Goss,5,"Great spot to either go for a hike or just hang out by the water. It can get pretty busy in the summer, but it's nice and quiet in the off season."
Potholes Provincial Park,Nickolas van Wieren,4,"Very fun if the water is warm. I would recommend going to the third campsite, going to the river and heading upstream, there are many cool things and lots of fun cliff jumping spots"
Potholes Provincial Park,Anonymous,5,"I went camping near here a couple weeks ago and the staff were extremely friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. 

It was the best place I ever went, glacier like water. It was awesome üëèüèª"
Potholes Provincial Park,Naomi Ethier,5,Awesome at night for pictures of the stars! And awesome for camping and beaches :) üòç
Potholes Provincial Park,Michael Dearnley,4,A fantastic place to hike along the gorge and swim in the crystal clear (but cold) water. Only a short drive (45 minutes) from Victoria it makes for a fun day or half day trip depending on your pace.
Potholes Provincial Park,Cam Heathman,5,Beautiful area to hang out and swim for the day. Spent a few days here as a kid growing up. It's just as pretty now as it was back then.
Potholes Provincial Park,Penny Robertshaw,4,"Great place to spend an afternoon with your friends and family.  
The water is cold but that should go without saying. 
Not for anyone with mobility issues.
Be prepared for a light hike and lots of people in a relatively small pools of water, but it is definitely worth the trip."
Potholes Provincial Park,Kendall Elliott,5,"We biked past the campsite for a few hours exploring the woods, it was a nice bike ride. The pot holes themselfs are a real treat. I recommend going around the gate(or hopping over) and cheking out the old ruins of the resort they tryed to build."
Potholes Provincial Park,Chris tuttle,5,Awesome place to go swimmingüòé
Potholes Provincial Park,Chris Rozycki,4,"Beautiful place. Some trails closed. Trestle on galloping goose is currently closed (sept 13, 2018). Pay parking for the upper level parking areas. Bathrooms at each parking lot (typical porta potty style, not so clean). Well worth the trek from Victoria. Look for bears. Lots roaming around."
Potholes Provincial Park,Mitch Haslehurst,5,Gorgeous! The water is clear and cool and also very deep in some spots which make for great jumping from the rocks. Definitely my favourite spot to swim in the summer.
Potholes Provincial Park,Samantha Alexander,5,One of my favourite places to visit in Victoria! Lots of wild life - walk path ways - and amazing place to cool off from the heat not to mention the beauty of the place

Potholes Provincial Park,Alison Mclean,5,"It is absolutely gorgeous here. It's not AMAZING with exclamation marks, meaning it's definitely a nice place to check out if you are in the area but unless there's another reason this place might be significant to you, I wouldn't drive ..."
Potholes Provincial Park,Jehezkiel Eugene,5,"A short hike that leads to a beautiful, swimmable potholes and waterfall!

Potholes Provincial Park,Alioth Chen,4,A good place for water activities and with beautiful waterfalls and gorgeous canyon.
Potholes Provincial Park,Adam Gilbert,4,"We hiked the Riverside trail at the Sooke Potholes park. It's a nice trail with some really great views but it's not without it's drawbacks. 
Firstly, the trail in places leads up to the road and then you're walking along the road for a ..."
Potholes Provincial Park,connor9335,5,"Awesome spot for sun bathing and swimming (if you're brave enough to endure the cold). Surprisingly not very busy at certain spots of the river on the weekend. Sucky that they charge parking in the summer though, even if it's only like $2.50 or something."
Potholes Provincial Park,Robrigues Jones,4,The Galloping Goose Trail takes you from downtown Victoria all the way to Sooke Potholes. 50km each way. Mostly old railroad so fairly flat but also in Bush so only periodic views/photo ops on the way. The trail at Colwood is very ...
Potholes Provincial Park,LaVatta Frank,5,Lovely water to cool off and go for a swim and free parkingüòä
