Sandbanks Provincial Park,Jordan Toth,5,My favourite provincial park! Large park with all necessary amenities and a variety of activities. Always fun to hike through the dunes to find yourself a secluded beach spot for the day. Popular place so make sure you book in advance as camping spots are hard to come by!
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Avinash VK,5,"A great vacation spot for a weekend trip. The best fresh water beach that I’ve been to. Make sure to go on a non busy day. During that latter part of the summer, there is a lot of green algae floating around, watch out for that. They have some vineyards around the prince Edward county that are worth a visit as well."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Nathaniel Broughton,4,"Since I'm from Hamilton, I'm used to Lake Ontario being disgusting, green, and toxic. When on my vacation, I came several times to Sandbanks Provincial Park, and it was honestly great! Clean water that you can actually see to the bottom ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Adam G,3,"Sandbanks is generally beautiful, and I remember it fondly from childhood.  sadly, zebra mussels have become a massive problem.  while this isn't the park's fault, it does affect the visitor experience, so I cannot give the park the rating it deserves."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Jessica Brant,5,"Clean, cheap and good for the whole family. It's nice that it hasn't been over run with Americanized stores. There's one store, with minimal selection. the bathrooms are clean. The beach is also clean and garbage free. Sand is usually ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,K S,5,My family has been camping at Sandbanks since long before I was born. My grandmother started taking my dads family there in the 70s and we’ve been back every year since. We always pick a week in July. Although the booking process can ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Robert Onley,5,If you have young kids you really cannot beat Sandbanks Provincial Park given its massive beaches with shallow water that are absolutely perfect to allow your children to roam around. You won't have to freak out about whether the water ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Jeremy Dang,5,"This review is long overdue. Had a great time here. If you don't like crowd areas, this is a great place to visit."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Erich Shih,4,"I like the beach here. Water gradually goes deep and sand is fine, given that it is a lake.  What I don’t like is that there is no shower room for the public to use. That facility is only available for campers and not for day use. Other ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Kelsey Halagian,5,I had a great camping trip here with my cousin. There are 5 trails to hike and tons of beach area to explore. I seen people canoeing and kayaking down the river by the outlets. The beach was spectacular and great for families. They have ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Christina Diong,5,Beautiful long beach. Could be crowded during long weekend but not that bad.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Steven cowdrey,5,Great beach and water. Maybe one of the best I've been to in Ontario.  The only downfall is the price. $17 per car on the weekend we went. We visited dunes beach.  It had a nice little snack bar too and the sand is soft and clean. The water is shallow with a soft Sandy bottom and is  great for small children.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Jeff Johnston,5,"Sandbanks is one of the best beaches if not the best beach on Lake Ontario.  The entrance to the park is cheap at $11/car.  The beach is wide, sandy and very shallow water makes is safe for children to wade out. The park provides picnic ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Marilyn Minaker Roffey,3,Love the park which is why I buy a seasons pass every year for 25 years. Just came back from a walk on a trail to find a ticket on my vehicle for not having a pass. PARK PASS WAS DISPLAYED IN THE VEHICLE!! Office refused to revoke the ticket or help in any way. Great public relations guys. 👎.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,"Yuk Yu, Alison LEE",5,"Love this place! It gives me a pretty good impression at the gate as you get a sandbanks information guide and there are stories of family coming here for camping since 1967, now and then.  The beach is amazing. Clean and long coast ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,John Ventura,5,"Beach is a gem for Ontario. Large clean beach. Most of the beach is shallow and you can walk out pretty far before it starts to pass your waist. Safe for kids because of this, but there aren't any lifeguards so still keep an eye on them. Get there early to get a good spot and to avoid the lineups to get in."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Meagan Hull,4,We enjoyed this park! The beach was nice and the park site was nice and private. Thanks for a good time.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ottawa Calgary,5,"Caribbean too expensive. Too far. No worries. White sand beaches here will get you as close to a real beach experience. 

Parking limited."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Yuliya Koldayeva,3,"PLEASE, BUILD MORE & BETTER WASHROOMS.
The beach was perfect,  the sand was perfect, the water was warm the day we visited. BUT I decided to give only 3 stars because of the beach salubrity. There are no signs on the beach to direct you ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Beat Fanatic,5,"One of the best Beaches in Ontario,  great for kids and adults.  Nice silky sand.  Provincial park has nice campsites with all amenities.  Lots to do around there: horseback riding/fishing/hiking/boating/ Pictor close by for some ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Kathleen Brantley,5,Went here for the first time last weekend and was amazed! The beautiful sandy beaches looked like something from a vacation brochure not our Lake Ontario! The kids had a blast walking out on the sandbags that seemed to go forever. The ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Pascal Cayer,5,The inner canadian ocean! Ontario has a marvel that needs to be discovered! Sandbanks just like the name. You can sit on the beach and relax while the kids are out in the water playing. The water is warm and is so shallow that you can ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,JohnnyMC1973,5,"Greatest provincial park in Ontario.  Between the immaculate sandy beaches and the clean bathroom/showers it's really the best place to camp or just visit for a day trip.  The dunes are great for the kids, dune jumping is great and the ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Geoff Nash,5,"A beautiful beach which waters are warm and clear. It’s a great location to pretend being lost at sea, because you can seemingly goes miles off shore and still being able to touch the bottom. ( from perspective of someone 6ft and up) but ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Nat Artistry,5,My favorite beach! I travel 2.5 hours and absolutely love this beach! Crystal clear water
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Brad Straus,4,"One of the best beaches in Ontario!  Facilities are great.  Check in was slow after a long drive. Bothered me more than it should. Like anywhere, if you are picky about your campsite, be careful what you book.  We reserved late and took ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Shiraz Mama,5,"Outstanding customer service.   We were missing the grill from our fire pit.  Called the park office about it, and within an hour, they came to our site and replaced the entire fire pit.  Beaches are beautiful, and the water was so much fun.  Felt like being at the ocean."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Borian D,5,"Beautiful beaches, with very warm water. Incredible to discover and enjoy summer vibes in September in Ontario. This is a must-see."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,zlakam,4,"A place that made me drop my jaw. The sandy beach is just beautiful. It is clean, wide and long. A great spot where you can bbq underneath your umbrella (you must have one for a hot sunny day) and jump into the water. I would have given 5 stars had the water been clean enough to swim."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Carole Stephenson,1,"Very disappointed. No water at boat launch. Handicap shower in Woodlands campground not working Tuesday, staff right there notified. Not fixed, no out of order or closed sign as of Friday. Several people with mobility issues have been caught undressed before discovering there is no water! However the beaches are gorgeous."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Goo Pad,3,"This super small lakeside village offers fine-dining, award-winning wines, and some epic music and arts events. With its own stunning beach and a boardwalk that leads to a lighthouse, there's plenty to see in this quaint artist town. It also offers the best view of the Sandbanks Dunes."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Raman Lehal,4,Nice beach and park. Wanted to play volleyball on the beach but couldn't get anyone to play with. I guess that's not the Beach's fault but I'm still upset about it.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,J C,5,Wow ! What a nice beach. The people seem very respectful. Very clean. I was expecting cold water and it really wasn't that cold at all.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ale yotexplico,5,I love that park I really recommend go visit and enjoy the transparent water and warm
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ralph Cristofer,4,The place is great. There is a very long line when we went there but it is worth the wait. The beach is huge and well maintained. One only thing is that it is really hot when we got there because of the heatwave. The water feels great ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Sally Reese,5,"This location is a must-see for anyone passing through the area. It's a lovely drive through the county in the summer, and ends with a spectacular beach that's blue as can be and an uninhibited view of sand, sun, and sky. Go with friends and make a plan to visit wine country while your at it. It's therapeutic!"
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ranjeetha D'mello,5,"Love this place . We spent the whole beach day here this summer. Absolutely gorgeous and everything was convenient, easy to find and tons of fun."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Morgane Widmer,5,The beach is beautifully done the water temperature is perfect. Good place for a friends trip or for family! Small tip:  The dog areas are less crowded.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Josh Brooks,5,Great park but small sites and over packed. Only good for beach days
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Melinda P,5,Well kept beach and there's a dog friendly section. I highly recommend you arriving early as it does it quite busy and they do close the parking lot when it reaches capacity.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Trudy White,5,I got sand in places... Just kidding! It was a very nice place to visit.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Chloe Hamel,5,"The beach is amazzzzing!!! Beautiful blue water, white fine sand and lots of room. You don't feel crowded!! The water is clear and on the windy days theirs waves! So much fun! The water is not deep before a few 50-100 feet away, perfect ..."

Dune Beach is crazy."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Cory Major,5,An amazing time... The beach is incredible. My family and I really enjoyed our visit. Definitely worth coming back!
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Marianne Tardy,4,"Nice place, overcrowded in the afternoon. The camping spots could have  a little bit more privacy. The water is warm because not deep at all.  Great for a 3 days break."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,John Maier,4,This is a solid park with a great beach.  The park store was ok while the nature center actually had better items for children and souvenirs.  The quality of camp site varies greatly with some private and large while others in full sun ...
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Eric Dayman,1,"Going again end of August, sure hope they have repaired the access to the dogs allowed beach? Victoria Day weekend was disappointing for my wife and our dogs as the Outlet River washed out the path and the park rangers made a big deal ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Leah Chan,5,It's always great.  Friendly staff and clean facilities.  Love the white Sandy Beach!
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Jomari,5,Best beach I ever been in Ontario. The only downside is the parking. You have to walk to go to the beach.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Master B,1,The beach is beautiful. But not worth going for. No shower in change room plus parking is horrible. You have to climb up the hill to go to the beach and bring your stuff from the parking lot. Not gonna come back again.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Alan Randle,5,"Awesome a great time in the county. Sandbanks will not let you down. Water is always clean.. 3 different areas to swim, you have Sandbanks, The Outlet or the Sanddunes.. all have pros and cons, but if you want beach, sun and water.. they ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Julien Lamarche,4,"Belle plage!  Beautiful beach!  Washrooms were clean, although my wife tells me the changing rooms were not.  Got there by 9:30, still plenty of parking space.  By 11 the place was full.  Go early!!!!!"
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Adam Doerwald,1,"BEWARE of the overzealous Park Rangers.  They will milk you for cash knowing that most people won't be able to return to Picton to attend a trial.  When you get your camping/parking pass, you should probably make multiple, enlarged ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Al Iskandar,5,"I just love this place, Prince Edward county Ontario is one of the most beautiful places I have visited. You do not need to go to the Carribbean to enjoy the sunshine or the sandy beaches. The area is great for biking, camping, and wind surfing."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Cliten Rodrigues,5,Great Beach for families. Water is nice in the summer and is shallow enough for young children to wade. Very clean park and facilities.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Christian Marsan,5,Great beach near Toronto super clean !! Ill go again
Sandbanks Provincial Park,TheVolvotech,4,"We stayed for a week and the park rangers ware awesome didn’t bother anyone.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ramtin Kia amiri,5,The best beach besides lake Ontario. Nice and cool. I am driving about 3 hours each summer to use the beach.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Al Goddard,5,Always a great beach to go to...can get very busy.  Water always cold because it is Lake Ontario.  Waves can be hazerdous when a storm is near.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Raju Kallumkal,5,Gorgeous beach to visit. Lots of waves that are safe to swim in. Water is nice and warm on Sunny days. Hard to find parking - it can get pretty crowded.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,River He,5,Great beach! Like it very much! Will definitely visit again.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Justin Lalonde,2,Do not stay in 800’s unless you want to sleep in a field. I was supper disappointed.  Nice beach but that’s about all. First time here and the last time.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Philippe Bedard,5,one of the best water i've seen. I mean you dont believe you're still in Canada and way more Ontario. I really recommend this to any 1!!!!

Going back next year . Hot showers was the my teenagers favourite after a swim . Keep up the great job."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Fernanda Barichello,5,"We have been going to Sandbanks for 20 yrs. It is beautiful. You can pick chose  the different beaches ans you must check them all out. Wonderdul staff and everyone is friendly. Affordable well kept camping spots.
The only thing to watch out for is the abundant amounts of poison ivy. So Google what it looks like to bw safe."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,JustAli Petgrave,4,Beautiful place for a day trip with family.    Water is fantastic!  Not much shade and the concession  stands were closed. Overall it is a great get away.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,joyce vitelli,5,"Love it there, can hardly wait for summer!"
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Cathryn De Silva,3,Beach is great but we didn't see any bathrooms close to where we were so it was a shorter stay.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ibraheem O.,5,"One of our favorite beaches to travel to as a family. It's quiet, lots of open space, and much cleaner than 90% of other hangouts that are well known. Amole parking too so that's a plus."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Polina Galkin,1,"Beach is great... but beware of a scam if u dont know their law, doesnt matter where you're from.. no visible alcohol allowed. Even tho there are no signs, nothing on their website and nothing in the entrance..you ll get a ticket..125$"

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Aj Penney,4,Coolest beach I've been to. Cliffs of sand pretty cool.  Didn't go far from the parking lot but definitely going again.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Thalia Chand,5,Awesome huge beach.  Super busy with families. Go early to get a spot .  Parking right there along the road. $17 to get a pass for vehicle entry to the park . Nothing to eat nearby. 1 or 2 good trucks that's it. Most ppl take food.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Pirasaanth Kulendran,4,One of the best beaches but its better to arrive early... after 12pm line ups can be long and lot can be full.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,neel bhandari,4,"Fun , but when with little kids make sure they don't enter the water , it has random drop offs"

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ilse Franckaert,3,"You pay 17 bucks per car for a day pass

Go there with good weather. It was too cold for us as it also was a bit cloudy. 

Quite nice to walk around"

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Sh S,5,"Awesome beach, amazing shallow water , clean washrooms, will come back next year for camping!!"

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Diego Castro,5,Amazing place. Very good for families. Its clean and the beach is like the Ocean!!

Sandbanks Provincial Park,TD cantbebeat MoitionzZ RepzZ,5,Its only one of the best beaches in canada so if you dont like it then move to another country.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Patrice Collin,5,One of our favourite places in Canada for families. Amazing beaches and beautiful scenery

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Terry Lim,4,It is a big and nice beach with really fine sand. I wish they’d have shower.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Silvia Di Marco,5,A must visit destination...very enjoyable and beach is wonderful
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Wendy van Monsjou,4,Car camping is great in this park. The sand is white and soft and plentiful.  Sand bars run along the beach allowing you to walk a fair distance before entering deeper water.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Awesomebanana17 & Co,5,Love it clean and beautiful

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Steve Lei,1,"Sandbanks officers harassed my girlfriend shortly after our arrival.
I ended up with a false charge and have launched a complaint. It will be  a hardship to miss work and fight this in court hours from home, but it is my name. Shame on Parks Ontario."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,angelène,5,Who doesn't love white sand? It's quite lovely here :) I suggest going farther when you park because it's less crowded. There are certain spots of the beach too where you can get a bench-table; and that's great if you want to bring your own little barbecue/feast. I like Sandbanks because there are lots of trees for shade.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Norwood Leung,5,Great area and clean. Good for young families. I am glad you pay to go in because we are paying people to keep it clean.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Eric da Silva,4,This park is always a beautiful location to visit and camp at! The campsites themselves are generally well kept. But due to it's nature of being one of the busiest provincial parks in Ontario I feel that some of the facilities (ie. Washrooms) should be updated and cared for more often.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Jasmin R,5,Love this place! So many people from Toronto come here. It's worth the drive
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Faith Smith,5,They have the best beach in Ontario for sure! One of my all time favorite places. You feel like you're somewhere tropical when on the beach there.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Rachel Collyer,3,"Outlet beach is packed all summer long, so families will dig it. Probably the most developed provincial park so flush toilets and amenities are everywhere. If you're a couple or a gang who wants more privacy the sandbanks beach is a good ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Manushi Gera,3,Amazing sands and waves. Pretty full beach. Got a parking ticket for not displaying the pass when it was clearly visible as being turned the right side up on the rear view mirror. Not cool. Otherwise had a fun time with my husband. Very scenic.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Chris Boodhoo,4,"Nice beach, was crowded but that was to be expected.

Still had a nice time besides the campsite not being the greatest, taught me to thoroughly check campsites before booking."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Alexander Daunan,4,"The sands is smooth and silky. The beach is shallow near the shore, so it's safe for those who bring young children. There's also a cafe in case you didn't bring any lunch or breakfast. There are some washroom and changing station very close to the beach."

Sandbanks Provincial Park,D Pineault,5,"Great beach.
Sand dunes are a blast for the kids
Bathrooms and changing rooms by the parking area.
No shade though, so bring an umbrella, a shelter, plenty of sunscreen!
Get there early before the beaches crowd in.

They also have trails, camp ground, but I haven't checked those out."

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Shaker Ben-Saud,5,I felt I was in Cuba. Sandy beach for kilometres and clear water. Safe for kids since it stays shallow for long stretches. 
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Andrew Ness,4,"Beautiful park, good separation between most camping sites so you don't feel like your on top of the people next to you. The park maps are horrible though and are more like directions on a napkin than a proper map. The pet beach could use some garbage cans especially if you want people to clean up pet messes."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Farhaj Kazmi,5,A beautiful place to visit or to camp. The besr beach ive been to so far. Very well maintained and managed. Clean washrooms and many activities to do if you stay there for multiple days

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Michel Condoroussis,5,"What a beautiful beach especially with young children, even our 13 month old was able to crawl in the water and let the small waves hit him since it is so shallow and that way for a long ways out. There are washrooms and the beach is ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,mo mo music,2,It's so nice place especially the sand beach. But some of the staff are not friendly and unprofessional. I had a parking issue and no one wants to help me. If I ever want to come back it will be for the day pass only!! Not for the camping.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Barb Vogel,4,"Good biking trail to beach. Many wineries to visit. Reasonable driving distance to Picton, Bloomfield and Belleville. Kingston and the 1000 Islands is a good day trip. Only negative is that trees cut down at campsites have been left as stumps and are a severe tripping hazard."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Kikih Skye,5,"Great for a variety of activities. Great for hiking, swimming, cycling, roller blading.... Or snoozing. Varied landscapes make for an interesting outdoor adventure. "
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Keith Charabaruk,1,"Don't come here on the may 2-4 weekend unless you don't mind the noise from a concert at a house close by.  It's 10:05 pm, an alcohol ban in effect (which is fine) and ""no excessive noise"" signs around.  I just called about the fact that ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Steve Spindler,3,It is busy at times. You need to book a campsite really far in advance. Once the water level goes back to normal the beach is really nice. This year it is flooded

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Fernando Torres,5,Very good spot
Sandbanks Provincial Park,candy hoang,5,"The beach is amazing. Soft sand and clear, shallow waters. It's hard to believe that it's Lake Ontario.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Mark Ryckman,4,"This provincial park is absolutely beautiful, located on some natural sand dunes on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It is an extremely popular and busy park in the summer, so don't expect too much peace and quiet. Due to the large number of people, the staff often have trouble keeping up with cleaning washrooms, etc."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Serina Davi,4,"Good job by staff on Friday! While it was difficult for so many people to not have a campsite, they were polite and understanding throughout what looked like an extremely long day.  Too bad so much of the park was flooded by the rains."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Richard Wideman,5,Nice to go up for the day. Great beach with enough space for everyone
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Flora Pan,5,Going during the winter was a great experience. There were no people around and we didn't have to worry about parking either. It will be cold but definitely worth it.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,EAST 905 skims,5,Great skim edit: someone must have dug the outlet river through the beach with a backhoe completely destroying any skim there was

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Thelma Yandt,5,We camped for 3 nights in our 5th wheel RV. We stayed in the Westlake Campground which is set up very well. We liked that the grounds are planted with native plants and that the washroom facilities are excellent. Our site had more then ...

But the outlook beach with its white sand and emerald water colour is the closest ..."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Arun Vyakaranam,3,Will never forget this place in my life. My wife was almost drowned in the waters. There are some sudden drop points in the water well within the marked rope area by the park officials.  So watch out ! Especially those who don't know swimming.  Otherwise good spot for a picnic with families. 
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ford Anderson,5,In a word: Oasis.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Ivan Fedorets,5,"Huge white sand beach, beautiful hiking trails, ice-cream shop, you can easily live there for weeks.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Melanie Schawill,5,One of my favourite places to camp and be.
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Tiffany Cariaga,5,"Amazing beach!!! You'd never guess that it's Lake Ontario! White sandy beaches.  There are three to be exact: outlet, dunes and sandbanks.

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Shady Bee,4,Beautiful national park!
Sandbanks Provincial Park,A T,5,"One of my favorite Beaches in Ontario aside from Sauble Beach. The water is shallow and safe for kids, the sand is beautiful and soft. Its a outlet beach is the best and normally gets busy during summer weekends so arrive early if you want a good spot. There change rooms and washrooms close to parking/beaches."
Sandbanks Provincial Park,Shannon Essex,3,"The beach is beautiful, there is no doubt about that. My kids love to come hear and frolic in the water and build sandcastles.  We have never had a problem until this year.  DO NOT USE their outhouses.  If you have to go to the bathroom ..."

Sandbanks Provincial Park,Maxime Carpentier,4,"Great beach, the #1 beach in Canada in my opinion. The ""outlet beach"" is the cleanest of both. The bathroom at the second beach were horrible.
