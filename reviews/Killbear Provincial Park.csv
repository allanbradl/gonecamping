Killbear Provincial Park,Zo Verion,5,Killbear is an amazing place to go camping. There are tons of bike and hiking trails. The lakes and many beaches are beautiful and clean. They have unsupervised cliff jumping for the brave ones in your group. Those who love riding trials ...
Killbear Provincial Park,Dujana,5,"Can't wait to go here again. Magnificent views from many points. Huge trails did spot few black bears, there is lots to see and explore. The nights are incredible large view of the beautiful night sky its a must see park. Great for couples."
Killbear Provincial Park,Scott Spiegelberg,5,Spent my childhood summers here in the late 60s to early 70s.  Wonder if I'd recognize anything if I went back? Too bad I'm not into camping anymore (although I loved it as a kid).  Would there happen to be a Four Season's or a Waldorf Astoria there now I could stay at?
Killbear Provincial Park,J Rhawk,5,"It‚Äôs worth the drive.
We saw some deer.
The air is fresh.
Beautiful and quiet.
A good break from the world.
Meditation is key."
Killbear Provincial Park,Sandra Smith,5,"Beautiful park, well maintained, lots to explore for all ages. Areas for swimming, kayaking, hiking, motor boating and of course relaxing. I recommend you bring bicycles as the park is very big. Park staff are well informed at the ..."
Killbear Provincial Park,Denise Sakauye,5,"Best park to comfortably go car camping in. Lots to see, lots of trails and beautiful beaches. Very clean facilities too. Wide range of campsites, some more private than others. My family enjoys camping at Harold Point best. We will return for years to come."
Killbear Provincial Park,Scott Head,4,"Got to explore this place more next year. Beautiful and full of interesting stuff to do. Sign in process was super annoying though, especially after a 3 hour drive."
Killbear Provincial Park,Becky Irvine,5,This is probably my favourite provincial park after Algonquin. The park has been left to nature - its not all perfectly laid out and landscaped like some places. We have a great site (96) but next year might try to snag one of the ...
Killbear Provincial Park,Sherri Cooper,5,"I am in love with Killbear, I can't say enough about how amazing this park is. Its big and beautiful. The beach is amazing, clean and I loved the water. I meet lots of people here, one couple who comes from Germany every year just to ..."
Killbear Provincial Park,Mirej Milosevic,5,Killbear was our first camping experience and really wonderful. 3  nights and a whole lot of peaceful and amazing moments. A great way to disconnect from the city; the noisy roads and pollution. Sleeping in a tent at night was somewhat ...
Killbear Provincial Park,Mike Snow,5,"This park has some amazing sunsets. The beaches are also very beautiful, perfect sandy beaches for swimming and tanning etc. Fun trails on bedrock outcrops with stunning views. However you do sacrifice privacy here on site as there is almost nothing, if anything between most of them."
Killbear Provincial Park,Michael Giorgi,5,Great camping sites. Phenomenal beaches. Amazing coastline to be explored on land and on the water. Excellent hiking to grand vistas. It might not be Algonquin but then again Algonquin is not Killbear.
Killbear Provincial Park,Rollor Luo Le,5,"I visited her a few times, for day visit. It is lovely. There are beaches and rocky shores for you to choose. My favorite is  the rocky trails. It is much more fun than walking on a flat path."
Killbear Provincial Park,jogarayg,5,Really good if you're looking for a place to camp
Killbear Provincial Park,Willis Luong,5,Beautiful park. Nice and clean. Great beaches and hiking.  Can't ask for more

Killbear Provincial Park,Cesar Ruiz,5,"We come up every year to this amazing provincial park. Possibly one of the cleanest clearest waters you can swim in in Ontario. The park is full of wildlife and people here at this park are super friendly. 

Park have all the facilities you need like washrooms and showers, it's a great spot!"
Killbear Provincial Park,T T,4,Nice family camping resort overall.  Pros: sandy beach & nice look out trails.  Cons: there's not much privacy between the sites. Comfort stations (bathroom at lighthouse and Harold point need much updating) comfort station at Kilcoursie is the cleanest.
Killbear Provincial Park,Ben Davis,4,Always a great time. No bugs this time of year and we were not on waterfront.  Staff great . Would have given five stars except site was very wet and muddy due to rain.   Going back next year.
Killbear Provincial Park,Steffen Wiseman,5,Another beautiful park on the Georgian Bay.
Killbear Provincial Park,MJ Seguin,5,"Love camping here! Great lake views, sites are really good size. And if you're lucky you may see some deer and or bears!"
Killbear Provincial Park,Kosta Nesterov,5,Beautiful landscape. Amazing sand beach.Look out trail is just awesome!!!
Killbear Provincial Park,Michelle Shannon,4,They seem to have cut back on staff and it's noticeable. Shorter hours at the visitors centre and not every campground has a station open. The park is still beautiful and we'll definitely come again next year.
Killbear Provincial Park,Doug Smith,3,"This has been one of my favorite parks, but after camping across the US, Ontario Parks is really expensive for what you get. The Wardens rarely enforce rules, we had rowdy neighbors, the site had garbage on it when we arrived, and the ..."
Killbear Provincial Park,Mike Johnston,5,"Great experience. Lots of nice trails, Washrooms were impressively clean and kept in good order. Lots of drinking water taps around park. Saw some deer and a Moose calf.

Killbear Provincial Park,Chris Nowak,5,I love coming here. Beautiful scenery with clean water. Highly recommend this park. Been coming here for over 20 years.
Killbear Provincial Park,Manuel Centeno,5,My personal favorite place to camp.  Good for day trip or longer stay.  Cliff jumping at Harold's Point is probably my favorite attraction. Highly recommend.
Killbear Provincial Park,Al Chakaroun,3,"It is a nice park, good for hiking not recommended for family with kids, too many motor boats you can smell diesel in the water at the beach. The Lighthouse point is nice to visit, it is an easy walk in the park not much of a hike. The Bruce peninsula is a much bettter place to visit."
Killbear Provincial Park,Amanda Jean,3,This provincial park is nice and well maintained but the sites are quite close together and privacy was a bit of an issue for my liking. I prefer other parks within the area.
Killbear Provincial Park,kpheber,3,"Beautiful place. Georgian Bay is clean and warm. Most dog unfriendly of the many provincial parks I‚Äôve been to, which is sad because of the number of beaches. Trails in rough shape. Sites are close together and all sand / dirt (no fault of park)."
Killbear Provincial Park,Gerry McBurney,5,"Been going for 6 or 7 years now with a bunch of awesome people. 
Great place for adults and kids alike."
Killbear Provincial Park,Bettina Cochrane,3,Sites are close together and on the weekend it seems to be party central. Wardens didnt seem able to get control of the ride drunk who kept us up till 3 am both nights. Only a few trails available but they are stunning.
Killbear Provincial Park,Amir Hasheminasab,5,Couple of days camping . Very beautiful park with different views and clean beach . The beach is perfect specially for small children because of shallow clean water. Clean washrooms. Even small one was clean .open fire prohibited due to ...
Killbear Provincial Park,Kim Macdonald,3,"Lovely park. Stayed in the Georgian campground which was radio free. Staff was very helpful, beach was close, breath taking views, but be prepared to share with 50 other people at the same time. Park is very large, so you do have to drive a lot to explore. Great visitor centre."
Killbear Provincial Park,Liane Vaz,4,"Booked the site a little late so we were close to a path intersection + other campsites. The campsite itself was clean and spacious, big enough for 3 2/3 person tents, 2 cars, and communal dining tent. water was close by and clean and ..."
Killbear Provincial Park,Steve Siergjuk,5,"One of the best provincial parks around. Scenery and layout is second to none. There's a hiking/biking trail that follows the main drive in. Great way to get some exercise and see wildlife in their natural environment, all at the same ..."

Killbear Provincial Park,Dean Verner,4,"Very nice park, good trails"

Killbear Provincial Park,Paul Van Grootheest,5,"Great campground, really nice beaches, good size sites, and really easy biking path for kids but the park is very well used so animals are nearly tame and not much vegetation between sites for privacy."
Killbear Provincial Park,Ann Doroon,3,They have a curfew at 11.30pm campers are not allowed to make noise by this time. Most of our neighbors are all inside their tent sleeping. I only see one shower station in this camping area and washroom is clean but no Shower in the ...

Killbear Provincial Park,Paula P,5,Where family memories are made. Some camp areas are better than others though so I recommend a visit before booking a stay. (Sand beaches vs. shield bedrock preferences etc)
Killbear Provincial Park,Jamie O,5,Great place.  But lots of poison Ivy to watch for.  At least in some areas of the park they put up signs telling you where it is.

Killbear Provincial Park,Dan Ursin,5,My favorite place on our rv trip through Ontario. We stated on a big site near the water with easy drinking water access. More chipmunks and bluejays than I've seen in one place. One caution is the distance to electric hookups: bring an extension cord
