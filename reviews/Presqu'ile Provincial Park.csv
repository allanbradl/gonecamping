Presqu'ile Provincial Park,Thierry Josic,5,"A treasure located a mere 158KM/ 2hrs drive from downtown Toronto, where so many amazing summer days have been spent. Due to the warm fall in Southern Ontario this year, we even had a beach day in September. The waters here are very ..."

Presqu'ile Provincial Park,Bartman,4,"This park has it all... varied sites, shaded and sun, swim in a Great Lake, nice trails (hike and bike) and nearby Brighton doesn't dissapoint. If you're doing hydro, some of the
 posts are far, so a third 30amp cord is a necessity."
Presqu'ile Provincial Park,Scott Dawson,4,"Quiet, relaxing. Park has basic picnicking facilities including picnic tables, outhouses and recycle/garbage containers along the southernmost shore.(This is not ""Beach #1"" or ""Beach #2"".)The beach by the picnic area is mostly pebbles and small stones. The water is shallow, but the bottom is hard shelving shale layers."
Presqu'ile Provincial Park,Elena J,5,"A very nice, well maintained place. The beaches are good, but I like the most the picknic are with access to the water. You can find shadow or sun, water for swimming or grass for relaxing, hiking trails. And the plus is that it is not very busy!"
