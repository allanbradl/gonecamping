Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,James Park,5,I only got to spend little time here as I was traveling through. Though the time spent here was just amazing. The park has much to offer and a lot of wildlife that as a photographer I loved! Not to mention the nature and the trails. ...
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Egor Shalvarov,5,"A beautiful place to spend a weekend at. That is, of course, if you're into Nature. Well maintained trails, camp grounds and lakes.
Just a beautiful experience overall."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Ian Melamud,5,One of the best hiking spots in Ontario. Lost of trails that vary in lengths and difficulty levels with the more strenuous also being most rewarding. The views from the peaks are world-class and an occasional dip in the frigid waters of Lake Superior will refresh even the most tired hiker.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Becket Garner,5,I come here twice a year and hike and camp in the interior with my dog. We both love it. Last spring my dog and I hiked all along the Kaybeun Trail from Thunder bay lookout to and around the Giant to south end trailhead. Spent 11 days out there
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Heather Wilson,5,Spent a week at sleeping giant and had a fantastic time! We stayed on a water front site 204. It is an electrical site with water just out front and clean vault toilet very close by. A quick walk to the beach and a bike ride to the ...
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Mark Rose,5,Great hiking trails and campground.  We bought a day pass and hiked the Sea Lion trail.  Then went into the visitors center and learn all about Silver Islet and the park and checked out the beach.  Looks like good swimming at the beach ...
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Anthony Hammond,5,"We drove up this summer and spent a week in the 300's. The interior campsites are super- clean and even had a picnic table. Wherever you pitch your tent  in the 300's,  you're only feet away from the shores of Marie Louise Lake. You can ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Adam Altwasser,5,"I have far from seen the whole park, but that areas that I have seen are gorgeous.

The bays and coves are amazing, and if on the correct side it's like looking out over the ocean.

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Joseph Poniatowski,5,A must see for all traveling through our great city
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Todd Holmes,4,"The staff and location are wonderful.  Many hikes to go on and a beautiful beach. NOW MANAGMENT YOU HAVE 2 PROBLEMS. 1. How do we keep that little receipt on our dash to prove we paid, please provide tape so we can keep it on the window. ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Kirk Anderson,5,Stayed here in August and the park was packed but everyone kept respectfully quiet. Unfortunately they had barely any showers operational.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Anthony Desloges,5,Beautiful provincial park. Lots of great opportunities for hiking. Very well maintained.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Robert Porter,4,Nice private sites. Store hrs too short for the distance you must drive off park grounds to store. Would recommend this park. This is my second stay in 8 yrs.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Claudine Lacombe,5,Beautiful place. The view on the 11 km trail is awesome! (And exhausting ;) )
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Bobby Baker,5,"Sleeping Giant Provincial Park, established in 1944 as Sibley Provincial Park and renamed in 1988, is a 244-square-kilometre (94 sq mi) park located on the Sibley Peninsula in Northwestern Ontario, east of Thunder Bay. The nearest ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Michael Garlick,5,"The camping here is amazing, there's lots of sites with their own water access and the shoreline is fantastic.  My wife and I drove/camped across Canada and this was one of the highlights as far as parks went.  Beautiful scenery, hiking, and swimming. I'd recommend sleeping giant to anyone heading towards Thunder Bay."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Vivin Sam,4,"Great view and beautiful. Camping at its finest. Good for canoeing and kayaking, which can be rented at the park. Good for fishing bass, perch and okay for pike, hardly any or no Walleye. Great staff."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Sharon Silveira,5,Very beautiful. Quite busy with a lot of people backcountry camping. If you are hiking The Feet... Be warned that it is very difficult and climbers should be good physical shape. A lot of boulders and a steep almost 90 degree hike up the feet. Get there early if you want a backcountry site as they fill up fast :)
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Ronald Reynolds,4,A bit out of the way but that's why you go there. Lake Marie Louise is a beautiful fun spot for swimming or fishing. Family fun for everyone.

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Gardner Calibuso,5,This place is huge and very high cliffs!  Hikers haven!  Beautiful place

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Glen George,4,"Good facilities -helpful staff -about 40 km from the hwy to the park - good shower, washing machines and bathrooms -sites with power -took a drive past the old minor's houses -signed up for the geological discussion by an retired geologist -worth the effort"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Justin Gignac,5,I went for a hike with friends along this trail during vacation this past summer and it was amazing! I would highly recommend bringing some bug spray because there are many mosquitoes as the walk is in the middle of the woods and can ...
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Nass Nik,3,"Nice variety of trails but very confusing maps with no legends on them otherwise I would rate it 4,  mary Louise lake is nice to kayak in with a cosy beach , no wifi and very limited network access in the park"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Jennifer Wilson,5,Nice campground at Marie Louise Lake. Visitor Centre includes interactive exhibits. Many trails of varying difficulty. We enjoyed hiking the Sea Lion trail.

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Deborah Newlin,5,"The sheer size and beauty of this park is enough to draw you in, but the spectacular view of Thunder Bay and the Sleeping Giant from the Superior Lookout are just breathtaking!"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Michelle Greaves,5,"Gorgeous scenery, endless amounts of fun for the whole family"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Aileen Harju,5,It's  great to hear the loons at night and quite  peaceful.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Allan Rory,5,"What an amazing experience. The landscape leading up to the park was even stunning.
Watch for a fox & deer in the campgrounds who are -clearly- in cahoots in their scavenging... we witnessed them maneuvre unnoticed between a few campsites- definite teamwork though! They need names."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Carl Salomon,4,Great trails. Beach and camp sites . Not enough bathroom facilities!  camping  rates are high !
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Rob Mitchell OCT,5,Such a beautiful place. An absolute treasure
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,kev chouin,5,Georgous park ! Spent 2 days and would definitely go back and spend a week.

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Michael Dore,5,Been a couple of times and absolutely love this place
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Naax,5,"Great sights. Top of the head trail is pretty difficult for a nice view. Does not, however, beat the view from the top of the giant trail, in my opinion."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Shannon Barnsley,5,Absolutely gorgeous..  I was here in autumn.. would love to see it during summer!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Jared Clarke,5,Incredible place to spend time. Had a fabulous time hiking up to the knees.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Irene Lee,5,"Fantastic trail - long but not too steep except for 2 parts. We saw groups of families with young kids (6-12) running up, so it's really not that bad. Expect to take about 6-8 hours. View up top is astonishing; we flew to Thunder Bay ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Carla Sinclair,4,"Beautiful landscape, awesome swimming."

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Connie Kelsey,5,Absolutely wonderful. I'll be back again!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Julie Wong,5,"Vast park with some breath taking scenery, would have love to stay here for longer. There's camp grounds on site so saving that for next time. Bring bug spray as mosquitoe season can be quite an eye opener."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Diane Tracey,5,Love this special place!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Brad P.,5,"Amazing trails, views, and campsites. The secluded sites on the opposite side of the lake from the main campground are perfect (quiet, well separated, lake access, etc.)"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Joe Steffler,4,"Lots of trails to hike, but roads could be marked a little better"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Manu Sreeraj,5,Vast provincial park. Take your full day of to cover a small percentage of the park.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Ghazanfar Abidi,5,"Beautiful park. For the May long weekend someone of the trails weren't cleaned up of fallen trees yet, which actually added to our experience of nature. Rangers were extremely helpful. Plenty of deer around. Camping sites had very little privacy. No phone signals."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Brett MacAskill,1,"I used to love this park, both the Marie Louise Lake camp grounds, and the back country spots.  

Unfortunately, in recent years the Marie Louise Lake camp ground has essentially become a party place for the youth of Thunder Bay and ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Robin Uy,5,"A good place to hike, camp and enjoy a breath taking scenery. We went there unprepared so we just had to go to the shortest trail (30 minutes) which is the way to the sea lion, and that place is awesome. The lake was clear and cold, and the view was worth it. "
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Doug Anderson,5,"There's lots of good hiking here. The camp sites are nice. Except for the skunks recently. They were pretty friendly when we were there. Didn't spray, but who wants to take that chance?  The beach is great. Probably one of the best parts of the park. "
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,A. C.,5,"The hike was long and tiring, but absolutely worth it! We had a great time and enjoyed back country camping at Tee Harbour and all the sights! 

However, while packing up at 12:30pm park employees came right into our campsite and started ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Denis Levesque,5,Amazing park. Loved it. We are coming back on our way to Ottawa from BC and we asked for the same spot. Clean bathrooms. Even saw a large deer walk through our site at 1am!!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,steve thompson,5,Definitely worth the climb.  The view from the top is bucket list worthy.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Richard Lawson,5,"I always stop here every time I drive across Canada, it's one of my favourite parks to stay in. I always end up seeing wildlife such as skunks, grey foxes and usually deer also. Great place! "
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Charles Larocque,4,We had a fantastic 2 days at sleeping giant. Rented some mountain bikes and took to a recommended trail. Only issue is that it might need to be a bit more maintained than it is. Our campsite at Mary Louise campground site 134 had little ...
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Marcilio Rocha,5,Awesome place
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Sherry Heyder,5,Great climb. Stellar views
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,nicole dau,5,Beautiful park! We wish we had gotten to the park sooner to allow for more time to hike. Next time we will bring bikes for part of the trail and then hike the rest. We didn't make it to the top as ran out of time which was a bummer. Make sure to pack some food and drinks with if you plan to hike the distance! 
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Justin Bell,5,"Great campground, spent a night and wish we could have spent more. Great hiking, awesome view of the sleeping giant from the beach, stayed at site 114 and had stairs right down from behind our spot, great location."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Matti 53,5,Great place to spend a day
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Doug Robinson,5,"Lots of hiking trails for any ability level. Beautiful scenery, clear dark skies at night for astronomy. Plenty of wildlife, nice campsites.  Just bring plenty with you, it's a long drive out to get food or gas."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Cory Misener,5,This prov park is by far one of the top ones in the prov. Beautiful scenery.  Fantastic trails to hike for all some very nice lakes to fish and swim in.  We habe been twice in the last couple of yrs amd will most likely be back.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,James MacDonald,4,"A little out of the way, but a great place to camp and hike. Just be ready for noisy morons on the campgrounds."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Alex Kissel,5,Had a lovely time. Staff were very nice. Views from the Giant are amazing
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,jenny keller,5,"The bathrooms were spotless, the staff were very friendly, and there was very minimal garbage on the ground. There were lots of camping sites, some were quite close together but others had more privacy. The only ""bad"" thing I have to say is it was quite a long drive into the camping area from the highway."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Trevor Owchar,4,What beautiful campground! Except for the night the campground ran out of wood and wasn't delivered until 11pm. Actually I had to chase the park warden down.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,AL KRC,4,Great hiking trails.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Kennia Buckley,5,Staff were friendly and helpful.  Showers and bathrooms we clean.   Park was well maintained.   Lots of wildlife.   Will definately make the trek back up
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Sean Murphy,5,Natural wonder here in Northwest Ontario.  Many Native tales surrounding this beautiful piece of glacial carved stone.  Surrounded by Lake Superior the Sleeping Giant rests and only changes with the colours of the seasons.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Stephen S.M.,5,Cool trails and awesome sights
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Tim Cruickshank,4,"Beautiful park. Note that the campground is about 30 minutes off of the main highway. We stayed in the campsites on the west side of the lake. They're more private and scenic, but require a 10 minute drive on dirt roads in and out. The hiking is incredible. "
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Maksym Tazetdinov,5,Great place!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Jenny Rose,5,beautiful hiking spots!!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Andrew Denner,5,An amazing park! Signage leaves a little bit to be desired as we had a bit of trouble finding the visitor center as it is hidden in the back of the campground. We hiked the short trail to the sea lion. It is a great place to get away ...
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Tareq Anwar,4,Didn't meet my expectations. Maybe I had high expectations. But good for hiking. If you can visit Kekabeka Falls if you can. 
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,J. Ziemianin,4,Great views. Super buggy. The animals while cute were way too friendly.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Annabelle Lee,5,"Fantastic hiking! Found a trail down to the shoreline and jumped into the water. The hike was pretty tough at places, be sure to have real hiking boots and pants. Lots of climbing over fallen trees! "
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Randy de Resendes,5,"Amazing place. We were greeted to our camp site by a family of ducks and a deer that walked on through. There are a lot of trails in the area. Recommend the Sea Lion and if you are up for it the top of the Giant, although be prepared, and set the day aside for it, well worth it.  Look forward to going again"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Carrie Stewart,4,Stay was good  everything very clean  and staff are helpful only thing they should have more programs and activities for kids through out the summer!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,JD Tong,5,Absolutely great
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Bryan Bishop,4,"A nice park, tho over priced for amount of traffic they get. Groomed trails are easy to hike, Signs every where. you will see wild life like deer, birds and maybe the odd bear."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Hayden Rutan,5,Highly recommend the day hike to the top of the giant. Make sure you keep going past the peak for some amazing views.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Darcy Brambrink,5,"Beautiful park! Clean, sites are large and private. Lots of hiking trails and biking trails.  Staff was helpful.  Stayed 2 days on our way around Lake Superior worth it! Drive into park is 20 miles but scenic, stayed on Marie Louise Lake ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Thomas Grainge,5,"Absolutely gorgeous park. Hiked to the top of the Sleeping Giant, which was about 11 km from the parking lot and almost 1000 feet vertical climb. Absolutely breathtaking views. Mary Louise lake campground had lots of sites but they were ..."

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Colin Tait,5,Beautiful campground. Lake side camp sites are great! 
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Blair Coveney,4,"Beautiful camping, campground at Mary Louise can be a tad crowded even mid week.  The animals here have OBVIOUSLY been benefiting from humans feeding them and are not scared of humans in the least.  Ducks roaming my campsite for crumbs ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,ady barel,5,Love love love that park! Would recommend but! Bring anti mosquitos!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,dee roswell,4,"Loved seeing all the wildlife, good clean park. The only thing I would have asked for is better trail markings and distance. Overall best ontario park I have been too ‚ù§"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Jesse Tucker,5,My wife and I are avid hikers and really enjoyed the challenging hikes at Sleeping Giant. There are so many trails and hiking possibilities that the park could keep you busy for days. The views are varied and breathtaking while the hikes ...

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Sharen,5,Great way to spend the day. Great hikes and beautiful scenery. 
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Michael Kluzak,5,"Loved it!  Beautiful park.  Look out for the bears though.  We had one in our campsite.  We ate breakfast, and were just going to change in the tent before going to throw away our (maybe a 5-10 minute delay?) And a bear showed up in our site to go after the trash.  Changed our mind about grilling lunch after that. :-)"

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Chuck Wagner,5,"Excellent park, especially early or late in the season when you have the place to yourself. Hiking and biking, and Marie Louise lake is excellent for kayaking around. Many campsites are right on the water. (I have to believe that the people giving the park a 1 star rating are trying to keep it a secret.)"
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Josh Crow,4,Campground was good. Some sites are close together. The actual sleeping giant provides a cool view.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Autumn Stevens,5,Anything in nature is beautiful!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Julia Chernushevich,5,Great place to go camping and hiking. Saw a lot of deer on the drive in.  Warning though: the 300s campsites take a bit of an extra off-road drive to get to!
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Jeffrey Chan,5,"Been here twice. The first time I underestimated the time it took to get up to the top of the giant so I had to rush back to the parking lot to avoid hiking in pitch dark, but gotta say the view up the top is well worth the trek if you ..."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,VISHNU SAKTHIVEL,5,Great hiking experience and outing for groups.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Robert Cochrane,5,"One of the best parks in Ontario, great trails with a large variety of difficulty levels for different levels/ages.  Wonderful views off trails and even a great drive to lookout at the ""Thunder Bay Lookout"".  Have been frequenting for years and bringing the kids as their hiking abilities change as they get older."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Trevor Stewart,5,Best campsite I've been to in Ontario
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Stacia Staska,5,"So pretty!! Would not recommend in winter, it was so slippery and icy everywhere "

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Scott Howells,5,BEAUTIFUL. Amazing hiking trails and vistas all across the park.
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Kyle Petten,2,Had to pay $15 to get in for the day pass. That was a little disappointing as there was not much amenities for that cost. We went to the beach which was very rocky and messy. The beach could be grated or something so the sand is all that remains. 
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Philip Bulsink,5,"Hiked Top of the Giant trail. Wonderful day hike, 22 km, 550m total elevation. Take water."
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Matthew Sears,5,"Excellent example of old growth boreal forest in an easily accessible campground.  Great for families and dayhikes, as well as interior camping."

Sleeping Giant Provincial Park,Dragosh Catana,3,"We planned on doing an easy hike along ""sawyer trail"" since we had a late start to our day (we drove from TBay at approx. 1pm). Once off the highway onto the 587 it's a pleasant winding road into the park. It's poorly indicated, but you ..."
