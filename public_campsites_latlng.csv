<h2>Biking</h2>
<p><strong>Minnesing Mountain Bike Trail </strong><br/>
The Minnesing Mountain Bike Trail is located 23 km from the West Gate and 33 km from the East Gate, just off of Hwy 60. The trail consists of four loops, with distances of 4.7, 10.1, 17.1 and 23.4 kilometres. All four loops are hilly and unsuitable for small children and unfit adults. They are rated at a moderate level of technical difficulty. The western or return side of each loop follows the old Minnesing Road where the trail is smoother and the grades are less steep. Expect extensive muddy sections until the drier weather of August and September. Cabins are located at the start of the trail and on the return run of the second loop. The trail passes through hardwood forest with views of three lakes along the way.</p>
<p>  <strong>Old Railway Bike Trail</strong><br/>
The Old Railway Bike Trail runs from Mew Lake Campground to Rock Lake Campground but can also be accessed from Pog Lake Campground. This 10 kilometre leisurely trail runs along the abandoned rail bed of the historic Ottawa, Arnprior, and Parry Sound Railway built across the park in 1895. The trail has several interpretive panels along the route which explain Algonquin’s history. </p>
<p><strong>Byers Lake Mountain Bike Trail</strong><br/>
A short mountain bike trail of 6.5 km (13 km round trip) and moderate degree of difficulty can also be accessed east of the Kingscote Access Point. Once on the mountain bike trail, there is an interesting 150 m side trail that provides access to Gut Rapids, which is a narrow scenic canyon on the York River.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>More than 260 bird species have been recorded in the park. Many southern and overseas birders make special trips to Algonquin just to see northern specialties such as the Gray Jay and the Spruce Grouse, not to mention the rich variety of warblers or Algonquin’s most famous bird of all—the Common Loon, found nesting on just about every lake.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Motorboats are not permitted on most lakes within the park, however there are some exceptions.  </p>
<p>(a) Motors of unlimited horsepower may be used on Galeairy and Opeongo Lakes.</p>
<p>(b) Motors of 20 horsepower or less may be used on the following lakes: Bonita, Cache, Canoe, Cedar, Kingscote, Kioshkokwi, Little Cauchon, Rock, Smoke, Source, Tanamakoon, Tea, Two Rivers, and Whitefish.</p>
<p>(c) Motors of 10 horsepower or less may be used on the following lakes: Cauchon, Cauliflower, Grand, Joe, Little Joe, Madawaska, Manitou, North Tea, Radiant, Rain, Tepee, and Travers.</p>
<p>(d) Motors of 6 horsepower or less may be used, from the day following Labour Day to the last Thursday in June, on the following lakes: Big Crow, Hogan, La Muir, Little Crow, Proulx and White Partridge or the Crow River from Proulx Lake to Little Crow Lake.</p>
<p>Waterskiing, jetskiing and other similar activities are not permitted within Algonquin Provincial Park.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Algonquin Provincial Park offers the canoeing enthusiast a network of over 2,100 km of canoe routes. A detailed map-brochure, Canoe Routes of Algonquin Park shows the entire park network of canoe routes, portages, and interior campsites. Elsewhere on the maps, detailed directions are given for 29 different access points along with complete information on planning and completing a canoe trip. A copy of this map can be purchased for $4.95 from the <a href=""http://algonquinpark.on.ca"">Friends of Algonquin Park</a>.</p>
<p>Reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment, but are not necessary for backcountry campsites. Reservations can be made by calling the Ontario Parks Reservation Service. Permits must be picked up at a designated access point on the day of departure. Please consider your trip details carefully and always plan for the unexpected. Information relating to trip planning can be obtained by calling the Algonquin Provincial Park Information Line at 705-633-5572. Users will reserve a campsite on a specific lake each night; however individual campsites on that lake are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Algonquin has a reputation for some of the best trout fishing in Canada. More than 230 lakes have native Brook Trout and 149 have Lake Trout—a fantastic concentration of trout waters that continue to yield good fishing because of the park’s tradition of wise conservation. </p>
<p>Along the highway, many of the lakes are stocked with Splake (a hybrid of Brook and Lake Trout) and fishing is outstanding. Spring is the best season for trout and summer brings on more enjoyment with Smallmouth Bass. Spend a July day with the family at a prime bass location, enjoying the scenery and reeling in the night’s dinner.</p>

<p>The interior of Algonquin offers over 140 km of backpacking trails with designated campsites. Campsites are designated for hikers only and are always located close to the water’s edge. The trails are regularly maintained, but some sections can be very challenging and rugged. The scenery, forest types and terrain vary throughout the trail network offering great wildlife viewing opportunities. Interior camping fees, rules and regulations apply.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern Pines Backpacking Trail</strong><br/>
The Eastern Pines Trail is an overnight backpacking trail with loops of 6 to 15 kilometres in length. The trail can be accessed from the Achray Access Point. Permits can be picked up at the Sand Lake Gate. </p>
<p><strong>Western Uplands Backpacking Trail</strong><br/>
The Western Uplands is an overnight backpacking trail with loops of 32 - 88 kilometres in length. The trail can be accessed from the Western Uplands Backpacking Trailhead/Oxtongue River Picnic Ground or the Rain Lake Access Point. </p>
<p><strong>Highland Backpacking Trail</strong><br/>
Highland Backpacking Trail is an overnight backpacking trail with loops of 19 and 35 km in length. The challenging trail can be accessed from the Highland Backpacking Trailhead near the Mew Lake Campground.</p> <h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Hunting in this park is subject to the Ontario Hunting Regulations. Certain restrictions apply. For more information, contact the park or a Ministry of Natural Resources office.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>The clear, clean lakes of Algonquin offer endless opportunities for swimming. Discover secluded beaches or rocks for jumping as you paddle through the interior of the park.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>The mood of Algonquin in winter is very different from the summer scene familiar to most park visitors. On clear, frosty days after a fresh snowfall, there are breathtaking views of frozen lakes ringed by snow-covered conifers. At night the sky is bright with a billion stars and trees crack like rifle shots in the frozen stillness of the surrounding wilderness. In the winter the easiest part of Algonquin to visit are areas accessible from the Highway 60 corridor in the southwest section of the park. A valid permit is required to use the park. Permits can be purchased at the East or West Gates or at the self-service station at the </p>
<p><strong>Mew Lake Campground.</strong><br/>
 Snowshoeing enthusiasts can go virtually anywhere within the park except on cross-country ski trails. If you prefer a set trail, you might try one of the short walking trails along the Highway 60 corridor or one of the two longer backpacking trails.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Nordic Skiing is very popular in Algonquin. </strong><br/>
Leaf Lake Trail system provides some of the most beautiful vistas and exhilarating skiing available anywhere. These trails are found one km west of the East Gate. As you explore the landscape you may see the tracks of moose, otter, ruffed grouse, marten and many other animals.   Leaf Lake Ski Trail offers a wide variety of trail selections ranging in length from 5 to 51 km and ranging from easy to very difficult. The system includes three loops that are groomed for skate skiing. All trails are groomed and many are track set. Cabins and toilets are available at several locations throughout the trail system. These cabins are regularly maintained and stocked with firewood. Privies are located nearby.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Fen Lake Ski Trail</strong> is located at the West Gate of the park. Much of this trail travels through the hardwood bush typical of Algonquin’s west side. You will almost certainly see the tracks of moose on your outing. It offers four loops of 1.25, 5.2, 11.4 and 13 km and offers both easy and more challenging sections. All trails are groomed and track set and a 6 km section also offers a lane for skate skiing. A cabin is located at Fen Lake and privies are available throughout the trail network.  </p>
<p><strong>Minnesing Trail</strong> is located on the north side of Highway 60, 23 km from the West Gate. The Minnesing Trail has four loops ranging in distance from 4.7 to 23.4 km. The trail is maintained for backcountry wilderness skiing and is not groomed. Wide touring skis and large basket poles are essential for soft snow conditions. This trail network is very challenging and is only recommended for experienced skiers who are well prepared for the conditions.  To minimize damage to trails, dogs, walking, snowshoeing, toboggans and sleighs are not permitted on ski trails.</p>
<p>An extensive <strong>dog sledding</strong> network exists in Algonquin. Several commercial operators offer this service and should be contacted directly for prices and information. Overnight trips of up to seven days are available. The scenery and experience that this adventure offers will create memories to last a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong> Interior Camping  </strong></p>
<p>Camping away from Highway 60 in the interior of the park is also permitted during winter. You may wish to use one of the groomed ski trails to enter the park interior but camping within sight or sound of the trails or in trail shelters is not permitted. Winter camping is also not permitted on designated summer campsites or within 30 metres of a lakeshore, trail or portage. We recommend that you camp in low sheltered areas where there is a good supply of standing dead firewood for warmth and cooking. Reservations are not required; however valid interior permits are. Permits can be purchased at the East or West Gates.</p>
<p><strong>  Ice Conditions </strong></p>
<p>We advise against ice travel. Ice conditions may vary due to weather, snow depth, pressure cracks, and many other variables. Hazards are difficult to detect. Ice may be safe in one location and unsafe nearby. Use alternate land routes to avoid ice travel.<br/>
<br/>
No lodges or rental outfitters operate in Algonquin during the winter, but yurts are available for rent at Mew Lake Campground.</p>
<p>Winter fishing is not permitted in Algonquin Provincial Park and snowmobiling is only permitted on the hydro line across Clyde Township.</p> </div>","<div id=""facilities"">

<p>The Canisbay Campground is the perfect starting point for exploring the Minnesing Mountain Bike Trail; located 23 km from the West Gate and 33 km from the East Gate, just off of Hwy 60. The trail consists of four loops, with distances of 4.7, 10.1, 17.1 and 23.4 kilometres. All four loops are hilly and unsuitable for small children and unfit adults and are rated at a moderate level of technical difficulty. The western or return side of each loop follows the old Minnesing Road where the trail is smoother and the grades are less steep. Expect extensive muddy sections until the drier weather of August and September. Cabins are located at the start of the trail and on the return run of the second loop. The trail passes through hardwood forest with views of three lakes along the way. </p>
<p>In addition, the Old Railway Bike Trail between Rock Lake and Mew Lake Campgrounds was extended in 2011 and is just a short drive away. The extension adds 6.2 km of bike trail that runs west from Mew Lake Campground to the Track and Tower Trail. You can now plan a combined adventure by cycling to the most westerly end of the bike trail and then hiking up the “Tower” portion of the Track and Tower Trail to take in a premier vista of Algonquin Provincial Park.  The full bike trail is now 16.2 km in length and is accessible from Rock &amp; Coon Lake, Pog Lake and Mew Lake Campgrounds.  This leisurely trail runs along the abandoned rail bed of the historic Ottawa, Arnprior, and Parry Sound Railway built across the park in 1895.

<p><strong>Art Centre</strong><br/>
At km 20, on a small hill next to Found Lake, there sits a giant, hollow sculpture made of stone. Created in 1953, this work of art was the original Park Museum. In 2005, new life was breathed into its earthly presence – as the Algonquin Art Centre!</p>
<p>The Framing Place and Gallery (Huntsville) has been entrusted to carry out this unique project. The central vision of this project is to act as a bridge, connecting the art world with the natural world, as well as to promote the preservation and protection of the environment, from a local to global scale.<br/>
Another Art Centre ethic is to make this facility available to everyone. It is wheelchair accessible and the entrance fee is a voluntary admission, where your contribution will be put towards the enhancement of this “open-concept” project.</p>
<p>The Algonquin Art Centre has an indoor gallery, consisting of three wings and a boutique; an outdoor gallery; and a “Green” Gazebo where you can treat yourself to various tasty treats, teas and coffees, or participate in one of the many scheduled art activities for both adults and children.</p>

<p><strong>Minnesing Trail</strong> is located on the north side of Highway 60, 23 km from the West Gate. The Minnesing Trail has four loops ranging in distance from 4.7 to 23.4 km. The trail is maintained for backcountry wilderness skiing and is not groomed. Wide touring skis and large basket poles are essential for soft snow conditions. </p>
<p><strong>Leaf Lake Trail</strong> system provides some of the most beautiful vistas and exhilarating skiing available anywhere. These trails are found one km west of the East Gate. As you explore the landscape you may see the tracks of moose, otter, ruffed grouse, marten and many other animals.   Leaf Lake Ski Trail offers a wide variety of trail selections ranging in length from 5 to 51 km and ranging from easy to very difficult.

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>The Old Railway Bike Trail between Rock Lake and Mew Lake Campgrounds was extended in 2011. The extension adds 6.2 km of bike trail that runs west from Mew Lake Campground to the Track and Tower Trail. You can now plan a combined adventure by biking to the most westerly end of the bike trail and then hiking up the “Tower” portion of the Track and Tower Trail to take in a premier vista of Algonquin Provincial Park.  The full bike trail is now 16.2 km in length and is accessible from Rock &amp; Coon Lake, Pog Lake, Mew Lake Campgrounds.  This leisurely trail runs along the abandoned rail bed of the historic Ottawa, Arnprior, and Parry Sound Railway built across the park in 1895. The trail has several interpretive panels along the route which explain Algonquin’s history.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>More than 260 bird species have been recorded in the Park. Many southern and overseas birders make special trips to Algonquin just to see northern specialties such as the Gray Jay and the Spruce Grouse, not to mention the rich variety of warblers or Algonquin’s most famous bird of all—the Common Loon, found nesting on just about every lake.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Canoeists can paddle from Pog Lake down through Whitefish, to Rock Lake or up to the Lake of Two Rivers to explore even more of the park by canoe.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Algonquin has a reputation for some of the best trout fishing in Canada. More than 230 lakes have native Brook Trout and 149 have Lake Trout—a fantastic concentration of trout waters that continue to yield good fishing because of the Park’s tradition of wise conservation. </p>
<p>Along the highway, many of the lakes are stocked with Splake (a hybrid of Brook and Lake trout) and fishing is outstanding. Spring is the best season for trout and summer brings on more enjoyment with Smallmouth Bass. Spend a July day with the family at a prime bass location, enjoying the scenery and reeling in the night’s dinner.</p>

Many southern and overseas birders make special trips to Algonquin just to see northern specialties such as the Gray Jay and the Spruce Grouse, not to mention the rich variety of warblers or Algonquin’s most famous bird of all—the Common Loon, found nesting on just about every lake.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Power boats with a maximum of 20 horsepower are permitted on Whitefish Lake.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Algonquin has a reputation for some of the best trout fishing in Canada. More than 230 lakes have native Brook Trout and 149 have Lake Trout—a fantastic concentration of trout waters that continue to yield good fishing because of the Park’s tradition of wise conservation.<br/>
<br/>
Along the highway, many of the lakes are stocked with Splake (a hybrid of Brook and Lake trout) and fishing is outstanding. Spring is the best season for trout and summer brings on more enjoyment with Smallmouth Bass. Spend a July day with the family at a prime bass location, enjoying the scenery and reeling in the night’s dinner. Whitefish offers excellent Bass Fishing. </p>

<p>Algonquin offers many opportunities for hiking. The following trails are located near the Whitefish Lake Campground.</p>
<p><strong>Lookout Trail located at km 39.7 - 1.9 km (1 hour) moderate</strong><br/>
This trail is relatively steep and rugged but affords the hiker with a magnificent view of several hundred square kilometres of Algonquin.</p>
<p><strong>Booth’s Rock Trail located at km 40.5 - 5.1 km (2 hours) moderate</strong><br/>
This trail visits two lakes and a spectacular lookout, returning via an abandoned railway. <br/>
 <br/>
<strong>Spruce Bog Boardwalk located at km 42.5 - 1.5 km (1hour) easy</strong><br/>
Several boardwalk sections in the looped trail give you an excellent close-up look of two typical northern Black Spruce bogs. The trail is located right off of the Highway 60 corridor, making it very accessible for bird watching. </p>
<p><strong> Beaver Pond Trail located at km 45.2 - 2 km (1 hour) moderate</strong><br/>
This trail provides excellent views of two beaver ponds.</p> <h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Hunting in this park is subject to the Ontario Hunting Regulations. Certain restrictions apply. For more information, contact the park or a Ministry of Natural Resources office.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p><strong>Conducted walks</strong> are led by park naturalists every day from late June to Labour Day. These consist of an hour and a half leisurely walk, exploring and learning about some part of the park environment. Times and locations are posted at bulletin boards within the parks.</p>
<p><strong>  Algonquin for Kids :</strong> Come with your kids (ages 5 to 12) to the Visitor Centre for an hour of discovery with games, stories and animals. Times and topics are posted at bulletin boards within the parks.  </p>
<p><strong>Evening Programs</strong> begin at dusk every evening at the Outdoor Theatre (at km 35.4) from late June to Labour Day. Each program lasts about an hour and a half and consists of a film, a slide talk about some aspect of the park, a question period and them another film. When bad weather interferes, the programs are held at the Visitor Centre. Times and topics are posted at bulletin boards within the parks.  </p>
<p><strong>Special Events</strong> are listed in This Week in Algonquin Park posted at all bulletin boards in the park. Public Wolf Howls take place on Thursdays in August if a pack has been located in a suitable location and if the weather is favourable. Check the bulletin boards, call the Visitor Centre (613-637-2828) or check The Friends of Algonquin Park website on the Thursday morning to find out if a Wolf Howl is going to be held that day.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>A beach is available on Whitefish Lake for campground visitors.</p> </div>","<div id=""facilities"">
<h2>Visitor Centre</h2>
<p><strong>Visitor Centre</strong><br/>
The Visitor Centre is open year-round and features exhibits on the natural and human history of Algonquin, a theatre which plays the video presentation “Images of Algonquin”, a viewing deck that looks out over an amazing Algonquin landscape, bookstore, and “The Algonquin Room” which exhibits Algonquin themed art by local artists. </p>
<p><strong>Logging Museum</strong><br/>
The Algonquin Logging Museum brings to life the story of logging from the early square timber days to the last of the great river drives. Start your visit with a video presentation that sums up the logging history of the Algonquin area. On the easy-to-walk 1.5 km trail, a recreated camboose camp and a fascinating steam-powered amphibious tug called an “alligator” are among the many displays. Take a step back in time and learn about this very colourful aspect of Algonquin’s cultural history. As well, the Algonquin Logging Museum has an excellent bookstore staffed by The Friends of Algonquin Park</p>
<p><strong>Art Centre</strong><br/>
At km 20, on a small hill next to Found Lake, there sits a giant, hollow sculpture made of stone. Created in 1953, this work of art was the original Park Museum. In 2005, new life was breathed into its earthly presence – as the Algonquin Art Centre!</p>
<p>The Framing Place and Gallery (Huntsville) has been entrusted to carry out this unique project. The central vision of this project is to act as a bridge, connecting the art world with the natural world, as well as to promote the preservation and protection of the environment, from a local to global scale.</p>
<p>Another Art Centre ethic is to make this facility available to everyone – it is wheelchair accessible and the entrance fee is a voluntary admission, where your contribution will be put towards the enhancement of this “open-concept” project.</p>
<p>The Algonquin Art Centre has an indoor gallery, consisting of three wings and a boutique; an outdoor gallery; and a “Green” Gazebo where you can treat yourself to various tasty treats, teas and coffees, or participate in one of the many scheduled art activities for both adults and children.</p>

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>Arrowhead has two moderately challenging mountain bike trails – the 4.5 km Arrowhead Lake Trail and the 3 km Lookout Trail.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Several species of birds make Arrowhead their home in the spring and summer months, before migrating south for the winter. A bird list is available at the main gate.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Motorized boats (including electric motors) are prohibited on Arrowhead and Mayflower lakes. Canoes are ideal for exploring the shorelines and viewing the wildlife of these lakes.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Be aware of weather conditions before going out as well as making sure you wear a personal floatation device (PFD) at all times.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Mayflower Lake is stocked with Rainbow Trout. Arrowhead Lake is good for Small Mouth Bass. A valid fishing license and outdoors card is required.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p><strong>Beaver Meadow Trail - 7 km (2 hours) moderate</strong> <br/>
Arrowhead’s longest trail passes Porcupine Bluffs, the remnant shoreline of a huge ancient lake. The bluffs are easily visible in the spring and fall but are hidden during the leafy summer months. The trail circles a large beaver pond with large rafts of cattails where you might see otter, moose, Great Blue Heron, Tree Swallows and, of course, beavers. Near the end, the trail crosses a field and you can see evidence of the once successful Oke homestead—old fence lines, building foundations and domestic plants such as rhubarb and apple trees.</p>
<p><strong>Big Bend Lookout – easy</strong> <br/>
This short walk from the parking lot on Roe Campground Road leads to a panoramic view of the meandering Big East River and the surrounding Muskoka terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Homesteaders Trail - 3 km (1 hour) moderate</strong><br/>
In the 1870s, homesteaders cleared this area. Take this trail across moderately rugged terrain and see traces of abandoned farm fields now reclaimed by young forest.</p>
<p><strong>Mayflower Lake Trail – 1 km (30 minutes) moderate </strong><br/>
Ten thousand years ago, Mayflower Lake was a small bay in a large glacial lake. Today it is a small, deep, spring-fed lake. Its cold, clear waters provide ideal habitat for cold water fish such as Rainbow Trout. This trail has several lengthy climbs and descents over the hills surrounding Mayflower Lake and can be muddy, so wear your hiking boots.</p>
<p><strong>Stubb’s Falls Trail - 2 km (45 minutes) easy</strong> <br/>
Take this trail in early spring when wildflowers and songbirds will be your reward. At Stubb’s Falls, the Little East River rushes down a rock chute. Stop here for a pleasant respite.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p>Park staff offer weekly educational programs for children and adults from early July to Labour Day. They include nature and historical walks, evening programs with guest speakers and videos, and children’s crafts and games.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>There are three quiet, clean, sandy beaches with change facilities that back into birch groves. Please note: there are no lifeguards posted at the beaches and pets are not permitted.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>The main park road and three parking lots are kept open for winter visitors and to host major events including the Annual Muskoka Loppet (<a href=""http://arrowheadnordic.ca"">http://arrowheadnordic.ca</a>), elementary school races and much more. In the winter, Arrowhead grooms and maintains more than 33 km of cross-country ski trails that are designed for classic skiing or skate skiing. Check the current <a href=""/skireport/detail/arrowhead"">trail conditions in the ski report</a>. Each trail is rated for difficulty and ranges from beginner to expert. The park offers a variety of hiking/snowshoeing trails as well as a skating trail. There are two warm-up shelters and an open fire pit at the top of the tubing hill! (Tubes provided).</p> </div>","<div id=""facilities"">

<p>The pet exercise area is located at the north end of Arrowhead Lake; it is the only designated area in the park where dogs can be walked without a leash. There is also a small area near the main beach (both sides of the bridge) where dogs can swim.</p> <h2>Picnic Shelters</h2>
<p>A group picnic shelter in the day-use area accommodates 50 – 100 people and can be reserved for birthday parties, reunions, gatherings or any other special event. Reservations can be made by calling the Park Office Monday – Friday, starting in April.</p> <h2>Rentals</h2>

<br/>
The closest boat launch facilities are in Penetanguishene. Outboard motors are not allowed on Kettle’s Lake.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Awenda’s quiet and scenic Kettle’s Lake is an excellent location for putting in your own canoe or one you rent from the park. This small, motorboat free lake is ideally suited for the novice paddler or nature enthusiast.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Bass, Northern Pike, pickerel and smaller panfish are commonly found in the waters between Awenda and Giant’s Tomb Island. Bass and panfish are also found in Kettle’s Lake.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>Awenda offers a nice variety of looped and linear, easy to moderate trails and range from 1 to 13 km in length. One trail provides barrier-free access.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Beach Trail – 4 km return (1.5 hours) linear, easy</strong><br/>
 This trail takes hikers along the Georgian Bay shoreline. Giant’s Tomb Island is visible from the trail. The contrast between the dry oak-maple forest of the campgrounds and the low, wet birch-cedar-hemlock forest below the bluff can be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Beaver Pond Trail – 1 km (30 minutes) loop, easy, barrier free </strong><br/>
Located in a nature reserve zone most of this trail is a boardwalk that takes you through an area altered by past and present beaver activity. Along the way you will see the remains of both a building and a bridge from the early logging days. The area also offers views of the dominant Nipissing bluff as well as excellent opportunities for viewing wildlife, wildflowers and many species of birds.</p>
<p><strong>Bluff Trail – 13 km (3.5 hours) loop, moderate</strong><br/>
 This circular trail can be accessed from a number of locations within the park. It travels partly along a high bluff and partly through a low wetland. Views of Georgian Bay from sections of this trail are spectacular, especially during the late autumn, early spring leaf- free season.</p>
<p><strong>Nipissing Trail – 1 km return (30 minutes) linear, moderate </strong><br/>
The Nipissing Bluff is the dominant glacial feature in Awenda. It is a raised beach created 5,500 years ago by glacial Lake Nipissing. Today a 155 step staircase allows hikers to easily descend 32 metres down the face of the bluff, at times providing you with the sensation of being part of the forest canopy.</p>
<p><strong>Brûlé Trail - 4 km return (1.5 hours) linear, easy</strong><br/>
 This trail passes through a portion of the park’s upland mixed deciduous forest. Lumbering and fires have obliterated the White Pine stands so that the majority of trees are now Sugar Maple and Red Oak. Lumbering on the peninsula was at its peak in the late 1800s. Since then the forest has been allowed to revert to its natural state but the White Pine has been unable to fully re-establish itself.</p>
<p><strong>Robitaille Homestead Trail – 3 km return (1hour) linear, easy</strong><br/>
 Hikers follow this trail to an ancient dune system. The age of these sand dunes has been estimated at 11,500 years, from the time of the last glacial retreat. The dunes are a very fragile environment and we ask that you do not climb the hillside, stand on the edge of the bluff or climb down the bluff. This will allow plants to re-establish themselves and will help us preserve this area for future park visitors. On the way to the dunes, this trail passes an abandoned farmstead originally built in 1902. Remains of the stone foundations and fence rows can still be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Wendat Trail – 5 km (2 hours) loop, easy</strong><br/>
This trail begins at Kettle’s Lake. This lake is thought to be a kettle lake formed by the gradual melting of a large buried piece of ice left by retreating glaciers. Today, this area is a favoured nesting spot for the Red-winged Blackbird and the Great Blue Heron is often seen in the swamps around the lake. The trail passes the foundations of the Brabant farmstead house and barn. Attempts to farm this area in the 1930s and 40s failed due to the poor, sandy soil.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p>Awenda offers a wide variety of programs for enthusiasts of all ages. Regularly scheduled guided hikes, children’s programs, special events and evening programs occur from late June to early fall featuring the unique cultural history and the biology of the park.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>Awenda features several beautiful and natural beaches on the Georgian Bay shoreline within driving distance from the campgrounds. The most protected and sandiest beach area is at Methodist Point Bay (Third Beach). Swimmers are reminded that that there are no lifeguards at the beaches. </p>
<p>For a refundable deposit, you can borrow a properly fitted personal floatation device (PFD) during your stay at Awenda.<br/>
<br/>
Awenda has designated a stretch of its scenic Georgian Bay shoreline as a Pet Beach. This is the only public beach in the park where pets are permitted. However they still must be kept on a two metre leash and it is the owner’s responsibility to clean up after them.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>The park is not open for camping, but the trails and forests are available as a backcountry style experience for the more adventuresome ski and snowshoe enthusiast. <br/>
<br/>
Trails begin at the Trail Centre, a cozy wood heated log cabin. Although 17 kilometres of ski trail are often packed and set with a single track, be prepared to occasionally track your own trails due to the backcountry intent of this self-use winter program.<br/>
<br/>
Snowshoeing is popular through the park’s many hectares of open bush; however there are no designated snowshoe trails.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs are not permitted on winter trails and visitors must provide their own equipment as rentals are not available. <br/>

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>Bicycles are a great way to explore the campground. They are permitted on park roads but not on the trail system.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>The boreal forest is home to a variety of bird species. Often the Common Loon fills the evening sky with its mournful song as Chimney Swifts fly high above, snagging insects out of the air. Bald Eagles are common place as well as many forest dwelling song birds. Bird checklists are available at the Visitor Centre.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Power boats are allowed on all lakes within Blue Lake Provincial Park but please be aware of non-motorized canoes, kayaks and sailboats.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>

<p>Detailed maps and more canoe route information is available at the Blue Lake Park Office.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Blue Lake is a popular fishing lake for Lake Trout, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Walleye and the elusive musky can be caught but are a challenge even for an experienced angler. Nearby Corner Lake and the Indian Lake chain are popular for walleye.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>

<p><strong>Goblin Lake Trail – 11 km, moderate, full day</strong><br/>
For those with an adventurous streak, the Goblin Lake Trail follows the edge of Goblin Lake and explores the wilds of Northern Ontario the way our pioneers would have.

<p><strong>Rock Point Trail – 4km, moderate</strong><br/>
This 4 km trail takes you through a variety of environments from cedar groves to Jack Pine ridges. As you will be hiking through varying terrain, be sure to wear appropriate foot wear. Your journey starts at the beaver pond and loops back to the campground near M road.</p>
<p><strong>Spruce Fen Boardwalk Trail - 1 km, easy, barrier-free, 30 minutes</strong><br/>
A fen is a fascinating world where land floats on water, plants eat animals and creatures of the water fly. The Spruce Fen Trail takes you through a Black Spruce fen and a beaver pond environment. Interpretive signs help describe these environments along the trail. To protect the fen, the trail is a boardwalk and is also wheelchair accessible.</p> <h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Hunting is permitted in the Blue Lake park additions. Be sure to ask a Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry representative of proper boundaries.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p>During the summer staff offer a variety of fun, interactive educational programs. Join a Park Naturalist as you explore the hiking trails, stop by the Visitor Centre to learn about the 1900s burn that made Blue Lake what it is today, bring your young campers to the children’s programs and take the whole family to the evening campfires and slide shows!</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>Blue Lake is renowned for its long sandy beaches and exceptionally clear, blue water. Summer fun in the water is what brings families to Blue Lake. A buoy line marks the swimming area.</p>
<p>Please note that the beach is not supervised by lifeguards. Pets and alcohol are prohibited on the beach.</p> </div>","<div id=""facilities"">

These include many types of colourful warblers, flycatchers, thrushes, hawks and owls. Several species of birds can be seen year round including: Black-capped Chickadees, Red-breasted Nuthatches, various woodpeckers, and the friendly Gray Jay.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>

<p><strong>Drumlin Trail System - 3 interconnecting looped trails:  Blue 1.2 km (1.0 hour); White 2.5 km (2 hours) and Red 2.5 km (2.5 hours), moderate</strong> <br/>
The Drumlin Trail System takes you through mature mixed forest, by small wetlands and along seasonal creeks that have developed on two elongate hills called drumlins. These drumlins were formed thousands of years ago by glaciers, and largely left as woodlots by European settlers. The spring wildflowers can be spectacular in spring.</p>
<p>The Blue and White Trails take you near areas where the Ferris family’s sugar houses, shingle mill, granary and sheep pens once stood. The Red Trail goes around the back of the second drumlin, taking you past the old W. Cock Brickyard. Little physical evidence remains of these pioneering enterprises but their legacy as the forerunners of today’s vibrant local communities is not forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Ranney Falls Trail - 1 km (0.5 hours), loop, easy, level</strong> </p>
<p>This trail follows the original roadway to Ferris Provincial Park before looping back along the river, where there are magnificent views of the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge and Ranney Falls. The gorge edge habitat supports different vegetation from the rest of the park, including the regionally rare Chinquapin Oak. Look for its unique saw-tooth shape on trees along the trail or on fallen leaves underfoot.  The trail finishes by passing through a restful picnic area, perfect for lunch, or a short break.</p>
<p><strong>River Gorge Trail - 3.5 km (2 hours), loop, easy, parts can be wet in the spring. (Yellow markers)</strong><br/>
This trail offers magnificent views of the Trent River gorge from the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge, before continuing downstream past the old Ferris Quarry and onto the legendary “sheep wash”, now a picnic area. The trail continues south, following the river’s edge for more fantastic views of the Trent River. On your way back upstream the trail travels through meadows and past Ferris’s unique stone fences, some of which have recently been rebuilt.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>The presence of a dam upstream with strong currents prevents swimming at the park but an indoor pool and outdoor natural swimming opportunities are available just a short distance away.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>Two separate 5 km cross-country ski and snowshoe trails give you three options for each trail. Starting at the Main Gate both trails will eventually take you to the Suspension Bridge. Trails are maintained by the Friends of Ferris Park.</p> </div>","<div id=""facilities"">

<p>Most of the park’s campsites are flat, private and some can accommode large trailers. Over half the sites offer electrical service in two campgrounds on the north shore of Halfway Lake.</p>
</div>","<div id=""activities"">
<h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Bald Eagles, osprey, many species of woodpecker and a variety of northern songbirds, like the Yellow Warbler, are common sightings in the park.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Halfway Lake is ideal for smaller watercraft and offers a boat launch. All other lakes in the park have motor restrictions.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p><strong>Two Narrows Canoe Route</strong><br/>
The Two Narrows Canoe Route begins on Halfway Lake and travels south into Bailey Lake. It is here that you can see nesting Bald Eagles, a Great Blue Heron rookery and the origins of the 2007 forest fire. From there a series of portages and small lakes takes you deep into the heart of the park. The landforms and vegetation in the Two Narrows Lake area is the central natural heritage feature of the park. Ground moraines created by glaciers thousands of years ago lie on top of rolling bedrock cloaked in forests dominated by jack pine, white birch and poplar. The canoeist can then travel back from Trapper Lake along the original route or through Benny Lake. This canoe route can be competed in one day but there are interior campsites for those who wish to spend more time enjoying the solitude. Dawn and dusk offer excellent wildlife viewing opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Antrim Lake Canoe Route</strong><br/>
Located at the northern edge of the park, Antrim Lake is accessed on the east side of highway 144. This day trip offers spectacular scenery including tall cliffs and ample wildlife viewing opportunities. There are a number of secluded sandy beaches that offer quiet picnicking and swimming opportunities.</p> <h2>Discovery Program</h2>
<p>Join park staff for a Discovery Drop-in during the months of July &amp; August.  Bring along your Discovery Activity Book (or pick one up at the Drop-in), and use the equipment and materials provided to explore the park, observe plants and animals, and discover the wonders of nature.  Be sure to share your observations with park staff, take the Discovery Ranger Pledge and receive your very own Discover Ranger Button!

<p>Halfway Lake provides anglers some excellent fishing opportunities for Small-mouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye and Lake Trout.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p><strong>Moose Ridge Trail - Rating: Moderate - Length: 2 km, 0.5-1 hour</strong><br/>
This trail winds along Raven Lake and up and over a small glacial ridge. This is an excellent trail for families and offers exceptional scenic vistas.  </p>
<p><strong>Echo Pond Trail - Rating: Moderate - Length: 6 km, 1.5 hours</strong><br/>
This trail extends from Moose Ridge and continues along Raven Lake and over part of a steeper ridge system. The trail then wanders north along the west shore of Echo Pond where grassy wetlands provide an ideal place for sighting wildlife. Beaver, mink and the majestic moose are regular visitors to this area. Echo Pond Trail connects to the much longer Hawk Ridge Trail. Be sure to watch the trail signsso that you are not hiking onto the longer trail!</p>
<p><strong>Hawk Ridge Trail - Rating: Difficult - Length: 15 km, 6-8 hours</strong><br/>
This is the longest and most difficult hiking trail in the park.  Hawk Ridge extends off the northern portion of Echo Pond Trail and travels deep into the heart of the interior. The trail passes through part of the forest devastated by the 2002 tornado when mature trees were instantaneously flattened. The trail visits several lakes including tiny Lost Lake with several low cliffs that provide great vantage points. One of the highlights of the trail is the lookout over Three Island Lake. It alone is worth the trip. There are a few interior campsites located along the last stretch of the trail that the weary hiker can rest for the night. * Interior camping fees apply.</p>
<p><strong>Osprey Heights Trail - Rating: Moderate to Difficult - Length: 6 km, 2 hours</strong><br/>
Located on the east side of Highway 144, towards the north end of the park, this trail starts across a short section of low wetland forest before climbing sharply up into the rugged rocky hills of the Canadian Shield. The trail meanders east through mossy clearings, forests and along cliff tops to the edge of Antrim Lake. The Osprey Heights Lookout provides a superb view from over 50 metres above Antrim Lake. This is a great photo opportunity and an ideal place to stop for lunch. The trail then loops back west.</p>

Ontario Parks wants everyone to have a safe and enjoyable time when visiting the park no matter what activity you participate in. We ask that all visitors be responsible and prepared for whatever activity you plan on participating in at the park.

Plan Ahead

Plan your route and learn the park regulations. Let someone know what your travel plans are and when you plan to be back. Whenever possible, schedule your trip to avoid times of high use.

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>Biking is available on park roads and the bike trail along the Chikanishing Creek to the Chikanishing Access Point.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>The park contains a wide variety of habitats for forest songbirds, birds of prey and waterfowl. The park hosts a Christmas bird count, as well as spring and summer Loon counts. Park Naturalists can direct birders to good locations and can help to identify the birds you’ve seen.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Only canoeing and kayaking is permitted on the interior lakes. There is a boat launch at the Chikanishing Access Point for kayak and boat access to Georgian Bay.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>With just under 645 square kilometres of backcountry wilderness and 183 campsites situated on over 50 lakes, Killarney offers numerous canoe routes that can be explored for only a day or for over a week. The deep clear lakes, nestled between the impressive white hills of the La Cloche range, are a canoeist’s dream. </p>
<p>Pick up a guide and a map detailing 11 of the more popular canoe routes and backcountry campsites in the park.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Many of Killarney’s lakes are fish sanctuaries. However, limited fishing opportunities are available in the park’s eastern and northern sections.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>All Killarney’s hiking trails cover uneven and rocky terrain. Sturdy footwear, plenty of water and a park map and compass is recommended. Killarney Provincial Park offers five day-use hiking trails plus may other hiking opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Chikanishing Trail 3 km (1.5 hours) moderate </strong><br/>
This trail winds along the park’s southern boundary and crosses a series of small ridges and then ending at a wave-washed point on Georgian Bay. Vegetation is typical of the rocky, windswept terrain of Georgian Bay, though taller pine and oak have flourished in wind-sheltered spots where soil has accumulated. Old iron rings used for mooring lines during logging days can still be seen along the trail. Interpretive plaques tell the colourful history of this part of Georgian Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Cranberry Bog Trail 4 km (2.5 hours) moderate </strong><br/>
Hikers along the trail pass some of the park’s loveliest scenery. Bogs, marshes and swamps are home to Sundew, Leatherleaf, Pitcher Plant and Cranberry. Beaver feed piles can be seen along the way. Many birds frequent this trail’s habitats and Blanding’s Turtles make an occasional appearance in Cranberry Bog. Look for evidence of glaciation—smooth rock surfaces, striations and chatter marks. </p>
<p><strong>Granite Ridge Trail 2 km (1 hour) moderate</strong><br/>
 Providing views of the unique La Cloche Mountains for which Killarney is renowned the trail winds through old fields and forests and climbs to a ridge with two lookouts over the park. To the south, your eye moves along the shore from Collin’s Inlet and Philip Edward Island to the expanse of Georgian Bay. To the north, see the spectacular La Cloche Mountains. </p>
<p><strong>Lake of The Woods Trail 3.5 km (3 hour) moderate to difficult</strong><br/>
This loop trail encircles Lake of the Woods, traveling through a variety of forest types, from old growth stands to elevated rocky outcrops. These outcrops offer excellent views of Silver Peak, six kilometres to the west and Lake of the Woods below. At one point, the trail descends to the lakeshore where a short boardwalk connects to the lake’s only island.</p>
<p><strong>The Crack 6 km (4 hour), difficult </strong><br/>
The view from the top of Killarney Ridge is absolutely stunning. The immense white cliffs of the La Cloche Mountains surround you as you ascend through the cascade of huge tumbled boulders of what is known as""The Crack”. Once you reach the top of the ridge, you’ll be treated to beautiful panoramic vistas on all sides – certainly one of the best views in the park! </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not try to reach the Crack unless you are in good shape and can get an early start.</p>
<p><strong>La Cloche Silhouette Trail 80 km loop (7-10 days) strenuous </strong><br/>
Although this trail takes up to 10 days to do in its entirety, hikers can take shorter trips starting from two trailheads in George Lake Campground. (Day hikers should leave sufficient time to retrace their steps along the trail back to the campground.)</p>
<p>The west section of this trail is moderate, heading to Acid and Lumsden lakes over rolling forested hills. It crosses small streams and rivers, occasionally following the rocky shores of small lakes. Keep on the lookout for wildlife or clues of their presence.</p>
<p>The east section of this trail heads uphill to the Crack, a ridge with a vista of rugged and scenic landscapes. Considered strenuous, this section passes through forests and wetlands and over rocky ridges. It takes 12 hours of steady hiking and you have to climb over large boulders to reach the top of the ridge. Do not try to reach the Crack unless you are in good shape and can get an early start.</p> <h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Hunting is prohibited in the vast majority of Killarney Provincial Park. Hunting is permitted in Killarney Lakelands and Headwaters Provincial Park and in Killarney Provincial Park 2006 additions ONLY. Nature reserve zones are excluded.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p>Natural Heritage Education programs are offered during July and August at the George Lake Campground. Programs are varied, ranging from guided hikes, children’s programs, evening amphitheatre programs, art-in-the-park and artist-in-residence programs. The park also boasts a small observatory and hosts guest astronomers throughout the summer.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>Swim at two beaches in the campground or in any of the interior lakes and rivers.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>Killarney Provincial Park has 33km of trail winding through parts of the park only accessible through the winter months.</p><ul>
<li>Chikanishing Trail (Classic and Skate: 8km) - This linear track-set trail meanders along the picturesque Chikanishing Creek. Snow-covered evergreen forests line the trail providing beauty and a peaceful escape from the winds.</li>
<li>Collins Inlet Trail (Classic: 14.3km) - This loop trail is packed, but not always track set. As you pass through mature pine forests, open fields and frozen-over marshlands, don’t forget to take a break and enjoy the serenity of this remarkable landscape.</li>
<li>Freeland (Classic: 12.4km) - This linear track-set trail winds east through open hardwood and coniferous forest, past Cranberry Bog and onto scenic Freeland Lake.</li>

<h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater protects an area of rugged highland watersheds and contains forest that mixes Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and Boreal species of trees, creating many different habitats for birds. During the nesting season of spring and early summer, many species of warbler, thrush, flycatcher and woodpecker can be heard calling to defend territory. Eagles, osprey and many other birds-of-prey can be spotted hunting above the forests of the park.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Within Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, motorboat restrictions apply. Please refer to the Temagami Area Park Management Plan 2007 for zone-specific management direction.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>There are numerous canoe route options within Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and in connection with the adjoining waterway parks, conservation reserves and Crown land.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Evelyn River:</strong> this waterway is the central feature in the park, with a north branch that is road-accessible, and a south branch that is only reached from other canoe routes or by floatplane. The north branch starts in a chain of lakes, with the road ending at Gamble Lake. The south branch begins at remote Florence Lake. The two branches meet and the river begins to drop in elevation more steeply, with rapids and falls, skirted by rugged portages beneath the pines. The river passes through a 1990s forest fire, along with several lakes including Katherine, once known as Divide Lake, where the river splits again.<br/>
<br/>
The South Channel is longer and more rugged, with several high falls and challenging portages. The North Channel is shorter, with three large waterfalls. The route either ends in a floatplane trip back to the town of Temagami, or a paddle through several large lakes, Willow Island, Sucker Gut and Lady Evelyn Lake, to the access at Mowat Landing. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Makobe River:</strong> This route is a whitewater trip on a small northern river. It begins in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater, by portaging up the Grays River from the Lady Evelyn River, or by flying into Makobe Lake, the route’s headwaters. The river is best paddled in Spring for rocking whitewater, but can be done with more portaging later on in the season. The Makobe is quite remote, but also short, good for a long weekend, ending at the Montreal River at the town of Elk Lake.</p>
<p>A longer version of this trip, minus the fly-in option, includes a chain of lakes west of Makobe, including Trethewey, or another chain of lakes and streams south of Trethewey. Both of these options are accessed via the former Liskeard Lumber Road.</p>
<p><strong>Smoothwater Lake to Scarecrow Lake:</strong> This route provides canoe access to Ishpatina Ridge, Ontario’s highest elevation. The route begins on Crown land on the Montreal River, heads south through Lady Dufferin Lake and into the park. Smoothwater Lake is large, with a curving sandy east shore. An alternate route to the Lady Evelyn River turns east through several lakes and has very long portages. Along this route lie the “Aurora Trout Lakes”, a nature reserve and fish sanctuary, where the extremely rare Aurora trout is found, native to only this place. Fishing is prohibited in this sanctuary.</p>
<p>The route to Scarecrow Lake follows another chain of lakes in a broad valley, hemmed in by high hills. Ishpatina Ridge is one of these sets of hills. It is the highest point in Ontario, and can be reached by a 3.2 km trail from the shore of Scarecrow Lake. The trail leads from the site of a cabin used by the fire ranger who spent summers watching for smoke from the fire tower on the ridge, before floatplanes became the common method for forest fire spotting.</p>
<p>The canoe route continues through lakes and portages to join the Sturgeon River, a waterway park to the south. Paddling from Scarecrow Lake back to the put-in on the Montreal River is a good linear trip of several days.</p>
<p><strong>Other routes:</strong> <br/>
The main routes described above all connect with other parks, conservation reserves and canoe routes on Crown land. The Sturgeon River and the lakes of Solace Provincial Park connect to form an almost-circular route back into Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater. Pinetorch Lake Conservation Reserve, a very remote and challenging lake-to-lake route connects Florence Lake in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater with Wakimika Lake in the Obabika Lake waterway park. In fact, routes of a week, two weeks or even three can be created linking this park with the rest of the two thousand lakes and 2400km of routes in Temagami.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Angling is primarily for Brook trout and Lake trout in many of the lakes and streams in the park. Sucker Gut Lake contains warm-water species such as Walleye and Small-mouth bass. Ontario provincial fishing regulations apply.</p>
<p>First “discovered” by anglers in the high lakes of Temagami in the 1920s, the Aurora Trout was named for its brilliant red-purple colouration along its sides. The “Aurora Trout Lakes”, Whitepine and Whirligig, were the only known lakes to contain this unique genetic variation of the wide-spread Brook trout. These two small lakes became separated from other watersheds 10,000 years ago, as glacial meltwaters receded, leaving these perched lakes in the Temagami highlands remote from other trout populations, allowing the Aurora trout to develop in isolation.</p>
<p>The “Aurora Trout Lakes” allowed the trout there to evolve their unique colouration, but lay atop bedrock that would eventually threaten their existence. Industrial pollution and acid rain made a serious impact on the two lakes – the acidity was so high the trout could no longer successfully reproduce. The bedrock the lakes sit on could not reduce the acidity like other types of bedrock can, so the trout disappeared from the lakes.</p>
<p>Extinction was averted, however, due to the foresight of the biologists at the nearby Hills Lake Fish Hatchery. They had taken some fish from the lakes to develop a breeding program as the water quality declined, and decades later were able to re-establish the Aurora Trout in the original lakes, once the acidity had been reversed by adding huge quantities of lime to the water.</p>
<p>The original “Aurora Trout Lakes”, Whitepine and Whirligig have been designated as fish sanctuaries. Whitepine and Whirligig, as well as Little Whitepine Lake and Aurora Lake, are within a designated nature reserve zone.</p>
<p>Angling for Aurora trout is permitted in stocked lakes in Ontario – see provincial fishing regulations for the list of lakes.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p><strong>Maple Mountain Trail: 3.2km</strong><br/>
This challenging trail leads to one of the most visited backcountry destinations in Temagami. A 2.5 hour hike leads to a fire tower on the summit where the view of Temagami is breathtaking. The trail can only be reached by canoe and once was used by fire rangers who used the fire tower to watch for smoke and forest fires.</p>
<p><strong>Ishpatina Ridge Trail: 3.2 km</strong><br/>
Crowned as Ontario’s highest elevation, this challenging 3.2 kilometre hike will not disappoint. The Ishpatina Ridge and its fire tower is a 2 hour hike from Scarecrow Lake. Scarecrow can only be reached by canoe.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>

<!--Lake Superior Provincial Park has approximately 200 backcountry campsites, accessible along hiking trails and canoe routes. All backcountry campsites are available on a first-come basis (backcountry/interior campsites cannot be reserved). Camping is permitted on designated sites only. If you are not able to make it to the next campsite, or if your destination campsite is occupied, you may have to camp in a non-designated site, but avoid making a fire (use a stove for cooking) and leave no evidence that you have camped there.

Backcountry campers require an Interior Camping & Vehicle Permit. See the Dates & Fees page for pricing. The permit covers your campsite and vehicle, so you don’t need a daily vehicle permit on top of this. Your permit also covers your vehicle for day-use anywhere in the park on your departure day, until 10 pm.

<h2>Car Camping</h2>
<p>Lake Superior Provincial Park offers camping in two campgrounds with one quarter of all sites providing electrical service. Reservations are available for sites at Agawa Bay and Rabbit Blanket Lake Campgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>Campgrounds:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rabbit Blanket Lake Campground</strong> is situated on an inland lake with a small beach area. The forest is mixed allowing for some shaded sties and some more open. The campground is close to Hwy 17. There are 60 sites, 20 of which are electrical. There is a comfort station with flush toilets, showers and laundry and a trailer dump and fill station. </p>

<p>Note: Crescent Lake campground is closed.</p>
<h2>Radio-Free Camping</h2>
<p>The south portion of Agawa Bay Campground is radio-free (all campsites in the 300s).</p>
</div>","<div id=""activities"">
<h2>Birding</h2>
<p>The diversity of habitats in the park provides good bird watching opportunities. The transition between the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and boreal forests support a mix of northern and southern species.<br/>
<br/>
More than 250 bird species have been identified within the park, 120 - 130 of which nest here. Spring and fall are good times to watch for migrating species, especially close to Lake Superior.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Powerboats are allowed on Lake Superior (no motor size restriction) and Sand Lake (motor size 10 hp or less). Powerboats, including electric motors, are prohibited on all other lakes in the park.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>There are eight canoe routes in the park, ranging from easy day trips to the 56 km Sand River. On the Lower Agawa River and Anjigami River routes only the portions within the park are maintained. The topography of Lake Superior Provincial Park is rugged. Consequently, portaging must be done frequently, and the portages can be steep and uneven. </p>
<p>Individual canoe route descriptions and maps are available in pdf format in the Maps tab. Following is a brief description of the routes in the park. Portage lengths are in metres (1 metre = 3.3 feet or 1.1 yards).</p>
<p>The kilometre location along Hwy. 17 is given for each canoe route (markers are located every 2 km). Agawa Bay Campground is at km 1105.5 and Rabbit Blanket Lake Campground is at km 1049.6.</p>
<p><strong>Fenton-Treeby</strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> 16 km (10 mi) loop; day trip or relaxing overnight trip; 11 portages, 150 m or less;<br/>
<strong>Access:</strong> via Hwy. 17 <br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> This loop travels through six lakes in the boreal forest fringe at the north end of the park and is excellent for novice canoeists who are leery of long portages. Treeby Lake with its pine covered islands is quite scenic.</p>
<p><strong>Rabbit Blanket Lake</strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> Rabbit Blanket Lake to Surf Lake and return; 16 km (10 mi); overnight trip; 3 portages (250 to 1200 m) <br/>
<strong>Access:</strong> Rabbit Blanket Lake Campground (Hwy. km 1049.6) <br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> A good trip for Brook Trout fishing, the route follows the South Old Woman River upstream from Rabbit Blanket Lake. There are three demanding portages into Peat, Sundstrom and Surf Lakes.</p>
<p><strong>Belanger Lake</strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> Belanger and return: 13 km (8 mi); day trip or relaxing overnight trip; 4 portages (300 to 500 m) <br/>
<strong>Access:</strong> Gargantua Road (Hwy. km 1070.3); 2.3 km (1.4 mi) from Hwy. 17 <br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> A family or anglers’ canoe route. What it lacks for experienced canoeists is balanced by pleasant scenery and good Brook Trout fishing. Belanger Lake also supports Lake Trout.</p>
<p><strong>Crescent Lake</strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> 3 km (1.9 mi) loop; 4 hours; 4 portages (60 to 350 m) <br/>
<strong>Access:</strong>Kenny Lake at Hwy.17 (Hwy km 1113.8)<br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> This nice, family trip is an easy route introducing canoeists to lake travel and portaging. Fishing for Brook Trout and Lake Trout is good.</p>
<p><strong>Gamitagama Lake – Old Woman Lake – Sand River</strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> This is the recommended route to Old Woman Lake – from Gamitagama south through a chain of small lakes. The former route from Mijinemungshing Lake through Mirimoki to Old Woman can be difficult due to low water levels. Allow 2 - 3 days for a return trip, or continue on through several lakes to the Sand River (allow 4 - 6 days). <br/>
<strong>Access:</strong> Gamitagama Road (Hwy km 1062.9); parking is limited at the Gamitagama access point <br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> This route includes some of the most interesting lake and river (Sand River) scenery the park has to offer. Many of the lakes on this route offer good Brook Trout fishing. There are Lake Trout in Gamitagama and Old Woman Lakes. Caution: wind and waves on Gamitagama and Old Woman Lakes can make canoeing more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Mijinemungshing Lake </strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> Mijinemungshing Lake is the largest inland lake in Lake Superior Provincial Park. Note: Water levels may be low between Mijinemungshing and Mirimoki Lakes. Old Woman Lake can also be accessed through Gamitagama Lake <br/>
<strong>Access:</strong> From Hwy. 17 via Mijinemungshing Road (Hwy km 1058.0) <br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> A day trip on Mijinemungshing makes for a nice introduction to the interior, or backcountry of Lake Superior Provincial Park. A number of campsites allow for overnight trips. There are portages into several other lakes – Almonte and Maquon. Due to the size of Mijinemungshing Lake, wind and waves can pose problems.</p>
<p><strong>Sand River</strong><br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> Sand Lake, adjacent to the Algoma Central Railway, to take-out near the end of the Sand River. 56 km (35 mi); 5 days; 29 marked portages (9 to 1100 m; average. length 270 m). There is an average of one portage every 2 km (1.2 mi); these are mostly class 1 and 2 rapids. <br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> A scenic river which runs through the park from the northeast corner to Lake Superior. The scenery changes from lowland forest and wetlands to hardwood hills and cliffs. As the river drops about 185 m (600 feet) in elevation from Sand Lake to Lake Superior, there are stretches of fast water, boulder rapids and scenic waterfalls. Water levels vary greatly from month to month and from year to year, depending on the precipitation. Wildlife that may be seen include: moose, beaver, osprey, Sandhill Crane and a variety of warblers. Brook Trout fishing is good along the Sand River. Caution: some dangerous rapids and two waterfalls, Calwin and Lady Evelyn Falls. </p>
<p><strong>Lake Superior Coastline</strong> <br/>
<strong>Route:</strong> Michipicoten River to Agawa Bay; 105 km (65 mi) linear; 5 to 7 days <br/>
<strong>Access:</strong> Canoes and kayaks can be launched north of the park at Michipicoten Bay and Michipicoten River or within the park at Old Woman Bay, Gargantua Harbour, Katherine Cove, Sinclair Cove and Agawa Bay Campground.<br/>
<strong>Highlights:</strong> For those with experience, paddling the coast of Lake Superior is spectacular. The scenery is dramatic, varying from sheer cliffs to fine sand beaches. Much of the shoreline is rock outcrop, boulders or cobble beaches, providing some good exposure to the area’s geology. For the most part, the coast is extremely rugged with few sand beaches or protected areas for refuge from storms, particularly north of Gargantua Harbour. Only experienced paddlers should attempt travelling on Lake Superior. Caution is advised; the lake is extremely cold and the weather unpredictable. Fog may persist for several days. Winds change and waves can develop quickly. Sheltered coves and beaches for landing are limited, especially north of Chalfant Cove. Stay close to shore and be aware of changing conditions. Be prepared to be wind-bound one out of four or five days. </p>
<p><strong>Agawa Bay to Gargantua: 45 km (28 mi)<br/>
Gargantua to Old Woman Bay: 36 km (22 mi)<br/>
Old Woman to Michipicoten River: 24 km (15 mi) </strong></p>

<p>In Lake Superior and in coastal streams and rivers, there are good populations of Lake and Rainbow Trout, and three species of salmon. Inland waters offer good opportunities for catching Lake and Brook Trout. To prevent the introduction on non-native species, the use and possession of live-bait fish (live minnows) is banned on interior park lakes.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>Eleven trails let visitors explore the variety of landscapes that make up Lake Superior Provincial Park – rocky shores, beaches, lakes and rivers, waterfalls, forests, wetlands and rolling hills. </p>
<p>The park terrain is rugged and weather can be variable. It is recommended to carry ample water, bug spray, sunscreen, first-aid supplies and weatherproof gear. </p>
<p>A can and bottle ban is in effect for food and beverage containers in all backcountry areas (Campgrounds and Day-use Picnic Areas along the Highway 17 corridor are exempt).</p>
<p><strong>Trail Ratings</strong><br/>
Trails are marked with blue and white hiking symbols. Portions of a trail may be obstructed by fallen trees, flooding due to beaver activity, high water levels or erosion. When wet, trails may be slippery, especially in rocky and steep areas. Sturdy footwear is recommended. Trail lookouts provide panoramic vistas of the park – approach these cliff areas with caution. </p>
<p>Trail ratings consider the terrain and the length of the trail. (1 km = 0.62 miles). </p>

To complete the Orphan Lake Trail, follow the Baldhead River upstream, past the waterfalls. The trail then climbs to the east shore of Orphan Lake before joining with the trail back to the trailhead.</p>
<p><strong>Pinguisibi (Sand River) (Hwy km 1090.6)<br/>
Easy; 6 km (3.7 mi) return, linear trail; 1½ - 3 hrs </strong></p>
<p>Pinguisibi is the Ojibwe name for “river of fine white sand”. This river is an ancient travel route used by the Ojibwe as they hunted, fished and trapped northwards into the interior. </p>
<p>The first waterfall is a short hike upstream. The trail continues along the Sand River, past two more waterfalls, rapids and quiet sections of the river. The trail ends near portage 28 of the Sand River Canoe Route. Return along the same route. </p>
<p><strong>Agawa Rock Pictographs (Hwy km 1098.0) <br/>
Moderate; 0.5 km (0.3 mi) loop; .1/2 - 1 hour</strong></p>
<p>Generations of Ojibwe recorded their dreams and spirits in red ochre paintings at this sacred site. The trail is short, but rugged, descending through rock chasms and broken boulders. </p>
<p>The Pictographs are accessed from a rock ledge at the edge of Lake Superior and can only be viewed when the lake is calm. The site is open from mid-May to mid-September. Caution is advised when venturing onto this rock ledge due to its slope and the unpredictable nature of Lake Superior and its wave action. For more information refer to the Agawa Rock Pictographs brochure.</p>
<p><strong>Awausee (Hwy km 1101.4)<br/>
Demanding; 10 km (6.2) loop; 4 - 6 hours<br/>
To the first lookout and return is 45 minutes</strong><br/>
<br/>
Climb the Awausee for a bird’s-eye view of the Agawa Valley and Lake Superior. This demanding trail starts at the base of Agawa Mountain and follows an old logging road before veering uphill along a ravine. The first lookout (45 min return hike) offers a view of the lower Agawa River Valley and Agawa Mountain. </p>
<p>Continue climbing through maple forests to a series of lookouts, 200 metres (650 ft.) above the Agawa Valley. Descend along the creek to join up with the old logging road and back to the trail’s beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Towab (Hwy km 1103.8)<br/>
Very Demanding; 24 km (15 mi) return, linear; 8 - 14 hours</strong> <br/>
<br/>
The trailhead is located 3.5 km (2 mi) along the Frater Road. The hike to Agawa Falls and return is recommended as an overnight trip. There are several campsites along the way. Much of the trail is alongside the river, however there are several steep ascents and descents. Shorter hikes can be taken to Burnt Rock Pool (moderate; 2 - 4 hours return) or further upstream; retrace your steps to return. </p>
<p>At the turn of the century, visitors were often guided by Towabanasay (Tow-a-ban-a-say), often called Towab, an Ojibwe guide who held the hunting rights to a 1,300 square kilometre area which included the Agawa River.</p>
<p>The trail ends at Agawa Falls, one of the highest waterfalls in the park (25 metres; 82 ft.) </p>
<p><strong>Crescent Lake (Hwy km 1113.8)<br/>
Easy; 2 km (1.2 mi) loop; 1/2 - 1 hour</strong></p>
<p>Beginning at Crescent Lake Campground the trail takes you through a forest of Yellow Birch which is at least 80 years old and century old pines. You’ll pass by Crescent, MacGregor and Mudhole Lakes, part of the Crescent Lake Canoe Route. This is an ideal hike for families and nature enthusiasts.</p>
<p><strong>Coastal <br/>
Very Demanding; 65 km (40 mi) linear; 5 - 7 days (entire trail)</strong></p>
<p>A number of access points make it possible to spend one or several days hiking the Coastal Trail. Access points are located at: Agawa Bay, Sinclair Cove, Katherine Cove, Coldwater River, Orphan Lake Trail and Gargantua Road. The Park Map is recommended for those hiking the coast. <br/>
<br/>
The most challenging and demanding trail in the park, the Coastal Trail takes you along the high cliffs and rocky beaches of Lake Superior. The trail extends from Agawa Bay to Chalfant Cove.</p>
<p>The trail ascends and descends over cliffs and rocky outcrops and crosses beaches of boulders and driftwood. Use extreme caution when hiking this difficult terrain. The rocks can be very slippery, especially when wet with dew, fog or rain. Windblown trees may obstruct the trail.  </p>
<p>Blue, diamond-shaped symbols mark where the trail enters forested areas. Rock cairns mark exposed sections. Generally the trail hugs the coastline. If you lose the trail, continue along the shore and eventually you will find the trail again.</p>
<p>Gargantua is the main access point for the Coastal Trail. The 14 km (8.7 mi) gravel road from Highway 17 to the parking lot at Lake Superior is rough so allow 45 minutes. </p>
<p><strong>Gargantua North: <br/>
Gargantua to Warp Bay: Easy; 5 km (3.1 mi)  <br/>
Warp Bay to Devil’s Chair: Easy; 2 km (1.2 mi)<br/>
Gargantua to Chalfant Cove: Moderate; 7 km (4.3 mi) </strong> <br/>
(Note: the above distances are one-way only; return along the same routes to Gargantua Harbour.)</p>
<p><strong>Gargantua South: Very Demanding		<br/>
Gargantua to Orphan Lake Trail: 20 km (12.4 mi) <br/>
Orphan Lake to Katherine Cove: 11 km (6.8 mi)<br/>
Katherine Cove to Sinclair Cove: 14 km (8.7 mi)<br/>
Sinclair Cove to Agawa Bay: 10 km (6.2 mi)</strong></p>
<p>South of Gargantua, the Coastal Trail is extremely rugged and very demanding. Between Gargantua and Rhyolite Cove the trail climbs over 80 metres (260 ft.) to spectacular vistas over the lake. </p>
<p>The park’s geology is most dramatic on the coast where waves have exposed the rock shoreline. Rhyolite and Beatty coves are particularly interesting. Along the way, sand and cobble beaches are nestled in coves, providing shelter for campsites.</p>
<p>All backcountry campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Campsites along the coast are shared by hikers and paddlers. </p>

Makobe-Grays River Provincial Park,"The Makobe River is one of the wild whitewater rivers that flow from the headwaters contained in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.
In the high water levels of spring and early summer, many of the numerous rapids may be run as Class I and ll by skilled whitewater paddlers, for a short but challenging trip.
The Makobe River has cut a series of narrow canyons through shield bedrock as it flows northward from the height of land to the Montreal River.
During summer, canoeing consists mainly of flatwater with some moving water, lining and numerous portages.
This waterway park offers numerous small waterfalls, scenic ravines and fishing.","Backcountry Camping
When flying into Makobe Lake, the time required preparing for the flight, and the flight itself mean that camping on Banks Lake is the likely end to the first day. There are several campsites on Banks, including one where the Makobe River starts, next to the first falls. Alexander Lake has a number of campsites for the second night, although camping next to a rapid is often a great way to get to sleep. The last day ends at the Town of Elk Lake.

<h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater protects an area of rugged highland watersheds and contains forest that mixes Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and Boreal species of trees, creating many different habitats for birds. Makobe-Grays protects a similar although narrower forest, where many of the same species of birds can be seen. During the nesting season of spring and early summer, many species of warbler, thrush, flycatcher and woodpecker can be heard calling to defend territory. Eagles, osprey and many other birds of prey can be spotted hunting above the forests of the park. Keep an eye open for birds around the campsite in the morning and at the end of the day.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Motorboats are permitted on Alexander Lake only.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Canoeists travelling the Makobe River come for challenging whitewater. The river itself is a short trip, two or three days of paddling if flying into Makobe Lake by floatplane, and taking-out at the Town of Elk Lake.</p>
<p>The rapids and drops along the river are technical and require scouting. Water conditions early in the season depend on the snowmelt and early trippers may encounter snowfall and even ice-bound lakes, after very cold winters. Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and the Makobe River are higher in elevation than the surrounding areas, like Elk Lake and Temagami. A number of cliff-side locations retain ice and snow into late May.</p>
<p>The Makobe route can also be combined with other routes, primarily those of Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater where the Makobe River begins. The Grays River to the south connects to the Lady Evelyn River, and the Makobe flows into the Montreal River. These can be linked to Lady Evelyn Lake, forming a circle route but only when there are high water conditions.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Brook trout are the most abundant species on this river.</p> <h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>Hunting restrictions apply. Please refer to the Temagami Area Park Management Plan 2007 for zone specific management direction.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>

<p>Misery Bay is such a diverse place, with many different bird habitats. Keen birders and casual observers will see many species of warblers that nest in the park, like Northern Parula, Black-throated Green and Yellow-rumped, flycatchers like the Eastern Kingbird, sparrows like the Clay-coloured and LeConte’s, as well as the occasional Bald Eagle or Sandhill Crane.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>

<p><strong> Coastal Alvar Trail - Rating: Moderate - Length: 8km (loop) </strong><br/>
The Coastal Alvar Trail is a large looping trail that takes in the natural features in the eastern side of the park. It travels from the Visitor Centre, past old glacial beaches and dolostone pavements as it makes its way to the present day shoreline. From there, the trail travels almost 3.5km along the Lake Huron alvar coastline until it intersects with the Mac’s Bay Trail. At that point, the Coastal Alvar Trail turns north along a glacial shoreline ridge as you make your way back to the Visitor Centre. </p>
<p><strong> Inland Alvar Trail - Rating: Easy - Length: 5km (loop) </strong><br/>
The Inland Alvar Trail takes you through stands of mixed forest, old glacial beaches and a variety of open alvar pavements. This smaller looping trail offers a number of interpretive segments including the habitat associated with most of the parks rare and threatened plants including Lakeside Daisy (Manitoulin Gold), Blazing Star, Hill’s Thistle and Pitcher Thistle. There is also a short “spur” that will allow the hiker to connect with the Coastal Alvar Trail. </p>
<p><strong> Misery Bay Trail - Rating: Moderate/Difficult - Length: 5km (loop to trail head) </strong><br/>
The Misery Bay Trail begins where the Coastal Alvar Trail hits the Lake Huron coastline. The trail crosses the bayhead wetland along a beautiful sandy outwash as you make your way to the western side of the park. Being that the wetland is so fragile please stay on the trail! Once on the western side of the park the trail features two trail loops that take you through the largest open alvar pavement in the park. Old glacial beaches, alvars, glacial boulders, rare and interesting plants, glacial striations, grykes and erratics are just some of the things you will see. </p>
<p><strong> Mac’s Bay Trail - Rating: Easy - Length: 2km (return to trail head) </strong><br/>
Mac’s Bay Trail extends off the easterly portion of the Coastal Trail and travels to Mac’s Bay Conservation Reserve as it makes its way through shady cedars, across disturbed alvar and along a scarp before coming out on the Mac’s Bay shoreline. The shoreline is open and marshy and is a great place for birding. Features associated with the trail include small alvars, grykes, erratics, the glacial shoreline ridge and of course Mac’s Bay Conservation Reserve.</p>
<p>* Please note all trail distances are approximate.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p>Natural Heritage Education programming is offered through the Friends of Misery Bay. From the globally rare alvar communities to the provincially significant bayhead wetland, the park is home to a number species at risk all of which are featured in the various programs.   </p>

Missinaibi Provincial Park,"A Canadian Heritage River, designated for its significant Indigenous, fur trade and logging cultural heritage, outstanding ecological and geological natural heritage, and wilderness recreation.
A 500 km long provincial park, encompassing large lakes, scenic waterfalls and outstanding whitewater.
A variety of unique camping experiences: Barclay Bay Campground on Missinaibi Lake; interior boat and canoe sites on Missinaibi Lake; backcountry canoe sites on hundreds of kilometers of Missinaibi River.
In the heart of the Chapleau Crown Game Preserve, the world’s largest wildlife preserve

“Big” Missinaibi Lake is a hidden gem, deep in the heart of the largest wildlife preserve in the world. The Barclay Bay Campground docks and boat launch provide access to a lake that is 40 km long, along with Baltic Bay that is 20 km long. All of this water and shoreline means lots of opportunities for exploration. There are 25 interior campsites scattered along the shores of the big lake – each one makes for an ideal backcountry basecamp for boaters and anglers, kayakers and canoeists. Aboriginal rock paintings, historic fur trade posts, abandoned logging camps and old growth Red Pine at its northern limit are some of the places to visit. A backcountry campsite out on the lake is a perfect place for great fishing, wildlife viewing, paddling and just relaxing.
There are five canoe route options located within the park with over 75 backcountry campsites associated with these routes. These are very remote sites, amenities are rustic (a privy toilet, a fire ring and some tent spotss), therefore, self-reliance and backcountry experience is essential.  The Missinaibi River itself is one of the longest and famous of the canoe routes in the Hudson Bay watershed – 500 km of whitewater river, from the Arctic watershed divide down to James Bay.
Car Camping
Barclay Bay boasts large, well-treed campsites in a campground with basic amenities such as water taps, vault privies, trailer dump and fill, animal-proof food storage lockers, a fish cleaning house, an extensive dock system capable of handling larger watercraft and a boat launch. There are no electrical hook-ups or comfort stations at Missinaibi Park as this is a true northern park.
Group Camping
There is one  large, private group campsite located right on the water where you can keep canoes, kayaks and boats moored right at your site. Your group will have your own private washroom complete with a sink with running water.

</div>","<div id=""activities"">
<h2>Birding</h2>
<p>The Missinaibi River flows through the boreal forest, known worldwide as the”Songbird Nursery” of North America. In spring and summer, the boreal forest is such a rich habitat in which to raise young, that forest songbirds like warblers and flycatchers can nest more closely than in other forests and still feed their chicks with enough food. This is the place to see and hear all of these birds in their breeding colours, singing their territorial songs.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Motorboats are allowed on Missinaibi Lake and Brunswick Lake. Motorboats are permitted for anglers flying into Little Missinaibi Lake with one of the registered fly-in outfitters for that lake. Motorboats are permitted seasonally on some sections of the river and all season on others. Check with the park for information on restrictions.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>There are five canoe route options within the park, some requiring train travel for access, with over 75 backcountry campsites associated with these routes. These are very remote sites, amenities are rustic (a privy toilet, a fire ring and some tent spots), therefore, self-reliance and backcountry experience is essential.  The Missinaibi River itself is one of the longest and famous of the canoe routes in the Hudson Bay watershed – 500km of whitewater river from the Arctic watershed divide down to James Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Trip options:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Missinaibi Lake to Mattice- advanced, 7 to 12 days</strong></p>
<p>Start from the Barclay Bay Campground on Missinaibi Lake and end up at the town of Mattice, located north on Highway 11 (arrange to have your vehicle shuttled to that location). A classic pool and drop waterway, this section has some of the best whitewater paddling on this Canadian Heritage River.</p>
<p><strong>Peterbell to Mattice- intermediate to advanced, 7 to 10 days</strong> </p>
<p>A few days shorter than the previous trip (Missinaibi Lake to Mattice), this adventure begins in the town of Foleyet (on Highway 101) where you board the VIA Rail passenger train and dropping you off at the rail-stop of Peterbell, on the Missinaibi River. </p>
<p><strong>Mattice to Moosonee- advanced, 10- 12 days</strong></p>
<p>Starting in the town of Mattice on Highway 11, this route takes you through some of the most spectacular scenery on the river, including Thunderhouse Falls, Stone Rapids and Hell’s Gate, as you transition from the rocky Precambrian shield to the James Bay Lowlands. This is a very remote section of the river, leaving roads far behind as you paddle north to James Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Shumka to Missanabie- novice to intermediate, 5-7 days, circle route</strong></p>
<p>Start in the town of Missanabie where you board the VIA Rail Budd Car that will take you and your gear to a rail-stop called Shumka, south of Bolkow Lake. There are several variations to this route, a lake-to-lake route, however the beauty of any of the options is that they take you right back to where your vehicle awaits you in Missanabie. This route travels through a remote part of the Chapleau Game Preserve.</p>
<p><strong>Missinaibi Lake to Little Missinaibi Lake back to Missinaibi Lake again-novice to intermediate, 7-8 days, circle route</strong></p>
<p>This trip starts at the main campground on Missinaibi Lake where you have the opportunity to explore many of the lake’s highlights along the way. This route combines whitewater when water levels are high enough, with both river and lake-to-lake paddling.</p>

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p><strong>The 14-km Trail  </strong><br/>
Cycling is permitted on the 14 km Lookout Trail. This is a rugged backcountry trail, therefore proper safety precautions, including wearing a bike helmet, should be taken.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Situated in the transition zone between the Great Lakes and Boreal Forest regions, Pancake Bay is home to a variety of wildlife. In the campground look for Red Squirrels, chipmunks, Red fox and several bird species including Pileated and Downy Woodpeckers. On the trails keep a lookout for moose, wolves, Black Bears and birds such as Bald Eagles, Common Loons, Sandhill Cranes, flycatchers and Cedar Waxwings and many forest warblers like redstarts. Over 200 bird species have been recorded in the park. The wetlands within park boundaries provide habitat for a number of amphibians. These include Spring Peepers and Green Frogs,which are sure to be a favourite with younger wildlife enthusiasts.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>There is no boat launch in the park. For access to Lake Superior, boats must be carried into the water or driven to a launch 11 km south, at the mouth of the Batchawana River. Sudden weather changes can occur frequently and can be hazardous.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Paddle the spectacular shoreline of Lake Superior, exploring just as the voyageurs once did. Batchawana Bay is large but relatively sheltered, while north of the park the rugged and rocky Lake Superior shoreline shows how powerful the lake can be. Sudden weather changes that can cause large swells and waves to occur can be hazardous. Always wear your personal flotation device and paddle within your ability.</p> <h2>Discovery Program</h2>
<p>Join park staff for a Discovery Drop-in during the months of July &amp; August.

Located next to the campground, this trail begins along the dramatic Lake Superior shoreline, takes you over forested ancient beach ridges, through a fascinating wetland and then ends along a shallow meandering creek. Highlights of this trail include a boardwalk crossing the wetland, spring and summer wildflowers and a huge billion year-old conglomerate boulder. Interpretive signs posted along the trail will guide you in experiencing the natural features of this walk.</p>
<p><strong>The Lookout Trail – 14 km (5-7 hours) moderate for the entire trail - 7 km return (2-3 hours) to the lookout</strong><br/>
Located across Highway 17 from the campground, this hiking trail takes you through a lush forest dominated by tall Sugar Maples and Yellow Birch. This hike provides you with the best views of Pancake Bay and opportunities to catch a glimpse of the local wildlife, including moose, further on past the lookout. From the lookout you can see across to Whitefish Point. This stretch of Lake Superior is known as the “graveyard of the Great Lakes” where the Edmund Fitzgerald sunk in a fierce Superior storm in 1975. Highlights of this trail include two lookout platforms offering spectacular views of Lake Superior and Pancake Bay, secluded inland lakes where you may hear the call of the loon and the scenic Pancake River Falls.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>This 14-kilometre Savanna Trail follows a wooded path from the Park Store to the traffic circle. It then takes over the left side of the one-way Day-Use Road, along the Old Ausable River Channel, and travels through the wooded landscape to Picnic Area 8. The Savanna Trail then continues by turning into the forest once again. This section of the trail follows a wooded path to the Visitor Centre, where it exits the forest and runs along the left shoulder of the road, over the Store Bridge, taking you back to the Park Store.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Pinery’s rare habitats provide shelter and space for 319 different species of birds, 124 of which have nested in the park.  You can watch the magnificent migration of thousands of Tundra Swans in March or watch warblers pass through in May and June. Observe Red-throated Loons off the beach in the spring, or walk the trails in summer looking for a brilliant Scarlet Tanager, Baltimore Oriole or Cerulean Warbler. In the winter, Red-tailed Hawks and Tufted Titmice are common sights at the Visitor Centre feeders.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>No dedicated cycling trails. The campgrounds are located on a plateau and all campground roads are hard surfaced making it an excellent place to ride bicycles. Roads are busy, so caution is always advised and helmets should be worn.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Port Burwell is one of the best locations along the Lake Erie shoreline to see spring and fall migration. Perhaps the most thrilling aspect is the fall migration of hawks, vultures, and eagles. You can also witness Monarch Butterflies, Blue Jays and dragonflies on their spectacular migration. More than 85 species of migratory birds have been spotted here in the spring and our bird check list includes 232 species. Lake Erie presents a barrier to these seasonal movements so the flow of migrants concentrates at and moves along the shoreline in both the spring and fall. The park is an undiscovered birder’s paradise. It is located centrally between the renowned birding areas of Long Point, Rondeau and Point Pelee so the quantity and quality of birding is excellent.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Boat launching and docking facilities are located near the park with access to Lake Erie available through the Big Otter Creek. It immediately opens into an unprotected section of Lake Erie so boaters should be cautious. The often choppy waters of Lake Erie are excellent for experienced wind surfers.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>

Otter Creek is located just outside the park and has its headwaters north of Tillsonburg.

<p>Angling is excellent in this part of Lake Erie but a boat is recommended, as there are limited fishing opportunities along Big Otter Creek as it enters the lake. Perch, pickerel (walleye), trout and salmon are just a few of the popular sport fish species found in the lake.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p><strong>Ravine Creek Trail 1 km, 45 minutes, easy </strong><br/>

</div>","<div id=""activities"">
<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>With its flat terrain, Presqu’ile is well suited to cycling. There is a dedicated walking/bike lane beside the paved 8 km road loop that provides access to picnic grounds, the visitor centres and trails. An unpaved bicycle path connects the campgrounds with the paved loop, beach and Park Store.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>As a major stopover for migrating birds and monarchs, Presqu’ile is renowned among birdwatchers as one of the premier birding locations in the province. At least 338 species of birds have been spotted within in the park and 130 species are known to nest here. March for waterfowl, May for songbirds and shorebirds and September for shorebirds are highlight months.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>Both Presqu’ile Bay and Lake Ontario are accessible to boats. Please note that during waterbird nesting season you must remain a minimum of 200 m away from the two offshore islands (High Bluff and Gull). Nesting season occurs from March 10 to September 10 inclusive.</p>
<p>There is a municipally run boat launch 1 km east of the park entrance.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Presqu’ile Bay and marsh are sheltered enough to allow canoe exploration. Canoes can be put in at the Camp Office viewing platform or at Calf Pasture picnic area. Canoeing in Lake Ontario is recommended only on the calmest days. Please note that during waterbird nesting season you must remain a minimum of 200 m away from the two offshore islands (High Bluff and Gull). Nesting season occurs from March 10 to September 10 inclusive.</p> <h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>The waters of both Presqu’ile Bay and Lake Ontario are accessible by boat for fishing in season. Land-based fishing can be enjoyed at the Calf Pasture Picnic Ground or just outside the park from the Municipality of Brighton’s “Government Dock”.</p> <h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>Presqu’ile was made for walking; its flat terrain and views of Lake Ontario attract walkers all year. A favourite route for many is the paved one-way driving loop (Lighthouse Lane and Paxton Drive) around the peninsula. This road has a designated walking/bike lane and is plowed in the winter. This is still a road however and walkers are urged to be cautious, particularly in the busy summer months. For those wanting a more natural experience Presqu’ile has 12 km of traditional “off-road” trails. All trails are clearly marked with coloured plastic blazes and are cleared of deadfall on a regular basis. </p>
<p><strong>Jobes’ Woods Trail – 1.0 km, 30 minutes, loop, easy</strong><br/>
This trail winds through an area that was once part of a farm settled by Thomas and Ezekial Jobes in 1835. This part of their farm remained relatively undisturbed by settlement activity and today contains one of the oldest deciduous woodlots at Presqu’ile. </p>
<p>The trail passes by towering old maples, vernal pools crossed by boardwalks, conifer plantations, and an old field which is filling in with ash trees after a century of use by the Jobes family. An interpretive guide introducing visitors to the ecology of the Jobes’ forest is available at the trailhead or can be downloaded in the maps tab. </p>
<p><strong>Owen Point Trail – 1.6 km, 45 minutes, loop, easy</strong><br/>
This trail offers excellent opportunities to see migrating shorebirds along the natural beach and distant views of the waterbird colonies on their island nesting grounds. The trail can be accessed from the south end of the beach or from the west end of High Bluff Campground. </p>
<p>To avoid disturbing migrating birds, the natural beach is closed to foot traffic between ice-out and ice-in, but the trail provides a number of lookouts allowing views of the entire shore. In addition, pets are not allowed into any of the lookouts on this trail at any time, but can be taken on the loop. To protect the nesting waterbirds, access to Gull and High Bluff Islands is closed from March 10 to September 10 inclusive. Gull Island can usually be accessed by foot after September 10 from Lookout #5 of the Owen Point Trail. </p>
<p>An interpretive guide to the ecology of the point and the islands is available at the trailhead or can be downloaded in the maps tab.</p>
<p><strong>Marsh Trail – 1.2 km, 30 minutes, loop, easy</strong> <br/>
This trail includes 800 m of boardwalk complete with two viewing towers and a teaching platform (great for picnics too!) that takes visitors into the marsh. Sixteen interpretive panels along the trail illustrate the story of the marsh and its inhabitants.  The boardwalk portion of the trail is barrier-free.</p>
<p><strong>Pioneer and Newcastle Trails – 8.1 km, 3 hours, two interconnected loops, easy</strong><br/>
These trails lead you through the forests, plantations and old fields found in the heart of the Presqu’ile peninsula.  Along these trails you will encounter a diversity of plants and wildlife in the mature beech-maple forest, old fields and early succession forest which dominate this area of the park.<br/>
<br/>
The Pioneer Trail is 3.8 km and marked by yellow plastic blazes. The Newcastle Trail is 4.3 km and is marked by orange plastic blazes. The trailhead for both trails is halfway along Lighthouse Lane, though there are a number of other access points along both trails.  Both trails use park roadways for part of their length so be cautious of vehicles and monitor children running ahead on the trail. </p>
<p><strong>Lighthouse Foot Path – 300 m, 20 minutes, loop, easy</strong><br/>
This loop connects the Lighthouse Interpretive Centre with the lighthouse itself. There are great views of Lake Ontario and Presqu’ile Bay, with waterfowl in winter and spring, and a cool breeze in summer. Interpretive panels illustrate the history of the area.</p>
<p><strong>Cemetery Trail – 300 m, 15 minutes, linear, easy</strong><br/>
This path connects the cemetery interpretive panel at the Camp Office parking lot with the site of an abandoned pioneer cemetery. The site itself is marked with a commemorative granite boulder, though no other evidence remains.</p> <h2>Hunting</h2>
<p>A regulated waterfowl hunt takes place Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays in the marsh and offshore islands from the fourth Friday in September to the third Saturday in December. Hunting in this park is subject to the Ontario Hunting Regulations. Certain restrictions apply. For more information, contact the park or a Ministry of Natural Resources office.</p> <h2>Natural Heritage Education</h2>
<p>Daily slide talks, guided walks, campfire programs, and children’s programs are held in the summer. Guided walks, conducted bird walks and other nature activities are offered on weekends in the spring and fall.  </p>
<p>Waterfowl Viewing Weekend in mid-March draws thousands of visitors to see thousands of ducks. Volunteer naturalists are on hand each day to operate telescopes, identify the different types of ducks and point out distinguishing field marks. </p>
<p> Warblers and Whimbrels Weekend occurs on the Victoria Day weekend, the traditional peak of spring bird migration. Bird walks, bird banding and evening programs introduce the elusive Whimbrel and the colourful warblers that pass through the park.  </p>
<p>History Weekend, held on the Civic holiday weekend, is an opportunity to relive Presqu’ile’s storied past. Special events, such as old fashioned games, a musical social evening, a boat-building bee and regatta, a BBQ lunch social, history play and historical recreations occur throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>Monarchs and Migrants Weekend, held on Labour Day weekend, offers a chance to see and learn more about migrating Monarch Butterflies, songbirds and shore birds. Park naturalists and guest speakers offer slide talks, shorebird viewing, butterfly tagging demonstrations and special hikes.  </p>
<p>Curriculum-based children’s educational programming is offered by Park Naturalists in the spring and fall for schools and other groups courtesy of the Friends of Presqu’ile. Go to the <a href=""http://www.friendsofpresquile.on.ca/free-school-group-program.php"">Friends website</a> for more information and a registration form.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>A long, safe, sandy beach is ideal for family swimming. Please remember that there are no lifeguards on duty at the beach so children must be supervised.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>Walking is popular all year at Presqu’ile on the paved road loop with a dedicated walking lane.  Self-grooming skiing is available on the 12 km of trails in the park. From the group camping parking lot, two loops head east and west.</p> </div>","<div id=""facilities"">

Can and Bottle Ban: Non-burnable, disposable food and beverage containers are not allowed. Fuel, insect repellent, medicine, personal toiletry (non-food & beverage) containers are permitted only.  
Please carry out all fuel cans
Mechanized Use: It is illegal to possess a motorized boat, power saw, gasoline generator or power ice auger in the park.  No person may use a mechanized portage device, all terrain vehicle, snowmobile or similar mechanized equipment in Quetico Provincial Park.
Party Size:  Nine people is the maximum party size allowed on a campsite.  It is recommended that large parties (any group over 5 people) travel separately across lakes and portages.
Fishing:  Ontario fishing regulations require the use of artificial bait and barbless hooks within Quetico Provincial Park. Live or dead organic bait is not permitted in the park. Examples include leeches, worms and salted minnows. Live and dead bait can introduce invasive aquatic species. Barbed hooks may be pinched to conform to regulation. Reduce fish mortality by using barbless hooks, keep fish handling to a minimum, use proper fish handling techniques, and be aware of fishing regulations.. A valid Ontario fishing licence is required for fishing and must be in your possession. Licences are not available at all park stations and should be purchased prior to your arrival at www.ontario.ca/fishing

Litter: Pack out all non-burnable garbage, including tinfoil. You may not leave any litter in a provincial park, except in a place designated for that purpose.  Likewise, you must keep your interior campsite clean and sanitary at all times.  This will help prevent problems with bears and will also help to preserve Quetico’s wilderness.
Closed Campsites: You may not camp on sites that are closed to camping.  Obey no camping signs.
Quota System:  You must enter Quetico during business hours through the ranger station, on the entry date and entry point designated on your permit.  Do not take unnecessary risks, late arrivals due to high winds will be accommodated.

Historical Sites: Quetico has a number of important archaeological sites within its boundaries.  You may not remove, damage or deface any relic, artifact or natural object or any site of archaeological or historical interest.  You may not disturb these sites, make an excavation for any purpose, or conduct research without written permission from Ontario Parks.
Pictographs: Leave archaelogical, historical and pictograph sites untouched.  The Pictographs in Quetico are spiritually sacred for Anishinabe People.  Approach all pictographs queitly and respectfully. It is illegal to deface these sites or remove objects such as bones, arrowheads, and other artefacts. Quetico’s pictographs are fading. Do not touch the pictographs: Oil and perspiration can accelerate the deterioration of the pigment.
Campfires:  Use existing fire rings. Fire pits must be built on bare rock or bare mineral soil and kept 1.5-3m from vegetation including overhanging trees.  If windy, do not have campfires.  Make sure your fire is out.  Fires are prohibited in a restricted fire zone. Possession or ignition of fireworks in a provincial park is illegal.
Equipment Caching:  It is unlawful to store or leave unattended any watercraft or equipment in the park without the permission of the park superintendent.
Campsite Structures:  Do not build tables, chairs or other structures at your campsite. Please leave the campsite as you found it, taking all your gear with you, including fire grills and grates.
Noise:  Enhance your own experience and the experience of others by keeping noise to a minimum. We also encourage all aircraft to fly 4000 ft. above sea level when possible to help reduce noise levels.

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>There are no dedicated bike trails at Quetico but visitors are welcome to explore the Dawson Trail Campground roads on bicycle.</p> <h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Over 200 bird species have been recorded in Quetico, many of which are migratory. During the summer over 100 species of birds nest in Quetico.  The park is a major breeding ground for birds of prey such as Bald Eagles &amp; osprey.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>Stretching 60 miles from east to west and 40 miles from north to south, Quetico is renowned for its rugged beauty - its towering rock cliffs, majestic waterfalls, virgin pine and spruce forests, picturesque rivers and lakes - and for the best wilderness canoeing in the world. Except for Dawson Trail, the park is accessible only by water. There are no roads; logging is not permitted and regulations help preserve the park’s natural and remote splendour. </p>
<p>Hundreds of lakes and rivers are linked by 550 maintained portages averaging 400 m and provide a wide range of canoeing opportunities from one day to several weeks.  </p>
<p>Some areas of the park are more easily travelled than others. Portages and campsites are not signed. Ask park staff at the ranger stations for the most current information about water levels and portage conditions.</p>
<p>Listed below are suggested routes from each Ranger Station. There are many more routes to take, but this will give first-time users an idea of distance and time. </p>
<p><strong>Dawson Trail Ranger Station:<br/>
Baptism Creek-Cache Lake Loop  - 123 km (6 days) 18 lakes, 20 portages, challenging  </strong><br/>
Baptism Creek is accessible from French Lake in the northeast corner of Quetico. Few visitors venture southeast of the lake. This route is recommended for seasoned trippers who are physically able to surmount two of the park’s most formidable obstacles - the Cache Lake portages. For those who don’t mind backtracking or rugged portages, this entry point offers canoeists a quick escape into wilderness solitude and isolation not found at many other entry points.</p>
<p><strong>Atikokan Ranger Station:  Batchewaung - Twin-Jean-Jesse Loop   - 112 km (6 days) 14 lakes, 18 portages, challenging</strong><br/>
 This popular route features large and small lakes, creeks and easy portages. Upon reaching Pickerel Lake from Batchewaung, steer an easterly course through Pickerel Narrows then head south and southwest through Dore and Twin lakes to gigantic Sturgeon Lake. Near its west end, enter Jean Creek. After paddling north through Burntside and Jean Lakes, bear east on Quetico Lake and continue through Oriana, Jesse and Maria lakes. From there, portage back to Pickerel Lake and return to Nym Lake by reversing the route you followed on the first day.</p>
<p><strong>Beaverhouse Ranger Station:  Cirrus Lake-The Sue Falls Loop  - 40 miles (4 days), 5 lakes, 7 portages, easy </strong><br/>
This loop is ideal for those who prefer long, uninterrupted stretches of paddling, with only an occasional portage for leg-stretching. You paddle from the northeast corner of Beaverhouse Lake and then portage east, first to an unnamed lake and then to Cirrus Lake. With nearly half of the route’s portages behind you, paddle to the east end of Cirrus for a view of scenic Sue Falls. Steer south to the longest and most difficult portage of the trip. Upon reaching Kasakokwog Lake, plot a westerly course down McAlpine Creek to another enormous lake. Paddling close to the north shore of Quetico Lake, don’t miss Anishinabe rock paintings (pictographs) on the sheer granite cliffs. From the west end of Quetico Lake, the Quetico River carries you back to Beaverhouse Lake.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lac La Croix Ranger Station:  McAree Lake, easy</strong><br/>
 McAree Lake is the most convenient of the four entry points accessible from Lac La Croix. From here, it is only three miles to Quetico’s interior. Beyond is some of the most beautiful scenery in the entire Quetico-Superior region. Argo and Crooked Lakes, Curtain Falls, the Siobhan and Darkwater rivers and the pictographs of Darkwater Lake are among the not-too-distant attractions. </p>
<p><strong>Prairie Portage Ranger Station: Carp Lake-Hunter’s Island Loop  - 379 miles (13 days), 25 lakes, 29 portages, easy to challenging</strong><br/>
 If you have two full weeks to spend on the water, this route is scenic, historic and one of the most varied. The lakes and rivers along this loop were part of the Voyageurs’ Highway - the route of the fur traders between Lake Superior and Rainy Lake. Throughout the loop are historic sites where First Nations, prospectors, settlers and loggers left their marks. Counterclockwise is the best direction to paddle the loop, allowing you to take advantage of the Maligne River’s occasional swift current. You should allow one layover day, just in case you get held up by high winds on a large lake.</p>

View Silver Falls at the first portage, then paddle to the north end of Saganagons Lake and begin the journey to the Falls Chain to Kawnipi Lake. After paddling Kawnipi to its northwest end, go south along Kahshahpiwi Creek, through Cairn, Sark and Keefer Lakes, all the way to Kahshahpiwi Lake. From there, portage to McNiece Lake.

<h2>Biking</h2>
<p>One special amenity at Silent Lake is the mountain bike trail. The trail can be accessed from the day-use area parking area. The trail offers two loops; 13 and 19 km in length. The 13 km loop is moderately difficult, while the 19 km loop is considered difficult. Caution should be taken as the trail crosses the park road and is shared track in some portions. The trails are subject to closure during spring/wet conditions.  Please contact park for up to date information.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>While you are visiting the park, you should take a quiet, relaxing paddle across Silent Lake. The lake is approximately 2.5 km in length and is motor-free (gas and electric). The adjoining lakes (Quiet Lake and Soft Lake) can sometimes be accessed (depending on water levels) by completing a short portage that is not maintained by park staff. Canoe and kayak rentals are available at the park throughout the summer season. </p>
<p>A canoe launch is located at the Pincer Bay Canoe Hut and Dock.</p> <h2>Discovery Program</h2>
<p>Join park staff for a Discovery Drop-in during the months of July &amp; August.

<p>Whether you are an ardent hiker, a nature lover, or just out for a family stroll, you’ll find a hiking trail at Silent Lake that suits you. Each of the three trails has the same underlying qualities – the tranquility and solitude of the natural environment. Each one will expand your wilderness experience at Silent Lake and introduce you to the ecology and history of the park area.</p>
<p><strong>Lakehead Loop Trail - 1.5 km, 30 minutes round trip, easy</strong><br/>
This short trail is designed for those who wish to stretch their legs by taking a leisurely walk in natural and peaceful surroundings.

<p><br/>
<strong>Lakeshore Hiking Trail - 15 km, 6 hours round trip, moderate to difficult</strong><br/>
This is a wilderness trail designed for the more experienced hiker. It is rugged, challenging and very rewarding. A supply of water is highly recommended. Sharing the same beginning segment of the Lakehead Loop trail, the Lakeshore Trail roughly follows the undeveloped shoreline of Silent Lake. Along the way you will pass through beaver meadows, hardwood forests, and cedar-black ash swamps. The spectacular lookout points will be the highlight of your hike.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>Visitors to Silent Lake can enjoy swimming at its two sandy beaches. The largest beach is located at the day-use area and includes a large grassy area for enjoying a picnic with your family and friends. The other beach is located in Pincer Bay campground.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>See another side of Silent Lake during the winter season. The park offers cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and ice fishing. Those wanting to stay overnight can try one of the park’s winter yurts or camp cabins.</p>
<p>More than 40 km of cross-country trails wind their way through hardwoods, cedar swamps, groves of White Birch and beech stands. The terrain is rugged, but ideal for family skiing. All four connecting loops start and finish at the day-use parking lot and are colour coded for easy recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Green Loop</strong> - 2.5 km, novice-moderate</p>
<p><strong>Red Loop</strong> - 6 km, novice-moderate</p>

The trail continues to the top of the Dog Falls and up to a lookout over the river valley. The trail beyond the falls goes into the forest which is less worn and leads to a rocky area some people call the “Hoover Dam”. Most people use this trail as a linear trail or park a second car at the lookout if you only want to hike the trail one way. Remember that the water level in the Kaministiquia River is controlled by dams and water levels can change fast without warning.

<h2>Birding</h2>
<p>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and the surrounding waterway parks including Sturgeon River, protect an area of rugged highland watersheds and contain forest that mixes Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and Boreal species of trees, creating many different habitats for birds. During the nesting season of spring and early summer, many species of warbler, thrush, flycatcher and woodpecker can be heard calling to defend territory. Eagles, osprey and many other birds of prey can be spotted hunting above the forests of the park.</p> <h2>Boating</h2>
<p>There are some boating opportunities in this park. Check the park management plan for restrictions.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2>
<p>The Sturgeon River is a week-long whitewater canoe route that provides class I and II whitewater along much of its length. Portages are numerous, but often short – between 50 and 250 metres. Campsites are often found near rapids and waterfalls. Trips often begin at Paul Lake via floatplane or further north on the river where the Portelance timber access road crosses. Route options are varied, but the common route includes the length of the river, and then upstream on the Obabika River and on to Wawiagama Lake, ending the trip with another floatplane flight or down the Goulard Lumber Road (road options require a vehicle shuttle).</p>
<p>As with many of the Temagami canoe routes, many options are available by combining other routes. For longer trips, it is possible to combine the Sturgeon with other park and Crown land routes.</p>

A large buoyed swimming area provides the ideal place for kids to splash and play with the rolling green hills serving as the perfect backdrop for photos.</p> <h2>Winter Activities</h2>
<p>When the snow falls there is no better place to be then right here at Windy Lake Provincial Park. The park offers some of the best cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the region.
