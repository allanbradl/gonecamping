Thank you! Pulled in on a early afternoon for an overnight stay.  Asked what to  do and the staff said to go on a boat ride of the 1000 Islands.  It was wonderful.  Came back to campsite and crashed.  Got a nice quiet rest.  Recommend this campsite. Fantastic as always! The site was excellent and the staff extremely helpful!
Noticed one person complain about the
 water(?) It must have been from their own tank. The water here is perfectly fine and fresh. Train horn wasn't an issue, too far away to be bothersome. And who cares? It has nothing to do with the site!! 
Very family oriented!! No drunk loosers ruining your nights! Will be back again! Thanks Sue and Richard! Very Nice Place. Incredible things for kids to do, as well as adults. Hot tub, pool, laundry, huge store with everything you forgot to bring. Great Staff, kind, friendly. If you need a cabin, they have those too. Very quiet, away from the Hwy. Treed, scenic, great for walking around and unwinding. My only negative was the rather unlevel tenting sites. $51 a night to pitch a tent with no services should at least give you a level site.

Had read about the geocache on the property and figured this could be an interesting first time experience. Can't say enough good about it. Kind of slow day but I did get there a bit later than I had planned.  The burger was good, the beer was cold, and the people, both staff and  members were very cordial.  Spent a fair amount of time just sitting on the deck, talking with everyone and eating.  No qualms about their policy of mandatory nude. As a matter of fact,as I read about other parks, I wonder how the experience could be as good with clothed staff.  Everyone seemed so ""genuine"" and even got to meet the owner as he was going into the office. Only complaint is I don't live close enough!!! (from West Virginia). Thanks for a wonderful experience. Hope to get back there sometime with my RV. We recently spent 5 nights at Bare Oaks and all we can say is good things about this beautiful place.
The grounds, clubhouse , pool, hot tub and facilities in general are well kept and impeccably clean.
We stayed at a Queen room which is not too big but comfy ... a little hot with just the ceiling fan and Karen very kindly provided us with and extra fan, but honestly think it could be way better with at least a small window AC.
Very friendly environment and big koodos for the staff specially for Karen, Alex , Sam and Sue and also Kim/Melissa and John from the Bare Bistro, and sorry if we don't remember or may have omitted some names but the same goes for all of you.
Thank you all for your kindness and for sure we'll be back!!!

Toronto - ON Great  place to camp and visit. I camped here a few weeks back and found that the staff was very friendly and helpful. Park is very clean and well maintained. Great  Hamburgers Kimmy!! 

Hope to see you all again before the summer comes to an end...

Chris First time here with my friend. Terrific, patient friendly service. Melissa, Kim and Sue-Ann were wonderful. Beautiful grounds. Only came for the day and didn't get to see everything. Spent time by the pool, then had some lunch. Best Reuben sandwich I've had anywhere. Craft beer was terrific and reasonably priced. Layed by the lake the rest of the afternoon. So relaxed I was legless getting off my lounger. We are coming back for sure. Only recomendation is to have pet friendly advertised more prominently. See you soon! Awesome place, awesome people. Not 1 bit disappointed with our time spent there (except for the weather, haha). Very welcoming by all the staff, Kim in the Bistro and Stephane himself.

The location is absolutely beautiful with the lake views. Unfortunately there was a fire ban on the island during our stay so we couldn't have any wood fires at night. The site we had was a little tight for our camper to get in and out of, but we made due. Overall it was a great time. Would recommend. We stayed for two nights in our Class C trailer. The park is a nice campground. Treed lots and not on top of each other :)! Staff are approachable, and willing to help with your questions. We really enjoyed having electrical, water and sewage dump. Quiet policy is effective. Loved it. Thank you for having us!! I would give this place 10 stars if I could. We haven’t experienced customer service like this before. When we arrived to our campsite we were a little bummed, the site didn’t have much privacy, we were in the front area where the trailers are. Andre came by right when we got there to ask us how we were, we mentioned the lack of privacy and he said no problem, he found us a place that was completely private. it was up this hill and we absolutely the loved it! Looks like they had a stage there to do shows or something. We liked the fact that we were close to people but not so close at the same time. The beach was medium sized, the water was ice cold but it was so hot that didn’t even matter. We had our boat with us and it was nice to dock it for the weekend so we didn’t have to keep it on our site. This place is great for families with children. They do enforce quiet time at 11pm which wasn’t a problem for us but if you are looking for a party camping weekend look else where. 

The showers and toilets were cleaned on the regular and looked newly renovated. the only thing that might deter someone would be the lack of hot water in the showers ( just get there super early to ensure you can shower before everyone) and possibly the size of the showers. I’m average size/height and found it somewhat difficult to wash. But I mean your camping so just take your two min shower in the morning and head out to enjoy the rest of your day. Still get 5 stars!

We would definitely come back, next time with the kiddos! Full hook ups, nice beach, convenient store, nice and quiet, friendly staff. Some nice sites on the beach. Our site was a bit overly shaded for my liking. We had to go to the beach to enjoy the sun. The sewer hook up wasn't that great but other than that we had a great time. Hardly any bugs. Stayed 2 nights in this campground and has no complaint. It is very quiet and clean, everything is organized. Will recommend for family. We got spot 142 and it is near the shore but just watch out for those mosquitoes if you’re in 141 or 142 better cook and eat early than usual because during dusk they start to feed their need for blood LOL.","Discover family camping at its best on Manitoulin Island.

Owners are wonderful people and Bruce really goes above and beyond to make Halloween memorable for the kids. Very happy we found our summer home here. The park is nice. The trailers are close together. The speed limit is 5km/hr. The lake is mucky on the bottom. Great place to spend time in nature. Excellent staff and facilities.  Wonderful family environment."

Dennis & Stephanie told us about their vision the first year we stayed & this year a lot of it is coming to fruition. The park is totally family oriented now & the vibe throughout the entire park is positive & peaceful. They are always available & willing to help. They are also great with our children! I can definitely see us returning for years to come 🙂. Rented one of the cabins for a weekend and really enjoyed our stay. The campground is peaceful and feels very private. The cabin was clean and comfortable, with a nice sized deck to sit out. It was bigger than we expected from the website photos. The lot was well shaded and had a good sized picnic table.It was close to the washrooms, pool and other amenities. There were three windows to allow natural light, but removable blackout curtains ensured everyone slept well and the cabin stayed dark until we were ready to wake up. The mattresses were very comfortable. Stephanie and Dennis were welcoming and helpful while we were there. The kids enjoyed the movie night, with free popcorn. They were sad to leave and we will be happy to come back. My family has been camping at Blue Sky RV for 3 years now. It was the first campground we took our new trailer to & this year we got a site for the season. The owners are friendly & helpful. Our kids love swimming in the pool & are in it from dawn until dusk some days. The resort is peaceful & family oriented  & there are always fun activities for our kids every weekend. We love this campground & intend to spend as much time here as we can. Dennis & Stephanie have turned this place around in the last 3 years & continue to upgrade the park every week. I would highly recommend a site here.","Escape to your camping retreat close to the city. Our beautiful forested campground offers relaxation, fun and amazing sunsets.

A beautiful Oasis for our family with beautiful tree's all around. It was a beautiful family campground. We were so impressed we did not hesitate to book our seasonal site. Great rates and great atmosphere!!

The camp manager was very professional and extremely polite. The office staff was amazing too.  They were very informal with every question I had in regards to the camp site.

We were able to get wood when we needed it and didn’t have to struggle to get any.My camping experience was amazing and I can’t wait to go back. Based on our expectations it was a disappointment. We thought it would be something like a koa or park campground-natural, filled with families on vacation, lots of green space and trees. Really it was just a shanty town filled with people living out of their RVs. They had them crammed in as tight as possible and many of them had built decks, sheds, etc on their tiny RV site.

Treed sites on Richard Lake. Family camping, paddleboats, recreation hall, store, 5 min to shopping, medical facilities and golf course. Sewer hookup at each site. Laundry facilities, security gates and cameras. Free WiFi and manager onsite 24/7. We have a new state-of-the-art environmentally friendly peat moss septic system. We have also installed a new water system. We are pet-friendly and have a recreation area for the kids, including a basketball and volleyball area. I Stayed at carols camp site last summer and I can’t express enough how great the experience I had there. The camp manager was very professional and extremely polite. The office staff was amazing too.  They were very informal with every question I had in regards to the camp site. They were welcoming and made my camping experience a good one. The bathrooms were well taken care of and very clean. We were able to get wood when we needed it and didn’t have to struggle to get any.My camping experience was amazing and I can’t wait to go back. Based on our expectations it was a disappointment. We thought it would be something like a koa or park campground-natural, filled with families on vacation, lots of green space and trees. Really it was just a shanty town filled with people living out of their RVs. They had them crammed in as tight as possible and many of them had built decks, sheds, etc on their tiny RV site.

The park was a wonderful place to retreat to. A year ago it was bought and the park has changed completely. No more laughing and fun.

 so I definitely wouldn't allow children to ride around on their bikes free now because you never know who might be there
Is also doubled the rent and that's all he cares about UPDATE May 9/18: New owner has totally destroyed what was once a beautiful park with trees and some wildlife.

I gave 1 star because ""0"" not an option. After 42 wonderful years in this park it has gone to the dogs after new owners took over in 2017. So much so that after we purchased a 2017 41' Quailridge mobile home (sleeping in it for a few weeks) we made the tough decision to pack it in. The new owner was a nightmare to deal with, gave everyone different information creating mass confusion, would out and out lie, has a mouth like a trucker and zero people skills. The park is in total disarray while he works on upgrades. He is very happy to have many, many long standing campers leave the park. To a few that decided to stay, he gave them 30 days to relocate their trailer, decks, sheds to another lot in the park at their expense. Needless to say those campers have decided not to stay now.

You will notice that the reviews after the new management took over have gone down hill. So the 3.5 rating that it has now isn't accurate anymore. Its more like a 1 now, and like a review from another camper states its only cause I couldnt give it a zero!!! Transient camper there for a couple of nights. Site access is extremely tight due to tree stumps and trees. When you book your site tell them your camper is much longer then it actually is, otherwise they will put you in a site suited for tents. Electricity can’t be more then 10amps and the breakers are not located on the power pedestal. You have to call the front desk when you blow a breaker.  Seasonal campers there seem to be pretty friendly and I’m assuming there power must be more sufficient. My advice to anyone wanting to camp there short term and use all amenities of there camper, is to find another camp ground... The people at the park are fantastic but the management is terrible.  The park manager is very rude.  I have been camping here for over 10 years and have many wonderful memories.  This year when I showed up to the park and seen how the Manager speaks to people around the park I was disgusted.  I was at the park for the long weekend and rented a site for 4 days and I ended leaving a day early because my family and I were not enjoying our stay. My family camps here at least one weekend a year. Clean park, beautiful setting. Omg stay away!!!! We arrived excited for a 4 day getaway booked way back in may. Upon check in we are told that whoever took our reservations mistakenly booked us into tent sites and they had no room for ourselves or our friends trailers.  Very rude and unprofessional, didnt apologize for the mistake or offer any reconciliation. Had to fight for our refund!!!

Its more like a 1 now, and like a review from another camper states its only cause I couldnt give it a zero!!! Transient camper there for a couple of nights. Site access is extremely tight due to tree stumps and trees. When you book your site tell them your camper is much longer then it actually is, otherwise they will put you in a site suited for tents. Electricity can’t be more then 10amps and the breakers are not located on the power pedestal. You have to call the front desk when you blow a breaker.  Seasonal campers there seem to be pretty friendly and I’m assuming there power must be more sufficient. My advice to anyone wanting to camp there short term and use all amenities of there camper, is to find another camp ground... The people at the park are fantastic but the management is terrible.  The park manager is very rude.  I have been camping here for over 10 years and have many wonderful memories.  This year when I showed up to the park and seen how the Manager speaks to people around the park I was disgusted.  I was at the park for the long weekend and rented a site for 4 days and I ended leaving a day early because my family and I were not enjoying our stay. My family camps here at least one weekend a year. Clean park, beautiful setting. Omg stay away!!!! We arrived excited for a 4 day getaway booked way back in may. Upon check in we are told that whoever took our reservations mistakenly booked us into tent sites and they had no room for ourselves or our friends trailers.  Very rude and unprofessional, didnt apologize for the mistake or offer any reconciliation. Had to fight for our refund!!! The reviews are so accurate about management being ignorant!!!"

""The County"") in the area known as Hillier Ward, the heart of the southeastern Ontario wine industry.Originally opened as a fishing camp over 40 years ago, East Shore Campark has evolved and expanded to become a great getaway for everyone. Consecon Lake's diverse habitats are known for excellent fishing, hosting sport fish such as rock bass, walleye, and northern pike, as well as yellow perch, bluegills and other ""fun fishing"" species. Along with our boat launch and docking facilities, we offer a fish hut with facilities for cleaning and disposing of fish wastes.The campground is ideally located to give easy access to area amenities and the county's events and activities, but provides excellent privacy, peace and quiet.

Lots of fun for the kids. Life jackets are required for everyone (kids and adults) in the lake, but there were times when kids slip out of view and you panic that you can't see them in the lake. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone with small kids as the big kids do take over. Good outing for the family! I loved all the inflatables they looked very fun, and it is nice how there is a waterslide too. The menu prices are very reasonable and you can bring in your own food so that is awesome! I did not like how people who weren't going to go on the inflatables (parents) had to pay the full price, it would be nice if there was a option where you can pay for a wristband to go on the inflatables, and then pay separately to use the bathrooms, beach, etc. The beach wasn't the best. Overall, it is a nice outing, but to get the best value I suggest that anyone who is going will be using the inflatables. Very friendly staff. Very clean and well maintained. Love the variety of water activities availability for the children. Feel very safe with all the lifeguards present. Food at the pavillion is delicious.  Thanks for making our families visits through the summer so memorable. This place was awesome. Kids loved it. Lots of floats to climb. Packed and a bit overpriced for a daily visit. It's a big camp with a small lake (ex quarry) that is packed with families in the summer. Probably good for families with kids, but if you are looking for a relaxing day at the beach you should look elsewhere. We paid $20 admission, spent almost an hour looking for a place to park, half an hour to find a spot we can somewhat relaxed at, took one dip in the small but very deep lake and that was it. It may have been worth it if it was free...","Emerald Lake is a stunning RV and camping destination that is also great for day trips.

This is our first season at Goreskis. We looked at a #of parks before choosing this one. This one had the highest fees so we were expecting the service to match that, but unfortunately it doesn't. 
The pros:
Lots of amenities (pools, mini golf, etc.)
Close to the city
Family friendly- kids everywhere
Boat rental available 
The cons:
Major problems with loosing power. Most long weekends we pack up and go home.
Limited events and very little for adults or families (Would love to see outdoor yoga, movie nights etc).
Service from staff is average. Many questions are answered with ""I don't know"". The friendliest person here is the summer student  Jenna. 
Communication is terrible. If events are cancelled, you are not informed.  Events on the schedule are often ""a mistake"" and don't take place or are rescheduled. The ""Events"" board is not updated and facebook page is rarely used.
Fees are higher than similar parks.

Large or small group the campground has everything we need, as well as a great dog beach for our 2 pups! Highly recommended campground for a relaxing outdoor get-a-way! We have the beach to ourselves! Anyone we see is very friendly and welcoming. Campground is very clean. Our Boston Terrier had fun playing in the water as well.
Main bathroom was clean, showers where fine, soap was full, hand dryers work, sinks are low flow. There are porta-potties/polly johns around. 
Every site has a picnic table, ours has two table tops. Fire Ban is still on which sucks but they cant control that. Blue bins are for recycle, bring clear bags for garbage. 
We rented a 14 foot boat went fishing and toured the lake. 
Playground has lots too offer, volleyball net, 
basket ball and horseshoe pits. 
Long weekends may differ from during the week we are having a fabulous time and will return! Had a group of over 100 people there and it was awesome. The washrooms are clean and well maintained. Service was excellent.  grounds well kept and beach very clean and pet friendly. Will continue to visit. We have been here almost every year since 2004. The rules have never changed. Basic respect of the woods and neighbours is really the whole thing. As young people we were allowed to party back on ""rowdy ridge"". As more subdued adults we choose to stay in a more quiet area. Staff is awesome and all facilities are clean. I see a lot of complaints about rules but the same rules are what keep the park in such good condition. It's a beautiful place and fun is encouraged. Booked late, only a week before the labour day long weekend and was lucky enough to get a site with water and hydro. 
Read a few of the negative reviews and was a little concerned  - I needn't have worried.  Sheila, greeted us by name, gave us clear instructions on what was expected of us on our stay and what facilities were available.  
Nothing unreasonable at all.
The site was an easy pull through with plenty of space, a new bench table, in-ground firepit and a recycle bin on each site.. 
The hydro sites are quite close together so if you want a little more privacy maybe book one of the backcountry unserviced sites towards the beach.... which is lovely, shallow enough to make it a great place for kids to swim and play and deep enough for adults further out. 
And speaking of kids. They have a playground, tennis, basketball and volleyball areas as well as a sand pit for the kids close to the campsites. 

The washrooms are basic, campground fare, concrete floors and cold water only on the sinks. When I mentioned to Sheila on our first morning that the hot water had run out by the time I was ready to shower, she immediately sent someone to turn on the second water heater. Never a shortage again! 

Jim pointed us in the direction of a couple of places in the area not to be missed. Burks falls and Screaming Heads. Well worth the visit.

River on one side and a lake, for swimming and kayaking, canoeing, fishing. 
And they are expanding to include more serviced sites next year.
Would definitely recommend to anyone who appreciates a little of the comfort of home in a tranquil treed setting. 

Many of the campers had dogs, which were generally well behaved and quiet. They even include a section of the beach just for dogs.","Located on the doorstep of Algonquin Park. 175 acres on Himbury Lake and the Magnetawan River. Beautiful crystal-clear sandy beach with a pet-friendly area. Great canoeing on the Magnetawan River or fishing in a spring-fed lake for bass, pike and pickerel. Bordering 5,000 acres of crown land. We have a good number of amenities to make your stay comfortable and relaxing, including free hot showers. ATV trails are across the road, part of the Algonquin west ATV club. Sites for 2 people to 100 people, tenting area, group tenting area and large pull-thru sites, ranging from unserviced, E/W, E/W/S, park-like settings, open areas, and beachfront tent camping to small private treed sites. We cater to families, small and large groups, tents to large trailers and RVs. Book your site by the day, weekend or week; we do not have any seasonal sites. We have beach volleyball, horseshoes, a sports field, basketball, trails, watercraft rental and a great sandy swimming area. See you soon at Granite Ri We love staying here, we have been camping here for 13 years now and every time has been great. Large or small group the campground has everything we need, as well as a great dog beach for our 2 pups! Highly recommended campground for a relaxing outdoor get-a-way! We have the beach to ourselves! Anyone we see is very friendly and welcoming. Campground is very clean. Our Boston Terrier had fun playing in the water as well.
Main bathroom was clean, showers where fine, soap was full, hand dryers work, sinks are low flow. There are porta-potties/polly johns around. 
Every site has a picnic table, ours has two table tops. Fire Ban is still on which sucks but they cant control that. Blue bins are for recycle, bring clear bags for garbage. 
We rented a 14 foot boat went fishing and toured the lake. 
Playground has lots too offer, volleyball net, 
basket ball and horseshoe pits. 
Long weekends may differ from during the week we are having a fabulous time and will return! Had a group of over 100 people there and it was awesome. The washrooms are clean and well maintained. Service was excellent.  grounds well kept and beach very clean and pet friendly. Will continue to visit. We have been here almost every year since 2004. The rules have never changed. Basic respect of the woods and neighbours is really the whole thing. As young people we were allowed to party back on ""rowdy ridge"". As more subdued adults we choose to stay in a more quiet area. Staff is awesome and all facilities are clean. I see a lot of complaints about rules but the same rules are what keep the park in such good condition. It's a beautiful place and fun is encouraged. Booked late, only a week before the labour day long weekend and was lucky enough to get a site with water and hydro.

There's lots of people who have year round trailers here.  This place is also great for short stays.

The cabins have hydro (plug, outside light, inside light with fan) in the cabins. The water from the outside taps is potable and every site has a fire pit (from what I saw).  There are angled sites for trailers/RVs as well as small sites for tents.  The front desk staff are friendly and the store has many items you'd need for camping, they also sell wood and ice.  There's a barn where events happen with laundry and an arcade on the lower level. You can also rent little peddle 4 wheel karts to tour around the area.

The public showers and bathrooms were super clean. The staff was amazing and so welcoming! We will be returning next summer. Thank you for making our stay a good one! Truly a place to be with children. Just played nine holes of golf at the campground. Pleasant afternoon. Toilets are well maintained and camp is quiet. Site doesn't have privacy but good size.

We also took in the drive-in theatre just down the road. Bring some screen door screen to cover your windows if its hot and humid at night. Then you can keep your windows open and keep the bugs out. We saw 2 movies - 2 adults/2 teens - cost $40. There is so much to see and do around the area. This place is a definite return location. Great place to setup base camp for adventures. Great park.

There is a lot of mud when it rains because a lack of grass due to the trees blocking a lot of the sun out. They do lock the gates between 9pm-9am but they do offer a access card for those who need to get in after hours. Overall very happy with the experience. CLEAN, and very comfortable. Loved it. Plenty of things to do with the kids. Petting zoo, soccer, volley ball net, horseshoe pits, play ground, hiking trails, fishing, canoes and paddle boats to rent and a nice size pool. Quiet after 11pm. We had absolutely no mosquitoes. Will be back up again.

Wouldn't advise for anyone with children or living full time in RVs. Has lied about refunds or costs. Debatably not family friendly. This is in reply to the reviewer that posted 2 days ago about her experience at this park. I cannot comment on whatever conversation took place between you and the owner. However, I can comment on our opinion of you as a neighbour. You had 3 children and 2 large dogs with you in a small travel trailer, my guess is it was under 25 feet in length. I never saw your children out but I heard them, you and your dogs constantly. Your doors were being slammed every few minutes. So much so that several of your neighbours complained to the owner about the noise. I was unable to relax and watch TV in the evening because of this banging. How you have a usable trailer left bewilders me as it took such abuse from you the occupants. As regards refunds again I cannot comment other than to say we paid over a thousand dollars for the month. As a monthly rate is generally discounted and it is common practice for a company to charge more for weekly rates, rebates should therefore reflect this pricing. We are full time RV""ers and will head south to warmer climates in a few days, thankfully for us we have been able to relax in our home since you and your noise left. Green acres is a beautiful camp ground with excellent clean facilities, superior to many others in the area and it deserves credit not condemnation for trying to maintain this standard. The owner had no choice but to confront you after the complaints he received. Great place to camp for families with kids. Had an amazing pull through site with lots of room. The pool and hot tubs were very clean and maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. The kids loved fishing in the pond and playing in the large playground. Overall a great week of camping. I would highly recommend camping here. This is a great place for longer term campers. The park is immaculate and it is nice and quiet. Lots of weekly activities and events.

This is NOT a family campground, it’s an old age home. I love older people, but there are a lot of complainers that want it to be completely silent. I have 5 boys and we booked our yearly family camping trip around this week and I deeply regret it. We were told our kids were to loud and need to use their “inside voices” outside during the day. There was two empty lots around us but we were told the kids were not allowed to run through them. Then another guest told us the owners were spying on us and admittedly told other campers that that’s what they were doing to get evidence of the kids talking loudly. Then they would circle our site with their golf cart giving us accusative stares. I have never been to a place that made us feel like we didn’t belong or didn’t know how to care for our own kids. This wasn’t just the owners fault, it’s also the type of campers that camp here. I have no idea why or how some people don’t enjoy watching kids laugh and play? Because this is what my boys were doing. We are sad we wasted our week here... we won’t be back. Nice park...given a site not at all private when we specified private please...it was like they chose the least private in whole park just for us I read the campground website thoroughly and, as far as I can see, a piece of important information is apparently missing. Although I have read mixed reviews concerning the management of the campground (including that the adverse side of the park managers appear to lean more towards micro-managing according to some of the above reviews), I will say that the website can be misleading to prospective campers who have RV’s. I approached the park manager last summer and said that my wife and I are interested in purchasing a seasonal site for the next year. The lady ask me how old my RV was and upon learning that my unit was just over 10 years  old (it was 11 years old at the time) she refused to accept my application, clearly stating that RV’s older than 10 years are not accepted in the park. 

Although the policy is in my opinion somewhat discriminatory I probably cannot argue that the management can exercise that particular right to refuse units based on age. However, that they do not mentioned this restriction on their website when they advertise and promote all their so called wonderful attributes of their campground can mislead customers wanting to purchase stayovers. So I ask that this message be shared to readers as a warning to travelers. If your RV is more than 10 years old don’t waste your time approaching this campground. Beautiful place, friendly staff.

I have 5 boys and we booked our yearly family camping trip around this week and I deeply regret it. We were told our kids were to loud and need to use their “inside voices” outside during the day. There was two empty lots around us but we were told the kids were not allowed to run through them. Then another guest told us the owners were spying on us and admittedly told other campers that that’s what they were doing to get evidence of the kids talking loudly. Then they would circle our site with their golf cart giving us accusative stares. I have never been to a place that made us feel like we didn’t belong or didn’t know how to care for our own kids. This wasn’t just the owners fault, it’s also the type of campers that camp here. I have no idea why or how some people don’t enjoy watching kids laugh and play? Because this is what my boys were doing. We are sad we wasted our week here... we won’t be back. Nice park...given a site not at all private when we specified private please...it was like they chose the least private in whole park just for us I read the campground website thoroughly and, as far as I can see, a piece of important information is apparently missing. Although I have read mixed reviews concerning the management of the campground (including that the adverse side of the park managers appear to lean more towards micro-managing according to some of the above reviews), I will say that the website can be misleading to prospective campers who have RV’s. I approached the park manager last summer and said that my wife and I are interested in purchasing a seasonal site for the next year. The lady ask me how old my RV was and upon learning that my unit was just over 10 years  old (it was 11 years old at the time) she refused to accept my application, clearly stating that RV’s older than 10 years are not accepted in the park. 

Although the policy is in my opinion somewhat discriminatory I probably cannot argue that the management can exercise that particular right to refuse units based on age. However, that they do not mentioned this restriction on their website when they advertise and promote all their so called wonderful attributes of their campground can mislead customers wanting to purchase stayovers. So I ask that this message be shared to readers as a warning to travelers. If your RV is more than 10 years old don’t waste your time approaching this campground. Beautiful place, friendly staff. Super clean washrooms! Close to the beach. Only downside: Our tent site didn't have privacy"

A good choice of you're looking to relax and appreciate the outdoors I grew up coming to gullivers and in the past year or so it has truly gone down hill. The grounds have not been kept up as well as usual but even more so the staff are so very RUDE! The front gate staff are never smiling, I always see them yelling at guests and it doesn’t seem like they ever try to keep good relations with the patrons in the park. Very upsetting. The lake is beautiful with really nice water but this year I have been shocked at how rude the new management staff are.  It’s like they hate their job and they treat guests like a nuisance rather than valued customers. If you have to interact with the staff they ruin the experience. Excellent camp grounds, clean friendly staff Good place to spend afternoon by the pond and trailer park too","Welcome to Gulliver’s Lake Park, a seasonal vacation park in peaceful wooded surroundings.

She handed our daughter spray cleaner and told her to clean it, without ever checking the bathroom before or after the punishment was enforeced. To top it off when we went to use the restrooms that night they were trashed garbage overflowing, toilets not flushed...

Bugsy loves that too... the pools are a nice way to cool off, keep up the great work! Nice campground . Unfortunately the group sites we were given were directly on the roadway which was extremely loud. Price is fairly high too but there is many activities on site you can do which offsets the price First time here and it was fairly nice. Washrooms were clean as far as campground standards. The beach is small but lovely. There is another small area of beach for dogs and where you can launch your canoe/kayak etc. We were next to a pool which was awesome on this very hot weekend. I was a bit surprised at how many people didn’t clean up after their dogs though. Come on people, show some respect for your fellow campers. Booked 2 nights here but can say it was absolutely a waste of money, time, gas and breath. You can't judge a place by how nice it looks. The real impression comes from the people whom are hired to make our family getaway not only memorable but enjoyable. We booked 3 campsites on phase 1 beside the office. Those washrooms were disgusting and full of cob webs and bugs. Toilets were so gross it would have been better to squat by a tree and use leaves to wipe since there was no paper in the stall. Luckily we   carry wipes since we came with babies.
I went to office just to let them know to send someone to check those washrooms and the guy just looked at me and smirked and said ""next time try the ones beside the beach"".  I was so embarrassed and upset that I couldn't believe that a staff member would respond that way. Seems like other campers have been experiencing horrible things also. They must have a bunch of family give them good reviews because after this experience I can't see anyone enjoying their time here. Absolutely never coming back. Nolan Vallery should NOT be an owner. He is a terrible person to the campers and staff. Only person to go 50km through the park when the speed limit is 10km. Campers have been getting kicked out of the park for speeding, what do you expect when you see the owner speeding on through?
Plus, the prices are ridiculous compared to other well-owned campgrounds.
I hope this review helps. You can do better...","The fun begins at Highland Pines, a highly sought-after vacation destination on beautiful Lake Belwood.

Sites are overlooking a magnificent 5-acre pond. Airsoft games field. its really nice to just have fun and enjoy the summer! Bugsy loves it, his favorite part is a golfcart ride! he loves it! especially when there are stars out, and i love the cool air when your driving around. and the dog beach! Bugsy loves that too... the pools are a nice way to cool off, keep up the great work! Nice campground . Unfortunately the group sites we were given were directly on the roadway which was extremely loud. Price is fairly high too but there is many activities on site you can do which offsets the price First time here and it was fairly nice. Washrooms were clean as far as campground standards. The beach is small but lovely. There is another small area of beach for dogs and where you can launch your canoe/kayak etc. We were next to a pool which was awesome on this very hot weekend. I was a bit surprised at how many people didn’t clean up after their dogs though. Come on people, show some respect for your fellow campers. Booked 2 nights here but can say it was absolutely a waste of money, time, gas and breath. You can't judge a place by how nice it looks. The real impression comes from the people whom are hired to make our family getaway not only memorable but enjoyable. We booked 3 campsites on phase 1 beside the office. Those washrooms were disgusting and full of cob webs and bugs. Toilets were so gross it would have been better to squat by a tree and use leaves to wipe since there was no paper in the stall. Luckily we   carry wipes since we came with babies.
I went to office just to let them know to send someone to check those washrooms and the guy just looked at me and smirked and said ""next time try the ones beside the beach"".  I was so embarrassed and upset that I couldn't believe that a staff member would respond that way. Seems like other campers have been experiencing horrible things also. They must have a bunch of family give them good reviews because after this experience I can't see anyone enjoying their time here. Absolutely never coming back. Nolan Vallery should NOT be an owner. He is a terrible person to the campers and staff. Only person to go 50km through the park when the speed limit is 10km. Campers have been getting kicked out of the park for speeding, what do you expect when you see the owner speeding on through?
Plus, the prices are ridiculous compared to other well-owned campgrounds.
I hope this review helps. You can do better..."

I would recommend to take own food. Prices there are from Space...and food is not good at all. We had fries sausages and ribs. In Indoor area. A cool place, though they are very strict on size restrictions.
The park is rather small. One day is more than enough.
There was a so called Halloween parade. That was simply a bad joke! Good place to spend some time with a kid. For kids of 5-14 years it is a good place for sure. Although the visit might get somewhat expensive: paid parking, expensive food, tricky games where sometimes the item you would win cost more than the attempt to earn it. If you do not want to spoil the day I would not offer to play those games. Very lovely designed park. Tickets are quite expensive but you get really nice ambient and well made attractions. If you bring your own food and drinks you can save lots of money. I can only recommend it. Amazing roller coasters and atmosphere. Always sooo many people though, the wait line is infinite for every roller coaster.","Beautiful treed family resort with camping and seasonal sites, as well as rental trailers.

Bingo adult games like golf cart rodeo. mini golf event. and more and kids have almost something every week to do and dances and many sports u can play... the best thing is there is 3 pools and splash pad.. everyone one is friendly great place to get away We went for 4 nights from September 20th to the 24th. We wanted a place that the pool was still opened, and they delivered. We had a great stay at a beautiful park, and a beautiful area of Ontario that we had not camped before. We will he returning next year if at all possible. Kids love visiting in the summer. Staff great..everyone so friendly..great events..pools clean. We try to go every summer. Location is great and so many options that are within 10 minute driving distance..tim hortons, no frills, beautiful beaches, the strip etc. My family’s got a trailer here & overall it’s a really great place. You get what you pay for, there’s lower priced to higher price range trailers all in the same park so there’s a spot for everyone. There’s also a great pool setup with an adults only section, which I really like. The reason for the 4 stars then? Honestly, the other residents make the experience worse. A lot of the residents are SUPER cliquey, it basically feels like high school again. If you don’t get in with their group, you won’t have a very nice time at the trailer park.","5 km S of Grand Bend on Highway 21. Family camping. 3 heated pools, Splashpad Zone, 2 playgrounds, organized activities for children and adults, variety store, snack booth, basketball court, beach volleyball court, horseshoe pits and much more! A proud member of the Linwood Parks family. We are serious shoppers for the right trailer and the right park for us. The girls at the office were so friendly and helpful....thank you!  This is our park the one we are in love with. The amenities and the environment are perfect!

Easy check in, friendly faces when we interacted with staff and very nice place to stay. Many items / activities for the kids to play with and keep entertained.  There is a beach access across the street that was very private, water was cold and a bit rocky but great little spot.  Bathrooms are clean and showers were hot!  The only opportunity is to have the trees grow for some shade in the overnight stay, but time will fix that! We loved it.  The campground is clean and the staff are friendly.  We were fortunate to be tenting.  The tent spots are more spacious than most of the seasonal spots.  We also loved that the tent sites were in a valley and away from traffic noise. We go here every year and camp in the valley. The site is conveniently located across the road from a public park along Lake Huron. A great time for all ages. Family oriented friendly campground with lots to do for young and old! Dont miss out on this amazing Christian campground experience! Something for everyone and then some! Highly recommend!"

-No Wire Grill Grate: Most campsites I go to have this. In the end I had to pay $18 for theirs just so I could cook. 
-Paid showers: for the price I feel showers should be included Clean, family camping area. Incredibly well maintained. The staff were alwats really helpful with directions or suggestions.

Will be booking annually from now on as this was the type of campground we were looking for in the Muskokas with no such luck.  Land's End is where it's at. Camp ground is clean and staff are mostly friendly. Nice park for kids. Cute frog and turtle pond. Beach is a little small but overall not bad. This was a nice place to spend a few nights camping. No complaints at all. And when our campsite was flooded they moved us to another site. We will go back for sure.","Come relax with us at this beautiful, clean, quiet campground situated in 70 acres of natural forest in Tobermory, at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula.

Came back this year (currently still here) and see such amazing improvements. It's great to see a campground with so much focus on improving this for everyone and there is so much focus and events for the kids. The foam party was awesome. This will definitely be a regular camping spot for us. Roy and staff made us feel welcome! Outstanding amenities,clean pools and facilities with lots to do for every member of the family.

Lots of work being done to fix past issues and pave the way for a fantastic destination the whole family will enjoy.  Thanks Roy and staff.  Keep up the great work.  See you next year! Our family experience was perfect.

Super clean and quiet campground. 
Kids could run all around in full safety.
The interior and exterior pools were top quality and the playground was great.

The owner puts a lot of pride in making the kids happy. During our short stay, he had a truck load of sand delivered to the playground just for fun. That made the kid's day and brought everyone together.

We recommend it highly and will be back. We have recently stayed at the Marmora KOA for Thanksgiving with a very large group (9 families).. The kids loved all of the activities that were planned, Bingo was great, the potluck dinner was delicious & we had a blast! Thanks for a great weekend Roy!","UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP.

We booked a site with them for two nights as we had a wedding in the area.

Our stay was on the tailend of a week of camping in a pop up tent trailer and we were tired. We had a three year old and a nine month old in tow.

There were no issues getting our site and organized. 

It’s evident that it’s a community with people that stay the entire season with them year over year. Everyone is friendly.

We didn’t have any firewood and got such a cold snap the two nights we were there. The first night people told us where their own wood was and to help ourselves. The second night residents came buy each sharing some of their wood and leaving it by our fire.

I can’t say enough nice things about this place and would gladly visit again.

Thank you Wendy, Kelly and Natalie (and residents) for welcoming some weary campers for a few nights. Had a wonderful stay at this park.  Sites are large, clean pool and friendly family staff.  Seasonal campers were great, made some new friends.  Close to amenities in Carleton Place, as well as Ottawa area.  Would recommend this park to anyone.  Lake is great for fishing as well.  This park will be an annual trip for our family.  Thanks for the stay Wendy, Victoria and Victor. A real seasonal RV community, small and well-run. Emphasize ""community"" - both by efforts of the owner & family and of the residents. After your first week you'll have friends all over the park, or you can stay private if you like. There are the normal rules for a seasonal park, and they are enforced consistently. They work, efforts are made to let people enjoy their site as they want, and the owner is up front about them.  The same applies for any extra fees. Location and water access can't be beat, lots are large for the most part. It has campers of all ages, and activities to boot. Many residents have docked boats. Nice place to camp. pretty grounds, nice pool for the kids and a pleasant little park. Pretty quiet there too so enjoy the peace and quiet! We have been camping here since 2011. They have the largest lots we have ever seen at any other camp site. It is close to all amenities, we are 5 minutes away from Carleton Place, 15 minutes from Almonte. The camp is very family oriented, lots of activities for both children and adults. Including annual golf tournament, with live entertainment, as well as very popular clean pool. Staff is very friendly and always accommodating, but also will put there foot down when needed, help to keep the riffraff away. Being a seasonal camper I would not want it any other way, this campsite is well taken care, bathrooms are always clean and grass is always cut. Very fun and safe place to bring children and grand children when they come to visit us! We are very happy here and will be staying for as long as we are able to camp!

Had voltage issues 30Amp only, water pressure issues. Very open space. No seclusion. Garbage pick up and recycling. Washer and dryer, library room, pool. Good price compared to other RV parks. Just pulled out of the park.
Overall it gets a 3 from me.  We use a tent trailer so rely on the parks washroom, which was in really rough shape.  Very low water pressure and showers went boiling to ice cold, showers themselves are rickety at best, and the toilets were rocking back and forth.

Seems all the infrastructure is in need of serious work.

It was a clean park.  Owners maintain the outside - the lots are large.  Lots of trees.  We enjoyed those elements.

If the washrooms were in better shape in would upgrade rating to 4. Large spots and nice pool. Bathroom/shower area are horrendous and need a serious update, owners are not friendly and not welcoming at all. We had a very pleasant stay here, the location is great, very central for exploring the area and with the unique ability to dock a boat. The owners are very attentive and are great to work with! In our case we were towing a boat and needed launch / retrieve service and that was done without any issues at all. The only real negative for us is that some of the seasonal sites are a bit rundown and showing their age which takes away from the overall feel of the park but not a deal breaker for us at all. A park spruce up would take my rating to 5 stars. The boat docks are about a 3-4 minute hike away from the park area and you must cross a road that can be busy at times but to find an RV Park in Muskoka with any docking at all is rare so that's a big plus in this park's favour in my estimation. We will definitely be back, there is tons to do in this area!  Delightful park in Muskoka!  Close to a sandy public beach for swimming and kayaking in Lake Muskoka. Close to Bracebridge and Port Carling for shopping. Clean, quiet and friendly RV park right in the heart of it all!  This is great value for this area. We will be coming back.","Muskoka Ridge Trailer Park is located in one of the most beautiful vacation destinations in the world. Whether you are looking for a seasonal retreat or a weekend of family camping, we have the perfect spot for you.We have 100 full-service sites with town water/sewer and 30-amp power and free WiFi at your site.Our campers can enjoy a swim in our pool on a hot day, or take the kids to our playground, where we have many fun activities. We offer our campers special events such as corn roasts, kids' day, barbecues, and golf tournaments.We are located near the historic town of Bracebridge on the Muskoka River, which leads into magnificent Lake Muskoka. Water-skiers can take advantage of nearby Allport Bay, while fishermen seek out the next big catch on Lake Muskoka. Santa's Village is just across the river. Kirby's Beach is a great place to take your family for a swim, while Strawberry Point Trail leads you to a breathtaking view of Lake Muskoka.See you soon! George and Marilyn Great Park, friendly people and owners. Had voltage issues 30Amp only, water pressure issues. Very open space. No seclusion. Garbage pick up and recycling. Washer and dryer, library room, pool. Good price compared to other RV parks. Just pulled out of the park.
Overall it gets a 3 from me.  We use a tent trailer so rely on the parks washroom, which was in really rough shape.  Very low water pressure and showers went boiling to ice cold, showers themselves are rickety at best, and the toilets were rocking back and forth.

Seems all the infrastructure is in need of serious work.

It was a clean park.  Owners maintain the outside - the lots are large.  Lots of trees.  We enjoyed those elements.

If the washrooms were in better shape in would upgrade rating to 4. Large spots and nice pool. Bathroom/shower area are horrendous and need a serious update, owners are not friendly and not welcoming at all. We had a very pleasant stay here, the location is great, very central for exploring the area and with the unique ability to dock a boat. The owners are very attentive and are great to work with! In our case we were towing a boat and needed launch / retrieve service and that was done without any issues at all.

My husband and I dropped off our daughter at her grandma’s campsite today and when we pulled in, we weren’t sure what to do as we hadn’t been there before. My mother in law who was camping said to go to the office. My husband went to the office for assistance, to which the man working there came out, “barked WHAT DO YOU WANT?” And then proceeded to angrily tell my husband he told him three times to drive to the gate and press the button. My husband said we’d just gotten there and the owner yelled that no, he told us three times. We drove up to the gate and pressed the button but the man didn’t let us in, even though we could see him looking at our car from the office. We called my mother in law who said she’d come meet us at the gate. The man then marched to our car and yelled at us to roll the window down. When we did, he again yelled that he told us three times to press the button. This time I said that we’d just gotten there and hadn’t talked to anyone. He then yelled at me, saying he talked to me first. I replied that no he hadn’t, again we’d just gotten there. He kept yelling, but finally stormed off to the gate to let us through. He shook his head at us angrily as we drove through. I’ve never been treated so poorly by an employee. Our young children were in the backseat and had to witness us being yelled at and it scared them. We weren’t even camping, just dropping our daughter off for a night camping with grandma. I would give zero stars if I could. I will never, ever in a million years go back here or even recommend this place. They should be ashamed at how they treat people. Spent a season at Nith River. It is mostly seasonal campers, but there are some nightly spots. We found the seasonal campers to be very helpful and friendly. This not a party park. The owners were always good to us and the park is very well kept and maintained. Only reason we left, was that we sold our trailer. Very clean and welcoming park.  We enjoyed our stay.

Previous reviewer must have had a bad day because we couldn't smell the pulp plant, the washers worked for us and there are  both water & electricity right on our campsite. This was absolutely the worst camping experience I have ever had, unfortunately the main issues that are the problem are ones the owner has little control of. The smell.. It is overwhelming ..the smell of the towns pulp mill. My issue is that the owner feels it is fine to charge $30 for a stinky campsite with no access to water. I also was frusterated that when the washer took our money, the owner was quite patronizing, suggesting we could not use a washing machine.
The fact is he is taking advantage of people at a part of the trans-canada hwy where there are not many options.

Management is very friendly and accommodating.  The pool is well kept and clean. I would give it a 5 if they had a public shower (one at pool doesn't qualify)  We are in an RV so don't really need it, but we like to use them sometimes for a change.  Otherwise, all great!!!!!! Very accommodating. We came for a weekend to trade our trailer a much bigger fifth wheel. Paul had no problem accommodating our size change, by putting us in the large pull through sites he had. We first visited at the end of September, and now, a week later, we are going back. Great place, especially if you have family to visit in the Hamilton area, which we do. We're from Ottawa. I wanted to love this place, after reading the reviews. But, I felt that this was a park which catered to seasonal residents and that those of us ""passing through"" were only tolerated. The RV sites would have been completely muddy if we had significant rain; fortunately it stayed mostly dry. 
Unfortunately, we had a problem with our water heater and had to rely on the showers provided by the park. We have travelled a fair bit over the last two years and have stayed in parks ranging basic to luxurious. The one constant was that shower areas were clean, even if a bit worn. 
Olympia has showers only at poolside, with toilets, sinks, etc. I don't recall seeing anything this depressing anywhere, anytime. Doors all open to the elements, leaves and debris blown in. Three colours of chipped, worn paint on the floor, bare concrete underneath. Plywood doors on the toilet stalls, everything looked grungy and depressing. I was so angry with myself that I'd forgotten to bring a pair of flip-flops with me. 
I have to say that I really appreciated the blue bins scattered around the site; makes it so much easier to keep to our regular recycling habits. And it was nice to see picnic tables and firepits, one of the perks of rural sites. 
Not sure what to say about staff, we shared our concern about the shower/washrooms with staff, who responded that ""our bathroom guy is kind of hit and miss"" and that our comment would be passed on. However, when we left, the owner's contact info was provided, and we were directed to share our opinions with him. 
All in all, I have to say that I would not return to this park. One visit was enough for me. Very quiet and relaxing. I'm just a visitor, and I wish I could afford a trailer someday. And yes of course I would recommend your campground to my friends.  See you again next summer. This is a very convenient camping area convenient to Toronto.  Office personnel we're very knowledgeable of the area and provided us with valuable information.  We were able to conveniently access the Lion Safari, gas station and stores from here.  Park was clean and peaceful, people were friendly and it was a good stopping place as we explored the area.","Hwy 403 to Hwy 6; north to Conc 4. Turn west and go 12 km.

My husband and I were here for a month in June and liked it so much, we came back for September.  Management is very friendly and accommodating.  The pool is well kept and clean. I would give it a 5 if they had a public shower (one at pool doesn't qualify)  We are in an RV so don't really need it, but we like to use them sometimes for a change.  Otherwise, all great!!!!!! Very accommodating. We came for a weekend to trade our trailer a much bigger fifth wheel. Paul had no problem accommodating our size change, by putting us in the large pull through sites he had. We first visited at the end of September, and now, a week later, we are going back. Great place, especially if you have family to visit in the Hamilton area, which we do. We're from Ottawa. I wanted to love this place, after reading the reviews. But, I felt that this was a park which catered to seasonal residents and that those of us ""passing through"" were only tolerated. The RV sites would have been completely muddy if we had significant rain; fortunately it stayed mostly dry. 
Unfortunately, we had a problem with our water heater and had to rely on the showers provided by the park. We have travelled a fair bit over the last two years and have stayed in parks ranging basic to luxurious. The one constant was that shower areas were clean, even if a bit worn. 
Olympia has showers only at poolside, with toilets, sinks, etc. I don't recall seeing anything this depressing anywhere, anytime. Doors all open to the elements, leaves and debris blown in. Three colours of chipped, worn paint on the floor, bare concrete underneath. Plywood doors on the toilet stalls, everything looked grungy and depressing. I was so angry with myself that I'd forgotten to bring a pair of flip-flops with me. 
I have to say that I really appreciated the blue bins scattered around the site; makes it so much easier to keep to our regular recycling habits. And it was nice to see picnic tables and firepits, one of the perks of rural sites. 
Not sure what to say about staff, we shared our concern about the shower/washrooms with staff, who responded that ""our bathroom guy is kind of hit and miss"" and that our comment would be passed on. However, when we left, the owner's contact info was provided, and we were directed to share our opinions with him. 
All in all, I have to say that I would not return to this park. One visit was enough for me. Very quiet and relaxing. I'm just a visitor, and I wish I could afford a trailer someday. And yes of course I would recommend your campground to my friends.  See you again next summer. This is a very convenient camping area convenient to Toronto.  Office personnel we're very knowledgeable of the area and provided us with valuable information.  We were able to conveniently access the Lion Safari, gas station and stores from here.  Park was clean and peaceful, people were friendly and it was a good stopping place as we explored the area."

Had issues with appliances 're:
The coffee maker never shuts off & leaks water! Big cleanup after making 1st pot. Had to put unit in sink. & full up. 2 additional cups. The stove gas holes in back burners had plugged holes which made for uneven cooking. When we were having a fire in our we could all smell the waste in our area which made it quite unpleasant to sit around fire.
I would recommend look @ appliances more closely as the coffee unit should be thrown out and replaced with new 1.  
The gas appliance should have annual maintenance & I don't know what you can do about the smell from waste pipe.
I almost forgot, the fridge freezer section fan motor has frozen so there was continuous noise throughout the entire stay. 
Would we come back? Yes, but to a different rental other than the site we were at. Would be nice if the putter golf was open to at least 7:30 on for the kids & a drop-off for putters & golf balls after the main office closed. Absolutely love this place!

The playground is in rough shape and has a bee or wasp nest inside.  My son got stung.  If there was a new playground, I would go back. We enjoyed the pool which is the best part of the park, but our experience was marred by a grey water hookup that was clogged and backing up with sewage that the previous site occupant had dumped. Pine Valley could not move us to a different site and although they sent someone to fix it, it wasn't fixed. They then said that someone would come and dig it up, but no one came. The facilities are also dated with one of two faucets in the ladies washroom not working and the lights not always activating. The playground looks nice in photos but my kids didn't want to actually play on it as it is not good for kids under 5. I would not return here with my family. Good for the kids but sue is money hungry. We told her our situation with the family and was fine with it. We stayed there for 1 summer and then came back the following season and she decides to change her mind and says we can’t share the trailer!, and made us pay to come in and use our own trailer for $40 plus extra to sleep!!! She tore our family apart. Also the park could be updated for the price you pay for the lot.

BRENT & NICOLE the owners and hosts are such great people. I live 4 hours away and this was my first visit. I must have called them 20 times after my first inquiry with questions etc. They really want you to enjoy the place and have a great time! 
 They have these really nice cosy, warm, well equipped cottages 1 minute from the A trail. You can park your sled right at your door! They have a full kitchen so you can bake, fry or broil anything you bring along with a microwave, kettle, coffee maker and a decent sized bbq on the deck! Pots, pans,plates and cutlery too!  It’s literally a home away from home. All you need to do is bring your food, condiments and coffee and your dialed in for a great stay! There is also a general store and LCBO 5 minutes away! The bedrooms are a good size and the beds were comfortable and the cottage was very clean! 
 My son had a problem with his sled that most likely would have ended our trip however when I called BRENT to inquire what was available in the area for parts etc, he replied an hour north or south and even that was limited. BRENT asked me what the problem was so I told him and he said he would be right over. BRENT took the time out of his day to do some repair work on my sons sled and a short time later we were back out on the trails. 
If your looking for a great clean friendly reasonably priced place to stay while sledding some of the best groomed trails in Ontario between Matawaw and Petawawa then don’t give it a second thought; call BRENT or NICOLE at Pine Valley! I’m so glad I did and I will be back again; with more friends! 
I would like to extend my gratitude and appreciation for an amazing stay!

I am planning another trip to this campground next year. A great place to walk.  And a great place to walk with your dog on the off season. We had a beautiful time on this beach. Fairly busy even though the park is officially closed. The water was cool but the air was hot! The sunset was fantastic! Geared mainly towards families.

We will definitely be returning.  The Shamadon Resort is the everything we've been looking for.  So quiet, welcoming and the safest atmosphere we've ever encountered in our travels.  Patrick was the added bonus of our stay and probably the biggest selling feature of the park. Great park. Owner down to staff take pride in making your stay best it can be. Clean well kept park. Something for all beach, children's play area, pool, beach volleyball, trails and horseshoes. Great resort just 2ish hours away from Toronto. The premises are clean, quiet and well taken care of. They have dry wood ready prepped for you at your site, water and electricity hook-up. They keep the rules of quiet after 10pm.

Lots of room for kids to play imaginatively. Love the Shamadon jumper. Dog park allows your furry friends to let loose. Pond has fishing, sandy beach and volleyball. 

Owners care a lot about quality experience. I definitely recommend! Loved it here. Beautiful property, very well maintained grounds, clean and super friendly staff. Most of the sites are more private than other RV Parks, the property is large enough to offer lots of natural spots, some nature hikes (although not long) and fun for kids of all ages. I certainly hope to make it back there. Stayed here for over 2 weeks with our troupe (2 adults, 2 kids under 5, and 2 medium sized dogs).  

Everyone with the park was wonderful.  Seasonal residents were welcoming, and very pleasant to talk to.  The large off leash dog park was a huge selling feature, and a great space.  The new playground was a hit with our 3 year old.  Beautiful space, with things for the whole family.   

More then we could have hoped for in our stay, and worth a look for even short stays.","Shamadon Resort is an upscale campground for the discerning RVer.

Bring alcohol with you tho,  as the general store doesn't sell it.  And no one driving the golf cart under 18. They will give you a huge ticket. Really impressed by the amenities, overall cleanliness and layout of park. 
The good:
(Went during a fall weekend that was pretty quiet and high risk temperature wise.)
- It was fairly quiet, lines at water park were nearly non existent. Kids could play mini golf as much as they wanted with no wait, plenty of seating as well. 
-Rest rooms were clean, showers in campers area were the best I've seen in over 30 camping trips.
-Did the campsite option. Site was large and offered plenty of room for two vehicles and a camper and a tent.

The bad:
-Maybe it's because my preference is radio free camping, but use of radios was very prevelant. Possibly because of the amenities you get the folks expecting a theme park experience? Had a run in with a fellow camper rolling in at dusk and immediately cranking the music so loud I couldn't even talk over it to get their attention.

-Also in same vein, Late Night Campers. 
In any camping experience there's always the group that likes to chill by the fire till the wee hours of the morning, which is never much of an issue in radio free camping. However apply plenty of alcohol and people ""forget"" how loud they and their radios are.

As such the bad issues are only situational, and there is always some expectation of lack of privacy, nothing that would be against the park, more an awareness of what type of campers are drawn here. Great place! Very serene and other residents are very respectful. The beach was amazing! Happened to be visiting during Butterfly mating season apparently. Was very nice wandering up and down the beach. Great place for family getaway. Water is very clean at the beach. You can sit by the pool while the kids are swimming in a supervised environment or sit on the sands and read a book. Paddle boats, water tricycle and kayaks are available for rent.  They do rent out snorkeling equipment but it's a good idea to bring your own.  Movies under the stars and in the sand is an awesome and fun feature. Everything you need is within minutes. Must visit these beautiful waters. I haven't been to sherkston since I was a kid! It's so different. I love all the different pools in the playground my godson just loved the splash pad.

Wonderful beach! Lots activities for kids.  Campsites are pretty Rocky.  Nicely shaded.  Good times on water toys.  I recommend bringing life jackets if you have them.  That way you don't have to rent one everyday. Boat and equipment rentals are very affordable. Nice clean well ran park. Great beach area for kids. Lots of activities. Summer house park is a wonderful place for you and your children. They have shuffle board, horseshoes, bingo at night, crafts during the day time, they even had an astronomer come out with massive telescopes one night set up on the beach that you could look through various lenses and see Saturn, Jupiter and the moon, so very cool. The beach is amazing and they have giant inflatable water play center with a slide, climbing things and monkey bars which reminded me of an American Ninja training center. Remember to bring your life jackets. Summer house does seem to nickle and dime you for everything and boasts an old persons mentality to sound such as having no radio request posted up in various places around the park. One day they had drummers come and play on the beach for two hours which was absolutely annoying as it was the same beat, ear wrenching and deafening. They have plenty of outdoor showers and bathroom facilities located around the park. They have an onsite diner and a decent store with plenty of almost four dollar bags of ice. They lack electric on certain sites meant for tenting and need to trim up the water front campsites that have too much growth covering the water front views.

Make sure to turn of the lights and turn on the video for enjoying the full effects.

When driving up I didn't realize that the route twisted back and forth through the campground and took a good half hour to 45 mins to get through. We will definitely be back again next year. The light show was fantastic and we still had the option to listen to some Christmas tunes even after the big day! Took us about 20-30 minutes to go all the way through, $30 seemed like a decent price since there were so many lights and so many sections! Its definately a must see next year too! WOW! Always wanted to go but never made it until this year.  Liked it so much that I went back with my sister and her husband.

I found the owners to be quite accommodating and were very helpful when we had questions. We would definitely come back to this spot and would highly recommend to others who are looking for that experience. Great campground! Small but beautiful with really nice staff. Camped right on the river for 50 a night! We will definitely be going back. 3 km from the main beach too! Second time camping here and just as great as the first time. Love the family feel, noise stops after 11 usually even before that. Tons of families and other children. Bathroom faculties are clean and have real plumbing. Fire pits work great, caneoing on site. The only downside I would say is you feel very close to your neighbors, its not the outdoor wilderness feel. So if you enjoy privacy that may be an issue. Other then that, great place will be back next year! :) A well-run family campground just a few minutes away from all the Sauble attractions. The campsites are nicely manicured, with more tree coverage than you tend to find at private campgrounds. Tenters will be comfortable. Thanks for a very enjoyable stay!","Located on the shores of the Sauble River, close to Sauble Beach, Winding River Campground is your place for the ""ultimate camping experience""!Winding River Campground is situated on 12.5 acres of natural forest, with the Sauble River running along the property.

With its clear, blue, calm waters and gorgeous sandy beach, it's no wonder it is rated one of the best beaches in Ontario! We had and excellent time camping here! Not a big campground but full of mature trees! Awesome owners that take good care about the campground! Love the little forest and the winding river at the back of property! We bike to sauble beach everyday about 10-15 min! We loved the place and we will return! Thank you Angela and Tim! We rented a trailer for our family this  past week and actually just checked out today due to work commitments. We were very pleased with the park and how close everything was.

1000 Islands Camping Resort unfortunately will receive a 1 Star rating from me after a disappointing end to our trip.  Read the full review for a fair assessment.

1000 Islands Resort falls short of a good stay for so many reasons and it's truly disappointing.  The resort itself is clean and well laid out.  There are several good sites with decent privacy.  It's super easy to get to.  But that's about as good as it gets.

My first and BIGGEST complaint is their sneaky attempt to get campers out by checkout time.  On the HOLIDAY MONDAY they did not open the pools. They didn't turn on any of the water activities.  Nothing.  Just stopped all recreational activities.  Horrible way to end the weekend.  In contrast, the weekend prior we went to Emerald Lake where they not only had all activities going but allowed us to keep our trailer on the spot until we left in the afternoon so our dog could stay cool in the trailer.  But hey, no biggie.  It's not like it was a HOLIDAY MONDAY or anything.

My second complaint is from the catastrophe that happened re the cart rentals and the poor Indian family that resulted in 5 ambulances on the scene.  A long story short: the staff gives no instructions on how to operate their cart (sounds simply but the BRAKE is not anywhere to be found) and this poor family of 5 took off down a hill, slammed into a parked truck and the end result was horrible.  I won't get into details.  But to make it worse, only 2 staff members went to the scene, looked around, and left shortly afterwards.

On a smaller note, they had no fire wood all weekend and we were told to go into town ""it's cheaper there"".  

Poor service.  Poor staff.  Left feeling ripped off. The good points - no issues checking in. Site is well shaded and no issues with water, electricity or sewage. Friendly campers.

The bad points:
1. Facilities are not what is represented on the web site. Bubble soccer field is not enclosed. Water paddle bikes are only available on weekend and water enclosure for that is also much smaller than represented on the site. Water slide enclosure the same thing.

2. There was only one blow up castle (a climbing gym) even though the web site showed many other types.

3. The pool was closed on the Monday of a long weekend and was never opened by posted times. Posted times were pretty late as well - 10 am even on weekends. They ran out of chemical testing materials and delayed the opening another 1.5 hours one day.

4. Very few staff. They don’t make any effort to make the rounds to check on things.

5. Only one garbage bin and no recycling available.

6. The playground is a tiny zip line and another slack line with rings and trapeze bar and that’s it.

Since the campground has come under new management the site seems to have deteriorated. Thankfully the section we were in had a family with kids the same age as ours to keep each other busy. We had fun here. There's 2 heated pools which is really nice. Some sites seems really small but some are bigger and more private. Not what we expected. Stayed there a few weeks ago for a night. Very untidy. Garbage not dumped. Very over priced. Was expecting more for $80 a night.
       Tony O'. Good campground, washrooms are kept clean and areas for kids to play and both pools are heated.  I would say I'm a little disappointed with the tables.
Overall decent campground, family enjoying our time here","15% off every day for RV, cabin, bubble tent & camping. Under new Parkview management. Located on Thousand Islands Parkway. Discover the scenic spot, with 1,864 islands around. Luxury club house with big patio & home theatre, 2 heated swimming pools with slide & hot tub, fitness room, inflatables, lots of children's facilities & family  activities. *Review edited after final day*

1000 Islands Camping Resort unfortunately will receive a 1 Star rating from me after a disappointing end to our trip.  Read the full review for a fair assessment.

1000 Islands Resort falls short of a good stay for so many reasons and it's truly disappointing.  The resort itself is clean and well laid out.  There are several good sites with decent privacy.  It's super easy to get to.  But that's about as good as it gets.

My first and BIGGEST complaint is their sneaky attempt to get campers out by checkout time.  On the HOLIDAY MONDAY they did not open the pools. They didn't turn on any of the water activities.  Nothing.  Just stopped all recreational activities.  Horrible way to end the weekend.  In contrast, the weekend prior we went to Emerald Lake where they not only had all activities going but allowed us to keep our trailer on the spot until we left in the afternoon so our dog could stay cool in the trailer.  But hey, no biggie.  It's not like it was a HOLIDAY MONDAY or anything.

My second complaint is from the catastrophe that happened re the cart rentals and the poor Indian family that resulted in 5 ambulances on the scene.  A long story short: the staff gives no instructions on how to operate their cart (sounds simply but the BRAKE is not anywhere to be found) and this poor family of 5 took off down a hill, slammed into a parked truck and the end result was horrible.  I won't get into details.  But to make it worse, only 2 staff members went to the scene, looked around, and left shortly afterwards.

On a smaller note, they had no fire wood all weekend and we were told to go into town ""it's cheaper there"".  

Poor service.  Poor staff.  Left feeling ripped off. The good points - no issues checking in. Site is well shaded and no issues with water, electricity or sewage. Friendly campers.

The bad points:
1. Facilities are not what is represented on the web site. Bubble soccer field is not enclosed. Water paddle bikes are only available on weekend and water enclosure for that is also much smaller than represented on the site. Water slide enclosure the same thing.

2. There was only one blow up castle (a climbing gym) even though the web site showed many other types.

3. The pool was closed on the Monday of a long weekend and was never opened by posted times. Posted times were pretty late as well - 10 am even on weekends. They ran out of chemical testing materials and delayed the opening another 1.5 hours one day.

4. Very few staff. They don’t make any effort to make the rounds to check on things.

5. Only one garbage bin and no recycling available.

6. The playground is a tiny zip line and another slack line with rings and trapeze bar and that’s it.

Since the campground has come under new management the site seems to have deteriorated. Thankfully the section we were in had a family with kids the same age as ours to keep each other busy. We had fun here. There's 2 heated pools which is really nice. Some sites seems really small but some are bigger and more private. Not what we expected. Stayed there a few weeks ago for a night. Very untidy. Garbage not dumped. Very over priced. Was expecting more for $80 a night.

We ended up having to leave early thinking we forfeited a night but KOA ended up refunding us for the night we missed which was very nice and unexpected. Thanks so much for being so accommodating and having great customer service ! Our kids LOVED this place!!!!   So many well organized activities for them. The staff were great, very well organized. Spots were a little on top of each other when full, but there are plenty of options to tent or cabin. I really want to try the cabins. They look great. VERY dog friendly. Nice dog run, automated dog bathing system available.  Rented a pontoon boat right across the street at Pecks Marina for the Saturday, that was an absolutely “best dad ever! Day. We’re totally happy with this KOA and will be back next year! A friend of mine stayed there for the week and I came up for the night. I was shocked by how great this camp ground was! It was clean, organized, there was an activity every hour all day for the kids, making tie dye, water gun wagon ride, outdoor movies, free popcorn.  Free corn roast and baked beans... huge park, really nice pool... my daughter was in heaven. I would definitely recommend for families! Park was fun n lots to do. Unfortunately as soon as it got dark no lights came on in any of the areas pools hot tub dog park the main office is the only place with lights on. Very dangerous for anyone. Also no life guard or park staff monitoring the pool at all. Kids jumping n diving into the pools Great campground and RV/trailer park. Cabins available too.
Propane fill ups, good laundry. 
Great stop off for the family with so many activities.
Cycling path goes right past, travelling east to Butternut Bay and west to Kingston, though after Gananoque you are on the Highway 2, with a cycle lane.
Locally though there are boat tours etc to do. Staff are friendly and helpful and abundant.

Where do i start... First thing...  booked 2 full service sites beside each other back in April/May... 
When i booked the sites i specified which two sites i wanted & I was told  that there wouldn't be any issue with it been after season... They don't take a deposit nor do they email anything out to verify the booking..( Which I thought was weird but the store manager said everything would be fine... ) 
Well should have know things would go wrong... I phoned up to the campground on the Tuesday before the weekend & got voice mail indicating store closed until Wednesday.. I left message and no return call back from them...
Son arrived on Friday afternoon to check into his site and they didn't even have us down in there booking book...
There was someone already on one of my requested sites and when i got there to check in, the young girl in the office had no idea what was going on...so she called the store manager up and let me tell you... She is the most RUDE person I have ever came across in my camping years... She made it sound like we where lying about booking sites back in May...
We did get two spots for the weekend... But when I told her that i was going to place a  review on the web site... She rudely said if I write anything negative about the campground or my experience this weekend...that I won't be welcome back to the campground ever...
But no worries I have no intentions to ever go back there...
 So to all fellow campers "" BE AWARE AND STAY FAR AWAY FROM ANCHOR BAY CAMPGROUND""!!!

Who needs to take a customer service course on how to deal in public relations Its a great place to go to for a week but do not go there for the full season they are fun nazis and if dare party past 12 ther will be an angry worded letter on your door by the next day or that's how it was for me still a great place to go to for a weekend actually after reading other reviews don't go ther at all First year such an amazing experience.

Staff are very inviting and extremely helpful even when they are busy during peak times of the year.

I used to camp regularly at this location while married and never looked at other locations after we found this amazing place. 

They offer amazing fishing and non motorized boating and even simple boat rentals and even a beautiful pool to use as the lake is tough to swim in due to it being very weedy. 

Latest Mix International recommends this location for camping or seasonal RV or trailer services. 

Prices are very good and below anyone else within a 76km range approximately.

@latestmix I loved it. Very peaceful and in a great location. I would love to visit again. Only one thing that bugged me was it had a tone of trash behind the main office. There not much to buy at the store but its fine towns only ten minutes out. Would recommend Owners where super nice, had issue that we suppose have full service side by sides and they put us in the wrong spot and then once they realized it instead saying something to us they called our friends that they not going be full service or beside us.  So we ended up packing up moving to another location in the campground without septic. But the owners where fantastic and pumped our septic for us. 

Getting ahold someone for booking was very difficult. Campground could be very beautiful if someone clean up and money spent. 
Only amenities was a outdoor pool which was very clean. Nothing else to offer nice quite place. I have been there for 16 years and every year is great though for best service they do everything to make sure water is safe to drink n the pool is always the best for people who love trails there is many and they are beyond fantastic if you find the one leading to the Indian head rock.

Close to The Dells. Close to Devils lake Campgrounds which was or original plans but you need a year in advance reservations for Devils lake. Nice pool at Bass lake. A pond and small bass lake within walking distance. 
 Bathrooms,  forget it. Worst ever . They try to keep them clean but , ya just can't breath in there. It rained the day we got there. One of our camp sites, under water. Our other camp site We had a camper so I shared my dry home. 
  The people running the place were pleasantly friendly.  I would probably return here, during a dry summer. I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Cabins clean and cozy. Bathroom and showers probably one of the cleanest of the campgrounds I've stayed at. Beautiful scenery and pretty quiet. Friendly personable staff. I will definitely be back! Thanks Bass Lake Campground for a wonderful time!!!!! Great camping area. A little close to one another. Small lake to fish (catch & release). Has a pool. Friendly staff Great place for camping with family. Sites are close yet still big amount of space per site. Small place with few regulars.  Not a lot of golf cart traffic making it safer for our kids to walk the campground. Brand new playset! Nice addition! Pool was clean and warm! The pool bar was cute and a great hangout place for us as the kids swam. Use of equipment was free (horseshoes, basketballs...)  Pond was disgusting, maybe due to low water?  And just a heads up, Bass Lake is more the size of a river. Very narrow and shallow for most parts.
My main negative review! I Do not agree with site cost for 4 people.  Many families have more than the typical 2 kids, like me and 2 of my brothers.  Extra charges for more children is the reason we choose to camp vs a hotel.  In hotels it is a capacity based on evacuations. What limits the people when camping in open space?  
I would totally go back especially since I hear the improvements the guys want to make at the campground!  Jumping pillow and outdoor theater were a few ideas they are working towards. We have camped here for 10 plus years. Love this place. The owners have asked us for many years to be permanent. This year we did. We could not be happier.

When entering the cottage it was freshly cleaned, everything you could possibly need the cottage was equipped with. The grounds of the park are manicured to perfection. All in all, a little piece of Paradise we were sad to leave. We have been back a few times since and with our children who enjoyed this park just as much. Nadia is the soul of the park, if you feel like having a porch side chat with an amazing , intelligent hilarious woma, Nadia is that woman. I am looking forward to making more memories each and every chance we get
I would recommend this park in the highest regard. No nonsense, no parties, just pure family fun and relaxation. Positive mannerisms by all we met  with smiling faces. 5 stars is just not enough for the fantastic care we were given at this park. 
Cant wait to be there opening weekend and many more 
Thank you Nadia and family for your compassionate care you put into every detail and make us feel like family xo
Shawn & Jennifer.W We were arriving later to niagara falls. We had called several campgrounds and they were the only one willing to accommodate us after hours. The owner was very welcoming and sweet, plus they offered us a discount. It was dark pitching our tent and she even came around to make sure we had everything we needed. I would recommend this place, I will definitely come back! We camped here this past weekend and had a lovely time. The owner is very friendly and accommodating. The facilities are kept clean and tidy. The pool was crystal clear and we had a relaxing time next to the pool on a very hot day. Will definitely be back. Spent the long weekend at the campground with friends. Aside from a water shortage (which is to be expected when people are filling up LG tubs full all day to their campsites and was fixed by morning) The staff checked in regularly to see how we were and if we needed anything, would not tolerate rude and disruptive campers making it very enjoyable for those of us who went to relax. The park is clean and beautiful and it has a small pool we had no issues with, enjoyed it and cooled off then left when others arrived so we weren't overcrowding. Safety is a priority for the owners and I really respect them for enforcing rules. Since the new owner took over. The place has gone down hill. I've been here for so long, now with the new owner my family campground will move else where. The owner is so rude and disrespectful, always harassing people about the pool rules. Never again this will be my final stay.. Very Very Disappointed!!! Do not recommend this place.","Niagara's finest outdoor resort. Pool, tennis, Bruce Trail, Balls Falls. Full hookups.

The beach was quite small but preferred to use the pool as the beach area that was roped off was full of seaweed and couldn't really swim.  Couldn't really enjoy a fire because of the placement of the fire pit,its on such a slope you cant sit around it This is a very good place to go.

even some chipmunks. We are in our first full season here and enjoying it immensely. The new owners are very helpful and friendly and working very hard to improve their park. 
This year we have new boat docking facilities and the beach is getting ready with new sand being added along with new sand at the volleyball court. Looking forward to a fun summer with many new friends and activities. Great trailer park.  Visited family and the children have lots of fun We had recently stayed here with the family renting 3 cabins. No air conditioner, our mistake as we did not check that detail out before hand. It being 32• in the cabin, all weekend was unbearable - I know this because it was what it said on my son's baby monitor therefor we could not put him to bed the first two nights, we all decided to leave before the last night... just a heads up for anyone else debating whether you can manage with fans... all the cabins are tiny and trap heat with no air flow. I found the grounds very unsafe for our two year old toddler. There was an excavator machine sitting outside our cabin with a half diggin hole,  concrete steps up to the cabin with a deep drop and a park was full of hazards. The beach is a small corner of water which becomes over populated extremely fast, and the pool was no different. If you don't have small children and are looking to only enjoy some fishing and drinking then this place is fine for you. If you have small children and expect to be comfortable in the cabin, pool, beach or park I would not recommend this place. While a few family member thought the new owners were nice, I felt they were never there. The power went out for the afternoon Saturday, so cooking and flushing the toilets were scarse, but on in a few hours.","We are located on the upper part of Buckhorn Lake, which offers the largest area for boating and excellent fishing opportunities for species of fish, including muskie, northern walleye, bass and pan fish.All modern cottages boast spectacular lake views.120 acres of beautiful, unspoiled countryside that is lovingly nurtured for your enjoyment.

Great place. Rob and Donna are fantastic I went here as a little girl and now I'm taking my kids and I truly love this place! They are so welcoming! They welcome you in like your family. The cottages are very clean and if you leave something behind they will save it for you and make sure when you come back it's there for you! The beach is beautiful and very clean and they have special things that go on there which I won't tell you ....you will have to go see for yourself!!! All in all this is such a great family place and also a great place to meet new friends! Oh and they also have a park for the kids! So go check it out please! It's for sure my new summer home away from home! Not very quiet. Bright lamps are on at night so you can't see the stars.
Nowhere to go nearby except by car or boat. I stayed in the Jennifer cottage and I must say this is the nicest and most modern cottage I've stayed out out of the local resorts (I've stayed at Elim Lodge and Camp Fisherman).  The owners were very friendly and accommodating.  They offered free wifi, although it didn't reach our cottage (Jennifer is the biggest and furthest away).  The picnic area in my photo is all you had to walk over to get a decent signal on the wifi.

The only drawback is their boat ramp.  It pretty much worthless for larger boats.  Its super shallow, I had to either submerge my truck to float my boat off the trailer or push it off the trailer (the obvious choice).  This isn't an issue if you have 2 people though since the ramp down the road at Elim Lodge is public and very nice.

Certainly plan on coming here again.","Picturesque resort 100 miles east of Toronto in the heart of the Kawarthas on Pigeon Lake. Seasonal trailer park.

Fantastic for kids of all ages! just spent the weekend there with my daughter, her husband and grandkids.  it was great right from the start. Staff was friendly and lots to do for all of us.

I couldn't give this place 5 stars as I have yet to truly experience everything there is to offer. I will say that for the location, and what I see this place offers it definitely deserves the 4* rating. Pool, quarry, play areas and of course the campground a short drive outside Ottawa! Really fun and entertaining but really busy if you are looking for a quiet place this is not it! But if you have small kids transfer and young adults it's the place to be ! Very well organized. Just got set up for the season. The grounds are beautiful and the place is quiet. We spent the afternoon in the pool and hot tub, fantastic. 

The staff are very friendly and helpful.

Will stay here again. I don't know why anyone would have a bad review on Cobourg East Campground it's pet friendly family friendly we just spent the last 8 days they're the first day we got there with a tent trailer Scott the owner's son came and helped us figure out what we were doing wrong very polite family. if you are complaining about the speed limit being 10 is great. This year they have a new playground. This weekend was Christmas in July here's a couple pictures. Thanks so much Scott for your help. I would NEVER EVER recommend this campground to anyone!! We stayed there this Labour Day weekend, arriving Friday afternoon. After being charged $38 non refundable when I booked, I was told I had to pay for 3 nights minimum even though I only wanted 2. I agreed because now I have no where else to go. We are shown to our campsite which is the size of a postage stamp and has no business housing a 32’ trailer. We step outside of our trailer, take 4 steps and reach the edge of our site. There wasn’t even enough room to park our truck. Our fire pit was right outside our door, couldn’t put our awning out and had no room to put more than 2 chairs around it. We left for a baseball game, upon our return we were confronted false and accused of speeding. My husband and I have been to many, many campgrounds throughout the years and have always obeyed and respected the rules. We understand and respect the need for speed limits, we are parents of 2 small children and would never put others in danger. My husband tried to defend himself and was met with snide criticism. After deciding to leave early, I asked about their cancellation policy and was told there isn’t one, once we were there, that was it. I again agreed, took my loss and we left. When we arrived home, I reviewed my receipt and noticed extra charges. I was charged for additional people and couldn’t understand why, it was just my husband, myself and our two children. I phoned the next day and asked what their rates were and how many people were allowed on a campsite. I was told no more than 6 people per site. Then when I questioned my receipt, they backtracked and then told me that they only allowed 2 people and extra would be addition charges. Right after they told me 6 maximum! What campsite only allows 2 people? If I was told this when I phoned to book, would never have agreed. I was then insulted on the phone, told I was just being bitter because my baseball team lost! How dare they use that against me! Not only was it untrue and unfair, it was so disrespectful and unprofessional. We have NEVER been treated so poorly or had such a horrible camping experience. Campers BEWARE!! Outstanding campsite! Very good customer service. Very family friendly with many happy children riding bikes and friendly neighbors. Well kept campsites, clean washroom facilities. We'll be returning again soon. All in all pretty good. Really nice and friendly people, lovely pool and well maintained property. Only downside is it's hard to tell where one campsite ends and another begins.","A quiet family campground with generous campsites and a choice of sunny or shaded sites, pull-thru sites and scenic tent sites along the creek.

We were able to come in early to decorate and take down decorations the next day. It was beautiful, and everybody had a blast.. Once we were all set up, (about 95 people) we realized we had more room than we needed. The room layout made everything go very smooth and the kids (and adults) had a blast using the jumping pillow and swimming in the lake. We had a wonderful experience with all the staff there and especially Amanda. She made the whole experience so much better.. We will definitely be back for camping!! This campground has a lot of potential. I visited it in May when there was a lot of construction so there wasn't a lot we could do. Once the construction is done though, I would consider going back. We had  campsite #17 in the pool/valley. The lots are small, but it was big enough for our ten person tent with a little room left over. We were there during a cold, rainy weekend and the beach and pool we're closed, but the restaurant/bar was a nice place to grab a bite to eat or get out of the rain. The bathrooms need to be cleaned and half the toilets we're out of order, but it was doable. Overall, we had a good time and are willing to give the camp grounds another shot. Everyone is super friendly there and the area is  amazing. Was skeptical when we got there. Was checked in by a teenager, didn't seem to know the rules or able to answer questions. Had a cabin. Need to specify more throughly what you need. Only had spoons, no sharp knives or forks. No can opener. Just little things like that. We were thinking it was small for our families, 6 kids and 4 adults, but didn't really spend much time in the cabin with all the fun. During the week it's pretty quiet, but we had the beach and pool to ourselves pretty much, which was great! Kids and adults both had an amazing time. The weekend got crazy, but in a good way. Bar filled up and more kids to play with. Cabin maintenance and more informative website on cabins would be nice. Maybe an update is needed. But, if you want a place for quiet family fun during the week and a rowdy weekend, this is the place. We will definitely come back, the kids cried when we left! Thanks for a great time! Ben camping at Crystal Lake for over 15 years super fun We go to this wonderful campground 2 or 3 times a month, this place is so family friendly and pet friendly.  All the staff there are so nice and always willing to help you out if you have questions.  There are so many activities daily for kids to do they will never get bored.  The pool is so big and fun for all ages also the lake have slides and water trampoline there are some much to do.  I'm the morning If you feel like not cooking there is a full breakfast Buffett with real good food starts at 830am.  There is baseball diamond and basketball hoop and a  bouncy pillow that is huge and on the weekends they have a DJ with great music.  This place is phenomenal very recommended great place very friendly and just an awesome place to go camping at.  They also have a full game room in the store where you can buy any type of groceries you need for the night or wood for the fire.","Best kept-secret in northwestern Ontario. Family camping at its best! Well-equipped playground. Horseshoes, volleyball, basketball, 4 km walking trail. Swim, canoe, bike, fish or just relax. 5 km west of Vermilion Bay, just 1/2 km down Hanslips Rd. WiFi available at no extra cost! Big-rig luxury, with paved roads and sites. We just had our wedding here and everything went perfect. We were able to come in early to decorate and take down decorations the next day. It was beautiful, and everybody had a blast.. Once we were all set up, (about 95 people) we realized we had more room than we needed. The room layout made everything go very smooth and the kids (and adults) had a blast using the jumping pillow and swimming in the lake. We had a wonderful experience with all the staff there and especially Amanda. She made the whole experience so much better.. We will definitely be back for camping!! This campground has a lot of potential. I visited it in May when there was a lot of construction so there wasn't a lot we could do. Once the construction is done though, I would consider going back. We had  campsite #17 in the pool/valley. The lots are small, but it was big enough for our ten person tent with a little room left over. We were there during a cold, rainy weekend and the beach and pool we're closed, but the restaurant/bar was a nice place to grab a bite to eat or get out of the rain.

My husband adores their disc golf course and it’s one of the only 18 hole courses I enjoy! Plus you can go for a swim after.

Paid pass is 5$ and so worth it. Next year we will get a seasons pass. We have a cottage on the native land in sauble so this is a quick 10 min drive for us.

I would suggest this campground to anyone, we’ve never been let down. An amazing campground. We have been coming here for 5+ years and will continue to as our family's grow older. The owners are beautiful and great, always treats all of us as family and great hospitality. There is always something to do in the campground and not far from multiple beaches. 11 out of 10. A very family friendly campground. Though it's geared more towards trailers and the sites aren't that private. But it's extremely clean and we'll maintained and the staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a pool and hot tub and a few swimming ponds. And an excellent play ground for toddlers and kids. The only downside i can see was paying for the showers. But otherwise it's a great place! Family owned and run. Lots to do for kids and families like a salt water pool, clean pond with floating water slide, horseshoes, trails, playground, pedal bike rental, and weekend activities in the 'Barn' organized by the seasonal campers. Lots of unserviced sites but most are essentially in an open field with very little shade. The best sites are P17 (classified as a Group site) P2-4 (right on the edge of the small pond) and P11 (pretty private and a couple nice trees in the middle of the site). The Bush sites aren't available and don't appear to be in use.

All the washrooms are cleaned regularly and are kept well stocked. The showers are each their own room with a door. Water is metered with 4 minutes running you $1.00 and a brilliant on/off button to stop the flow and the clock.

Wood is $8.00 a bundle and gets you far more than those dinky grain bags you find alongside the road. They deliver it right to your site.

Ice is $3.00 a bag. There is also an off leash area for dogs.

I have made special friends in the past years (including the owners).  Then my brother came to visit me and he bought a trailer and never left! The main goal here is to have fun, to make it fun it needs to be safe with rules.  There are no unfair rules here!   Wear a helmet when you ride bikes.  Have kids safe on lot by 10.  The planning and care that goes into activities for young and older is heartfelt and amazing.  Campers are encouraged to plan things and make this a second home!  If a camper wants to plan an activity they are encouraged and assistance is givin with the needs.  I could go on and rave about all that goes on here but I encourage you to come for a weekend and see for yourself!  Personally I would like to thank the owners for seeing me as a person and not just a camper.  For becoming my friends. No fun... Don't go. Owners are very rude. Plus they came and took the basket balls away from the kids. At 10.30pm who cares! They do. They came and took the balls away threaten kids and we didn't see the basketball the next day! There where other kids there too. It's very expensive! Not worth the trip. Great place. Lots of activities for the kids and adults. Owners are friendly and very passionate about their park. Had a blast here close too home the park is clean and has a river flowing through, you might get lucky enoough to see some salmon swim upstream here so bring a camera or some gear to catch one its a really cool park with themed weekends such as Halloween in the park which was this past weekend my niece loved it. I would like to clear a few things up about how most campgrounds are run. This is regarding a post that was put up on Sunday evening. Parks have rules that goes for seasonal or overnighters. Children have to be on there lots by 10p.m. . If you are riding a bike you must wear a helmet. In your case you found that it was above you to obey these rules. Golf carts are used to make sure everyone in the camp are safe and obeying rules. Your children were asked to return to there site, which they did not, that was after 10 p.m.. After speaking with your children a couple of times, the owner then approached the parents. The Sunday evening the same thing happened. When parents were approached again , the father was rude. And very belligerent.
In case you are not aware headlights on a vehicle will go out automatically after a vehicle shuts down after a couple of seconds you just have to be patient but instead you chose the route of being belligerent and started cursing and swearing at another camper, threatening them etc. You forgot to mention when you where asked to leave ,the campground paid for your taxi also refunded you money so there would be no more problems.

All and all  I myself  enjoy camping here there is lots of activities for the children and the adults. The owners have done a amazing job in cleaning this park up and they are very stricked with the rules. So with the games you wanted to play they got rid of the problem link. The park was safe for the rest of us and we did not expect them to babysit us.","Family-oriented park with large sites. Just a short drive from the GTA. With the beautiful Nottawasaga River and Sheldon Creek running through the property, which makes for excellent fishing and swimming.  Prime seasonal sites available. For more info, see our website www.eganscampground.com or call 705-435-7140. I came here to visit a friend 10 years ago bought a trailer the following week and never left!  I have made special friends in the past years (including the owners).  Then my brother came to visit me and he bought a trailer and never left! The main goal here is to have fun, to make it fun it needs to be safe with rules.  There are no unfair rules here!   Wear a helmet when you ride bikes.  Have kids safe on lot by 10.  The planning and care that goes into activities for young and older is heartfelt and amazing.  Campers are encouraged to plan things and make this a second home!  If a camper wants to plan an activity they are encouraged and assistance is givin with the needs.  I could go on and rave about all that goes on here but I encourage you to come for a weekend and see for yourself!  Personally I would like to thank the owners for seeing me as a person and not just a camper.  For becoming my friends. No fun... Don't go. Owners are very rude. Plus they came and took the basket balls away from the kids. At 10.30pm who cares! They do. They came and took the balls away threaten kids and we didn't see the basketball the next day! There where other kids there too. It's very expensive! Not worth the trip. Great place. Lots of activities for the kids and adults. Owners are friendly and very passionate about their park.

The park has a great deal of standing water in and around it. Be aware. There is clearly a lot of hardwork & love being put into this campground. We (family of 5 + another couple on a tent site), had a wonderful time.

The owners were very nice & there always seemed to be staff working, & patrolling around. They were very quick & helpful bringing us firewood & troubleshooting a power issue (note: don't use hotplates while camping - too many watts!).

We booked late in the season & got the pullthrough site next to the bathroom. Those sites were _very_ narrow, barely fitting our dining tent & no shade on those sites. But that was really my only concern. It was nice that my two oldest could get to the washroom & playground by themselves because they were so close - a new level of independence for them. 

The playground is old & a giant sand pit... not great but I was told that plans are in the works to re-do it. Awesome! If the newer showers & rec-hall are any indication, it will be top notch! I never fault a place for having issues that they are actively planning to fix: owning a campground must be so expensive & a bottomless list of renovations.

The salt-water pool was refreshing & getting a lot of use. The weather was roasting when we were there! The kids loved swimming... even the chilly man-made lake was a neat experience braved by our normally warm-water-loving family. The slides in that lake were very wobbly & made me nervous for the younger kids & grown adults... maybe a newer substantial slide with water coating would be a nice addition.

We had a few trips to the shop for icecream. Enjoyed the free, nice showers, and the new-looking laundry facilities. Wi-fi was spotty but free. Nice that I didn't feel like I was being gouged for extras. Even loads of firewood were affordable.

Sandy soil in the area & lots of sand-play areas so bring old clothes for the kids.

A well-run campground & we had a great time! Highly recommended. Lots of activities. Winding roads throughout the park nice to just walk. Kids and bicycles welcome. Swimming pool for the summer. Boccè and shuffle board. Volleyball. Small man made lake with water slides.  Everyone has their own fire pit.

Rented a trailer for 2 days but wanted to stay longer if I could. Nice swimming pool and hot tub for adults. This place is perfect for family camping. Nice and quiet at night.
We are definitely goin back soon. Great time! Lots and Lots of mosquitos in early July from the pond water. Definitely take a look at where you are camping your trailer or tent for the week/weekend as there isn’t a lot of shady areas. But there are a few. Water with the splash pad is COLD and my kids wouldn’t go in it. Pool shuts down for an hour (I think between 3-4 or something like that) for adult swim...that was kind of a bummer as my kids then wouldn’t go to the freezing cold splash pad after that...but all in all...it was a fun family weekend and we did pick a good campsite with some shade which helped. 5 stars for having a great pool hot tub and play area! They've really invested for families to come here and enjoy!! 

But only 3 stars for the camp sites. Small, awkward, not enough trees throughout.. we stayed in a well treed area but small site, ground was unlevel, fire pit too close to trailer. 

Still..it was fun weekend 😀 Amazing campground very friendly staff and very clean facilities. The children loved the splash pad with pirate ship and we loved relaxing in the hot tub and hitting the hiking trail. There is tons to do and always lots of activities going on for kids and adults. Highly recommended. Wonderful spot, lovely staff.  

Hard to get in seasonally if you have a trailer unless you buy a brand new one exclusively through the park, which you will get a spot however you still have to pay a premium rate for it compared to other sections. Otherwise you can get a used one from a seller on the grounds but most of the ones I've seen are overpriced and going for more than the cost of a brand new one.","Enjoy seasonal or overnight camping with family and friends.

Footprints is the most peaceful, romantic, beautiful, and abundant with amenities resort I have ever been to, and I recommend it to You completely!   My fiance proposed here, and he said it took him all week to do because there is honestly not a single location that isn't picture perfect for such a romantic occasion.  There is lots to do, on water and on-land, all on the resort and all included in the super fair prices for lodging.  All options for accommodations are luxurious.  We stayed in one of the newly built villas but the cabins, rooms and even campground for tents and trailers seemed so nice we promised we'll try those next time, and we are going back!  Possibly for the wedding!  
I could go on and on, we so thoroughly enjoyed our time here and our hosts were so amazing, they felt like friends the minute we got there.  They have thought of everything, jacuzzis, pool, watersports,  biking, trails, TV, showers, etc., the main understanding that everything is free to use; just be courteous and return it where you found it and clean up after yourself.  It's a resort only for adults, so that level of respect is easy to maintain, and we all want it to be just as beautiful for the next guests and our next visit, so who wouldn't!  :)

There have been many changes over the years but But always for the better.The staff is always striving to make your stay at HappyHearts an enjoyable one. Such a wonderful atmosphere! This has kept me and my family and friends coming back year after year. It has been our Happy Place for all these years, it is our home away from home! Thank you Happy Hearts! See you this summer! Have stayed here every year for 12 years,as we take part in the Bruce County Adventure passport. Staff are always super friendly and make us feel like family. This trip my wife and I enjoyed the small cottage. Very clean and comfortable and reasonably priced. Camp was very quiet being off season yet very well kept. Look forward to next year's visit. Supper friendly and helpful staff. Campground has all basic amenities and location is great as well close to the town. The pool is nice perk. I did not like $2 per shower and limited number of sinks available to wash one's dishes.
As is common these days traveling with so much electronic gear, it would be great addition if at least some tent sites had electricity available. we stayed here for 3 nights during our bike trip. The owners were great and very helpful giving us ideas of what to see in the area.  Although it was off season there appears to be plenty of things for a family to do. The grounds are clean and well kept. I would recommend this campground to anyone visiting the area. love happy hearts, definitely coming back next year. 
to start off, we were in the off season so prices and times and site-population is all different. 
dave - the employee I interacted with, was a very kind and generous in person. offering coffee for free and helpful information on the area.
the site itself was incredibly clean, they had an employee even cleaning up apples (from the apple trees) because that was the only mess on the grounds.
the bathrooms were immaculate, unbelievably well maintained for a family run campground.
the location was in between the downtown area and the grotto entrance, which was a nice plus.
this park has; 4 wheel bikes for kids, mini put, a CLEAN swimming pool, 2 sets of bathrooms, laundry facilities, horseshoe, and a little store at the front for necessities/ gifts. 
the only negative thing I could say for me personally is that I would have preferred a more private camp site (with trees in between sites like at other places I've been to) but, not having the trees made it so we could talk to - happily - and wave at all other campers while here. so not even really an issue because of the incredibly friendly environment. 
over all, I could not have asked for a nicer place or staff or location. very happy and will be coming back next year :)","Clean, quiet, sunny and shaded tent and RV sites. 30/50-amp full hookups, 15-amp electric/water sites, basic tent sites. Camping cabin rental. Gated entrance, $/free showers, free WiFi. Swimming pool, mini-golf, shuffleboard, pedal carts, tether ball, basketball, horseshoe pits. Store for snacks, ice cream, wood, ice, groceries, camping gear. I have been camping at  happy Hearts campground for over 30 years .Service has always been friendly and helpful. The camp grounds and washrooms have always been clean. There have been many changes over the years but But always for the better.The staff is always striving to make your stay at HappyHearts an enjoyable one. Such a wonderful atmosphere! This has kept me and my family and friends coming back year after year. It has been our Happy Place for all these years, it is our home away from home! Thank you Happy Hearts! See you this summer! Have stayed here every year for 12 years,as we take part in the Bruce County Adventure passport. Staff are always super friendly and make us feel like family. This trip my wife and I enjoyed the small cottage. Very clean and comfortable and reasonably priced. Camp was very quiet being off season yet very well kept. Look forward to next year's visit. Supper friendly and helpful staff. Campground has all basic amenities and location is great as well close to the town. The pool is nice perk. I did not like $2 per shower and limited number of sinks available to wash one's dishes.
As is common these days traveling with so much electronic gear, it would be great addition if at least some tent sites had electricity available. we stayed here for 3 nights during our bike trip. The owners were great and very helpful giving us ideas of what to see in the area.  Although it was off season there appears to be plenty of things for a family to do. The grounds are clean and well kept. I would recommend this campground to anyone visiting the area. love happy hearts, definitely coming back next year. 
to start off, we were in the off season so prices and times and site-population is all different. 
dave - the employee I interacted with, was a very kind and generous in person. offering coffee for free and helpful information on the area.
the site itself was incredibly clean, they had an employee even cleaning up apples (from the apple trees) because that was the only mess on the grounds.
the bathrooms were immaculate, unbelievably well maintained for a family run campground.
the location was in between the downtown area and the grotto entrance, which was a nice plus.
this park has; 4 wheel bikes for kids, mini put, a CLEAN swimming pool, 2 sets of bathrooms, laundry facilities, horseshoe, and a little store at the front for necessities/ gifts.

We paid $65 per night (3 nights) for water, 30amp (don't think they have 50amp) and sewers. Great place To be for nature lovers and kayaking 
7 min car from the dunes and 15 min to Picton Best camping very clean very year i go there and never had a probleme I have been going to the Hideaway for over 30 years it is a lovely camp ground. Close to the Outlet, wineries and shopping in Picton Bloomfield or Belleville. West lake offers beauitful sunsets warm water to swim in. Fishing is good too pickel, bass, and pike. Spend one weekend here and i bet you go back again and again."

They pretend to be all nice before you bring your trailer there but once you’re in there the owners do not give you the time of day.  The owners have zero customer service skills.

When we left we put sod down in all the places that we needed to and it’s been three months and they still have not refunded any of our money. We send them emails with no response.  They rented out our site for the remainder of the season and said they were going to refund us but we’ve never seen any of that money. If you owe them money they will put a lock on your trailer so you can’t move it but they’re in no hurry to give you your money back when they Owe you. Please beware and find another park. Nice campground, great family place to go to. They didn't fill the toilet paper dispensers tho and that would have been helpful. It also sucks that the water quality in the lake didn't meet the standard. They do have a pool tho and a rec center with lots of other things to do Awesome fireworks on Canada Day. Brand new washrooms. Friendly staff and well maintained property. My children had a great time there. Definitely recommending this place to all my friends! My suggestion for anyone reading this would be stay elsewhere. We recently booked camping for two nights at the park. The park is very well kept and the grounds are quite nice. It seems we were constantly being nagged and visited by ""Derrick, the park warden"".  My estimate is that we had 6 conversations regarding parking our vehicles throughout our stay.  It rained for two straight days and Derrick was concerned about the grass indents from our vehicles.  Seems a little silly that this would be a concern at all given all the rain we had.  I would expect that each campsite have appropriate parking but the sites we had were not adequate to hold a car each without parking on their precious grass.   To have the guy drive by at least 10 times during our two day visit and always have some sort of negative comment about his grass does not make for an enjoyable weekend.
   I think Derrick should be more concerned with the well being of the campers, than disturbing them throughout the day regarding when they are leaving.
  I would also suggest that the speed bumps be altered within the entrance lane as the severity of these bumps is very hard on trailers coming in and out.  I do understand reducing the speed for the children and campers but the numbers of speed bumps and severity seem excessive to me. 

   I have read through many of the comments and the flippant responses to the comments posted, so I am most certain that this one will be recieved in the same manner with the  type of response indicating that it is not the campgrounds fault and only the camper is to blame.

This  is a family oriented, pet-friendly campground just steps from Ipperwash Beach. We had the opportunity to spend Labour Day Weekend at this campground. The owner and the seasonal campers made us feel very welcomed, we were even invited to join them at their street party and pot luck supper. The sites and washrooms were very clean and the pool was very refreshing. It is also located close enough to the beach that you could walk The tent site was cute and the entire campgrounds was nice and quiet the two nights of this past weekend. Bathrooms were very clean. Walking distance from Ipperwash beach which is beautiful. Enjoyable experience. Will return the next year. Our family spent a week here and really enjoyed the area and the campground. Nothing like a full day at the beach and Barbecuing and watching the kids have an awesome time. Our kid's are younger, so they really liked the new playground. Highly recommended!"

(visitors pass, docking fees (in and out), wifi that seemed to get turned off)  The swimming pool was seldom open and theres virtually no activities  in the park. The highlight? Watch your hydro bills and get reciepts. (They tend to not like to give them) The energy board would love to hear about their gouging! $400 for 7 weekends, (Sat and Sun) no fridge, no air. My bill was low..some ran close to a grand and more. It could be a decent place and they could have earned 3 stars if it weren't for the ridiculous pair that run the place!  If you don't comply with their whims they will tell someone to tell you that you aren't allowed back on the premises! Did I mention that its next door to a firing range?? BANG BANG BANG!!! Stay away. We have only been here a few weeks and I cannot say enough about this park..We totally are enjoying being here,fishing is awesome..Owners keep this park clean and are very outgoing and helpful..The pool is immaculate. It is a small park which is nice and no loud parties.Everyone respects people's quiet times..My husband and I love this park. I have  had my trailer at the park now since 2014 and I thoroughly enjoy my weekends there.  The park is in a beautiful setting overlooking the Trent River . It is a peaceful and friendly park , where everyone has good times out at their campfires with friends and family, while still being respectful late at night of the sleeping  :)   The owners keep the park very clean and are very approachable if you have any issues.  The pool is a good size and has a real resort feel to it. The location of Iroquois Trail Campsite is excellent, as you have Prince Edward County, Trenton, Cambelford and Sandbanks all close by. Totally looking forward to my little piece of paradise at Iroquois Trail Campsite starting this weekend.

Highly recommended. The cabins are great. The starry nights amazing. Sunrise & Sunset.. Spectacular. Our host Captain TJ Chernuck was extremely Hospitable & Accommodating.

Capt TJ and her staff are so friendly and helpful. they keep the island in great condition and stop by everyday with water, ice and firewood which is reasonably priced. For first timers it will certainly be better than your expectations expect. so much to do between swimming, the animals, great viewing decks, mud wrestling if your partial to that, volleyball, boating, kayaking etc. and just so very relaxing. on top of that the accommodation was great (9 of us stayed in ECO Cabin #1). if I could make one suggestion it would be for Capt Tj to get fridges (solar powered as with everything else 'electric' on the island) for the cabins which would make life much easier for storing your meats. but it is certainly not a mark against the island and the awesome weekend we had. We will be making this a yearly tradition. will certainly be back again and cant recommend the place enough! thanks Capt TJ and crew!","Rice Lake, lakeside tenting sites and eco-cabins, specializing in families and large groups, bachelor and bachelorette parties.

Thanks! Amazing little campground not very big but nice relaxing place to take family It was a great place to relax and enjoy some boating A small camper park, operated by the owner (Janice).  It has a river passing through it and docks you can tie a boat to and a cleaning station for fish. They rent a small boat for fishing, as well as a pair of canoes.   The fishing off the dock was great, the kids caught pike, bass and lots of sunfish.

If you need a great wilderness getawa, Kings Portage lived up to its name.

Thanks! Amazing little campground not very big but nice relaxing place to take family It was a great place to relax and enjoy some boating A small camper park, operated by the owner (Janice).  It has a river passing through it and docks you can tie a boat to and a cleaning station for fish. They rent a small boat for fishing, as well as a pair of canoes.   The fishing off the dock was great, the kids caught pike, bass and lots of sunfish.  

The grounds are basic but include a shower station, a games area with horseshoe pits and a net for volleyball or badminton as well as lots of seating by the river.  Not much to do and not very maintained"

Only real complaint would be how close all the lots are to each other. If you're looking for a quiet getaway in the woods, this isn't it.

ZERO STARS We stayed the weekend in October. The staff is very accommodating and very nice to deal with. The park was clean, washrooms were average clean. I have some constructive criticism for the owners. Arcade, main hall, store was closed. Regardless of the reason you are open for business It would be nice to have somewhere to go hangout while the weather isn't cooperating. Instead we had to take some car rides to escape the confines of the trailer. 

The utv they use to service around the park at all hours of the day and night is a diesel and very loud and disturbing at night. The constant droning of the motor is very bothering considering everyone you drive by has paper thin walls or less than that! Please consider using an electric golf cart. Your guests will thank you .  Other than that the park is very nice and worth a stay. 😀 This place has really gone down hill since ""eddie"" the owner returned. He is mean and rude to guests and has jacked up the prices even more than what they were. This place is not somewhere I would recommend anyone go for their vacation. The campsites and rv sites are poor and cramped in a field, not trees and although the beach is wide it is unkempt and has algae and seaweed problems all the time so swimming isn't a pleasent option. I hope this place gets sold to someone else who cares and does something with it. Good riddance. Not worth it. Over priced for what you get. Only beach no pool. It's not a resort in my opinion, it's just a park. Not much to do when beach is bad in so called resort. Really bad experience with owner Eddie. Not a people person. There's a lot of better options for ""resorts"" out there. Two thumbs down.","Simply the finest recreation facility in the area. Our ½-mile sandy beach on Lake Erie is great for the family.

The campsites are Not very private. Decent bathrooms but the maintenance needs to keep up with the cleaning and making sure there is toilet paper! Showers are coin operated.
There needs to be some kind of security or night watch because people were very disrespectful and kept partying late into the night when my baby was trying to sleep. Usually quiet time is 11pm at most campgrounds. However they don't seem to enforce this rule .

Great swimming and very refreshing after a hot summer day of sitting around enjoying the park. Charisma and John are great hosts and John even did all the work when we cleaned out the tanks. That is ABOVE and BEYOND. This campground is a must see!! We stayed for only 1 night as we were passing through the area, but wish we could have stayed longer.  Charisma was extremely friendly and accommodating. The campground is very clean located right on a lake.  Bathrooms and washrooms are all brand new and the cleanest we have ever seen at a campground.  It’s obvious the owners have put a lot of effort and pride into making this campground a welcoming place.  We would certainly return if we are in the area! Highly recommend!! Our tenting stay at Lazy Rock was fantastic. Easy to find, right off of the highway. Nice and peaceful and very welcoming. The shower & washroom facilities were the best I've ever seen at a campsite. Just as nice as any home. The only thing that was missing was a fire as there was a fire ban on......but everything else more than made up for that. Will definitely be back.
Bob & Jill This little piece if heaven is absolutely amazing, so tranquill. The owner's Charisma and Jon are so pleasant and helpful. Relaxing under the star fiĺled sky by the fire every night, swimming, meeting new people, it was a great weekend. The resort is clean and quaint but the bathrooms and shower houses are by far the best I have ever used. Great job guys keep it up.","Rest, relax and recharge on one of our lakeside sites on the beautiful private Taggart Lake at Lazy Rock RV Park & Campground. Serviced seasonal and overnight sites available. 7 minutes from the town of Mattawa and only 40 minutes east of North Bay. A lovely spot, with such warm and welcoming hosts. Very clean! There’s good access to the lake, which is quiet and beautiful; I was sorry I didn’t have the time to take advantage of the canoe and kayak rentals! Close to the highway, so if you’re sensitive about sounds bring a pair of earplugs, but all in all a really great stay. Fantastic small park that is growing to meet the needs of their visitors. Huge clean showers and washroom facilities. Get a lakeside site and you can have breakfast on the shores of beautiful Taggart lake. Great swimming and very refreshing after a hot summer day of sitting around enjoying the park. Charisma and John are great hosts and John even did all the work when we cleaned out the tanks. That is ABOVE and BEYOND. This campground is a must see!! We stayed for only 1 night as we were passing through the area, but wish we could have stayed longer.  Charisma was extremely friendly and accommodating. The campground is very clean located right on a lake.

My parents went there years ago, now I've taken my so he there 2 years in a row. He's 4, but it's a great place for him to learn about nature without doing an interior hike. This is my family's happy place.  Friendly staff and beautiful views make it a dream come true. Stopped in for a great breakfast with a friendly attractive server and a cozy rustic atmosphere. Will definitely be back! Bacon feta burger is awesome. Love this spot! Fishermen paradise!

We were here over Canada Day. The weather was scorching hot and the campground could not keep up with the power requirements to run everyone's AC. I would say that 99% of the campground is seasonal with only a few spots for short term stays. We had discussed our reservations with the owner Neil. The day we were leaving, my wife went to speak with  him and there was some misunderstanding about how long we were staying. We did try and stay there, but due to the heat and lack of shady sites (we were in full sun), we decided that we needed to find a different site/campground.

Good fishing, boating, boatslips, launch in park. Georgian Bay access. Neil Walsh. I had a great time people are very friendly bathrooms nice and clean campsites nice and clean and the price was very reasonable If I could submit a lower review I would. We were here over Canada Day. The weather was scorching hot and the campground could not keep up with the power requirements to run everyone's AC. I would say that 99% of the campground is seasonal with only a few spots for short term stays. We had discussed our reservations with the owner Neil. The day we were leaving, my wife went to speak with  him and there was some misunderstanding about how long we were staying. We did try and stay there, but due to the heat and lack of shady sites (we were in full sun), we decided that we needed to find a different site/campground.

We were fishing off the dock and my kids pulled out 9 fish in one hour (bought the live bait). My kids LOVED the inflatable park in the water. It was a MAJOR highlight across our entire trip. Fantastic place that I highly recommend. Ron and Kathie (+ Bonnie, Ron's Dad, Ron's nephew and other crew!) THANK you for being such wonderful, helpful hosts. We were hugely privileged to get to spend time at this wonderful, private lake, with such rich history and established families. Your site is well run and clean, and you are at a prime location - midway for all the activities the Bruce Peninsula has to offer. 

I appreciated the 11pm quiet time rule and the amenities provided in 'Deacon's Domain', our home for the week. I was happy to see a picture of Deacon himself on the wall of the cabin, and it was a joy to bring my little dog to enjoy the week with us. The beds were insanely comfortable too - it wasn't just all the outdoor air making me sleep that deeply!

It was hilarious watching the kids on the water inflatables, and sometimes just as funny watching the adults having a go on them too.

I miss you already :) I hope to come back (I really, really do!) to spend a few nights in the Shasta Cabin. Bonnie showed me the inside and ohmygoodnessyesplease.

Sarah and crew Returned back in July, 2018 with my church folks.  By far, this site would be the best camping experience ever!  Everyone who works in this camp is super nice, including the owner (Ron & Kathie), Mike (Ron's nephew).  My group was big and a bit noisy with kids but they were very understanding and we tried to work out things together, managing the large group under control!   

Thank you again and see you in the near future (in smaller group)  HaHa!

Isaac We had a wonderful time at the Mountain Trout Camp. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We got a great site for our RV. Ron was a great host. Overall the camp was very clean and well organized with lots of activities.","Located on Gillies Lake, a clean, deep, spring-fed inland lake north of Dyers Bay (Georgian Bay). Fishing, boat docks, boat rentals and launch. Water and sand playgrounds, and a small beach area. Hikers welcome, close to Bruce Trail access. Small general store. Sites are large, private and treed. Pet-friendly. We enjoyed our stay immensely. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The washrooms, showers were kept very clean and modern. The portapottys scattered throughout the campgrounds worked very well.  The beach area was very enjoyable for all ages with inflatable water bouncy activities. Just sitting overlooking the lake was enjoyed any time of the day. We like to thank Kathy& Ron and their family for making our stay enjoyable.

It wasn't my first time staying here but it was refreshing to return after a two-year period. It was simply amazing! The dorm was very clean & tidy. I was very happy that my roommates & I had a room that led to a balcony so that we could enjoy the view/scenery (it snowed!). Also, housekeeping left us a very cute note (which I found very cute!). The food was very good as well, I was able to eat until I couldn't eat anymore. I definitely look forward to going back here in 2020! love this place lots of activities can't say bad things about it. Been coming here -to the trailer park - since I was a child. Back then it was very conservative and more than a little legalistic. It went through some ‘lost years’ of poor leadership and stewardship but today’s MBC is a great and rewarding family experience! Far more balanced and intentional. It’s busy, it’s alive and it’s growing. Always enjoy the weeks we spend here. The Women of Grace retreat at MBC is excellent.  The speakers are entertaining and challenge our faith; the food is wonderful;  the scenery is gorgeous.  One woman at this last retreat said she had come 36 years. It's that good. It's not often that a staff member will review and mention the staff program, but I think that in past years, a bad light has been shone on what it's like to be staff, and it really is incredible. The dorm rooms are as clean as you want them to be, since you are responsible for them. I find that it really teaches us responsibility. The management treats every student with respect, and staff meals are incredible. The community do not just treat each other as just coworkers, but as family. I'm working here for my first year, and it's only week two. We are already just a huge family. Everyone pretty much knows everyone. The programs for spiritual enrichment available for staff are incredible. You're not just staff, you are disciples, and although a lot is expected from you because of this, including attending bible studies, praise and prayer, and devotions, it has brought me closer to the Lord than I have ever been before. On the guest side of things, I have been coming here since I was five, and MBC just gets better and better each year.

After that, he returned to his cabin site and stayed there the duration of the weekend, fearful to go any where public or even join the large group we were visiting.  And the large group of families we visited with have 6 children amongst them, and all parents vouch they trust my brother with their children and kindly refer to him as ""Uncle Jay"".  He did NOTHING wrong.  At least he had a chance to explain his side of the story to one of the owners/managers, but I fear this will do nothing, as the resident will get the last word.  My brother, myself, my husband and my father in law WILL NOT RETURN EVER AGAIN.  What a shame.

What we found totally unacceptable was the lack of maintenance - basic cleaning of the washrooms and showers. When it got unbearably, Campers had to take it on themselves to wash and sanitize the washrooms and showers before using them. There seem to be no schedule of time for the cleaning of the washrooms and showers.  For the 4 days we were there none of the washrooms seem to have been swept or mopped!  In the washroom behind the store, there were pieces of celery under the sink for the entire time and this one was the cleanest DIRTY one.

Now, about the lady who runs the place - Overworked, yes,  but that should not be an excuse for absolutely poor customer service.  That skill set was seriously lacking!

Of course I would  NOT recommend this place at all! Clair is wonderful. Awesome to chat with. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice quiet relaxing weekend. Cant wait to try her cooking Was there last year and will be returning this may long weekend.
Very nice spot!
Cabins are so cute and comfortable, and very reasonably priced. Car camped here in November 2017 with 5 ppl - to start, really loved the idea of being on a island, the ferry worked out perfectly, good schedule. Arrive 20-30 minutes before the ferry to guarantee your spot. Campsite was spacious, clean, and came with a fire pit and picnic table. A good serving of Fire wood was delivered to us for 15 dollars and lasted us 1 entire day and all night. The views of the lake during sunset and the full moon were spectacular. Due to the time of year we were the only people camping so the campground was quiet and no one bothered us. The heated washrooms had a shower, sink and toilets all in good condition. The restaurant/store across the road was a good thing to have in case anyone got cold or needed a break from the outdoors. Both staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The nearby walking trails were also fantastic for hiking or snowshoeing.We were very happy with our stay here and we will be back again in the winter and summer.

This is a small family type community where help and care abound. Lovely private park."

Highly recommend this park! The folks who run this park are very friendly and helpful. The washrooms are clean and the showers are great. Each site has a septic hookup as well as 30a service. There is also camping available. Great location and great people. Can't ask for more Best campground in the area. Very clean and well kept. The sites are large and beautiful. The management is courteous and friendly. The location is just around the corner from Acton. I recommend this park to everyone. Wonderful find!
Heading home and needed a place to camp. Everywhere else had a 2 night minimum or was full.. they found me a pitch happily. We have been coming here for the past few years (on the May long weekend) as a getaway with our kids’ lacrosse team vs staying in a hotel.  A great time is always had by all. There is a large grassy area for the kids to play baseball, lacrosse, etc. They have a concrete pad with basketball nets that the kids enjoy playing on. There is also a playground and tons of room to bike around as well. The pool isn’t open, but the owners are planning on renovating it to have open for next year. There are plenty of other things for the kids to do, not having the pool is never a concern for us. The owners / managers take great pride in this campground - they’re always cutting the grass, the flowerbeds are done up nicely and they’re renovating the washrooms.  This is a great place to stop at if you’re passing through, a great place for teams to stay at vs going to a hotel for a tournament, great for families or couples.

There is a swimming pool with a large shallow end which was put in a couple of years ago and a small lake for swimming & fishing. The owners invested in a new dock recently and there is a picnic table on it so parents can supervise their kids as they swim. The lake is 'au natural', ie: full of plants and has a mucky bottom. Horseshoe pits are near the pool too as well as a small playground with swings. There are social events on weekends like Euchre nights and 50/50 draws but nothing I've seen caters to families or children.

Sites are on top of each other and offer zero privacy from neighbours.

Large lake for boating and fishing. We have a rec hall, shower rooms, laundry, children’s play area and swimming pool. Woodstock is 13 km away, and the 401 is a 5-minute drive. Pets on leash are welcome. Latest time for check-in is 9:00 p.m. This is an older seasonal campground which is getting pretty tired and run down. There is a swimming pool with a large shallow end which was put in a couple of years ago and a small lake for swimming & fishing. The owners invested in a new dock recently and there is a picnic table on it so parents can supervise their kids as they swim. The lake is 'au natural', ie: full of plants and has a mucky bottom. Horseshoe pits are near the pool too as well as a small playground with swings. There are social events on weekends like Euchre nights and 50/50 draws but nothing I've seen caters to families or children.

Sites are on top of each other and offer zero privacy from neighbours.

We went to balsam lake instead for a lot cheaper. My boyfriend and I recently rented a canoe from them to go backcountry camping at Kingscote Lake. The service is exceptional here. They  are always so friendly and helpful. We reserved our canoe at the last minute 
 (the day before)  and they were very accommodating. They dropped the canoe off for us at the lake  which was very helpful. It ended up thunder-storming every day while we were camping and  it was our first time taking our dog who doesn't appreciate the thunder so we came back a day early.

There are nonstop golfcarts speeding around the park all day and all night, people racing in the golfcarts at night appearing to be intoxicated. 
The kids park is placed right by the trail where all the golf carts speed through which is worrisome with all the kids playing which seems dangerous to me. There does not seem to be any structures or rules. Loud music playing all night and very rowdy campers until at least 3 in the morning. There does not seem to be any respect anymore especially for young families with their little ones. Not a kid friendly park. Love this campground! The lake is wonderful, the private grounds allow more freedom than public parks, and it's reasonably priced. There are showers on site for a small fee, good toilets, and neat camp grounds. They have food and equipment rentals there as well if you're not into packing up too much supplies. Every year they make more improvements and just get better. Great place to get away from the city.

It’s also 13 miles from some fantastic hikes and a less traveled pocket of Big Sur. The sites offer both fire pits and bbq stands which is much appreciated. We will definitely be back A great remote campground mostly open during week now that fall is approaching"

The pool, playground are awesome for kids and they often have fun activities.

We were down graded to a smaller, lower quality site, we asked if we were getting a discount on the rate to which we were told ""no, take it or go home."" We had to argue to get a similar size site just so our tent would fit. The woman running Prospect Hill was unapologetic, unprofessional, and ignorant. We will never camp there again.
Response: My review is honest and accurate. Honour your customers reservations, or why bother taking them? Another example of unprofessionalism, trying to blame a customer for your incompetence. We did everything we were supposed to, can you say the same? Great spot. Nice grassy sites.
Lots of activity on weekends for kids. Very well kept , well run campground. Beautiful clean washrooms and showers. I am surprised this park does not have more tent camping.. Lots of space here for That!

We arrived Friday of the Labour Day weekend and our daughter and Grandkids joined us in the next site on Saturday.  The park is sandy which is expected in the area and the sites well maintained.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to try the mini putt but it is on our list for our next visit. We really enjoyed the pool. The front desk reception area offers ice cream which my Grandkids loved!!

Everyone there is amazing!! For my family this campground is a 10+. Looking forward to going back. Beautiful place to visit. Awesome pool, playground for kids, and 3 minute walk to the gorgeous beach. Great central location to stay and visit all the best local attractions. We stayed 2 nights and it wasn't near long enough.  Our grandchildren loved it.  We will definitely come back.  The staff are amazing people. This place is a gem!! The wonderful people at the front desk truly set the tone for your time here. They are friendly, down to earth, polite and welcoming. My time spent here was so relaxing. Buying your wood at the desk is perfect. It burns wonderfully and is easy to get to your site. The ice cream at the front desk is a definite positive with kids in tow. My young ones took to all the wonderful people at the front desk, they are normally very shy, but kids can sense people’s true personalities easier than adults. The sites are well kept. Playground was a big hit for my kids. They offer movies in the park! What a treat! The pool is well cared for and a wonderful spot to spend some time. There is a basketball court and mini putt. The speed limit is 10 and it is abided by all driving through. The park is quiet by 11. Any questions or concerns you may have are dealt with promptly by the office. Most sites seem to be seasonal, but there is still such a welcoming atmosphere towards transients such as myself from everyone in the park. I would highly recommend staying.","We are a family campground with heated outdoor pool, 5-minute walk to sandy beach, kids' playground, 18-hole mini-golf, walking trails.

There is a sandy beach, duck pond (which is beautiful) pool, play structure, a few bathrooms & one of my favorite features was the trail leading to lookout point which has a view of entire campground and lake which is just beautiful.

However, when we got their- the front desk staff was extremely helpful and very nice.  The place is fun and a great place to be- we enjoyed our stay.

We were there for a wedding, once they opened the bar they had a water jug for everyone after the caterers left- we couldn't even drink it- it tasted so salty- my cider was more quenching that the water ;) . Same issue from the taps at the campsite. Bring your own water and I recommend that the bar bring in other water. 
Kids had a blast and would definitely recommend! We love this park, but the showers need serious attention. There is nothing, like a shelf, bench and hooks to place your belongings.

Stayed in cabins.  White Water Rafting was so exciting!  Guides were super fun and knowledgable!  Beautiful site on Ottawa River!  Love the common area! Great place for camping and kayaking. May also still do rafting from there. Beautiful natural setting. We booked a rafting trip at RiverRun rafting for June 27th. Because it was off season the trip took place at their sister company Wilderness tours. The rafting itself was nice, but we had to make a complaint about the trip, because of the group composition. The trip was combined with a school trip consisting of about 25 teenagers. Our raft was shared with 2 other guests (adults) and 6 teenagers. We did not know this in advance. At the start we assumed the teenagers will go on their own being a school group. 

Just before entering the raft we found out we had to share our raft with the kids. During the trip they were very loud and generally screaming to each other and the kids on the other boats (as can be expected from a group of teenagers). And it was a long 6 hours. We felt like being part of the school trip, which we basicly were, as the adults were the ones paddling the boat forward. At the instruction of the guide the adults took to paddling along the front and middle of the boat to be able to paddle in sync as the kids could/would not (they're kids can't blame them). They are so loud, imaging a half hour screaming contest about who OMG hooked up with who in a show called the vampire diaries.

This ruined the experience for us, because we could not enjoy being in the raft, the rapids and the beautiful surroundings as much as we anticipated. And was definitely not what we signed up for. 

We would have preferred to know at least in advance that we had to share the raft, or better being in a seperate raft. Us two and the two other adults in the group would rather have been in the smaller 6p raft instead of in the raft with the teenagers. They should have propose this option to us in advance. It is the most expensive activity of our holiday and afterwards we were disappointed as it was not the experience we expected.

We told this after the rafting trip to our tour guide. He gave us the advice to sent an email. Which we did, multiple times. We didn’t get any reply, not even an excuse. 

I’m very disappointed in RiverRun and Wilderness Tours. 
Don’t book a trip with them, since earning money is apparently more important as customer experience and service. Good weekend activity. Recommend. incredible. I don't have anything negative to say about this place. The camp ground was clean, staff was amazing, the rafting itself was life-changing for me. The rafting included quite a bit of nice surprises! there was live music playing Saturday night! the food was great. I highly recommend it. I will do it again.","River Run Rafting and Resort offers many different types of accommodation. Whether you are looking to camp, stay in a cabin or be pampered in luxury, it’s all right here.

The police allowed us to stay the night as they understood our side of the matter and allowed us to stay the night (going against Jeffs request to remove us IMMEDIATELY)  I would NOT recommend this park to anyone Jeff is the most uncooperative manager I've yet to come across!! I'm not a regular reviewer of things, but after seeing all the negativity about this place, I feel I should defend them.  As a last minute thing we decided to go here and camp with the kids along with some friends (everywhere else booked).  We were worried about the reviews.  But after spending 3 days here, it was AMAZING.  Friendly staff, kids had a blast.  Clean playgrounds, pools, showers and bathrooms.  People complaining probably did stuff to warrant a complaint.  We enjoyed our selves, stayed up past 12 and ran our camp fires late.  Sure the guys in the golf carts drove around, but they left us alone.  We stayed quiet to respect others there.  Not once did anyone show us any sign of aggression, racism etc.  Everyone working there were amazing and friendly.  Thank you for the warm hospitality Sauble Beach Resort.  And also for keep the ground amazing and comfortable for families to enjoy. August 2018- I have read all the negative reviews and I am disgusted by some of these lies. Some of the negative reviews must have been posted by the competition in town. Many of the negative comments make no sense at all. We have been going here for 9 years, we go as much as 4x a summer. If you only camp once every 5 years you need to know this is NOT a provincial park. It is a private facility so read the rules and regs. ALL staff are FRIENDLY AND POLITE. Washrooms are clean and well stocked and cleaned DAILY! If you know how to behave you can keep your  fire going after 12 or 1 but that's only if you have common sense and respect your neighbors. The park has a great mix of overnight sites & seasonal and the seasonal people are friendly and welcoming. The grounds are very well kept. The sites are flat and in pristine condition. If you have an RV, this is the best place at Sauble and it is 1 MILE from the beach not 1 minute. The website says 1 mile. If you know absolutely nothing about camping and campers then maybe try a provincial park first. We are camping July 6-8 2018 and love this place. Very family oriented and clean. Found the showers indoors and outdoors maintained as well as the washrooms are  very clean. The park for the kids was full pretty much all day as well as both indoor and outdoor pools. A very nice neat and quiet and clean park. Lots for the kids to do with movies Friday nights, bingo Saturdays, play grounds, volleyball as well as horse shoes for adults. Go for a walk or cycle your bike around and you will meet lots of friendly people. And with Sauble Beach being a minute up the road you can enjoy all the shops as well as just relax on the beach. Or you can go 5 minutes the other direction and enjoy a car race or two at Sauble speedway. What more do you need on a holiday. Staff were also very helpful and friendly.","We are a well-established, supervised family campground that offers modern washrooms, hot showers, an indoor/outdoor pool, a whirlpool, movie nights, wagon rides and much more. We are located just minutes away from Sauble Beach, the second-largest freshwater beach in the world, with breathtaking sunsets and 11 km of sandy beach. We love this park. Have been having our family weekend camp for many years now. Indoor pool is great. Outdoor kids pool is great for little ones but cold. Showers/bathrooms are always clean. Very clean park.

There is a large playground for kids and large grass area for lots of games. Generally, campers are quiet and keep to an 11pm noise curfew. The bathroom facilities are basic. They have fairly clean toilets, but the showers are pay-as-you-go and the water smells metalic. The outhouses are smelly, as expected, but some of the rolls of toilet paper were soaked with brown liquid (disgusting). The site cost is $39 + tax per site (for 2 adults and kids), and then an additional $12 per other adult, which makes it a bit more expensive than provincial parks if you have more than 2 adults. They also charge $3 per dog, which I find very weird and unjustified. Also, you cannot request certain sites. We requested more private sites that were further away from others, but were told that those sites were not available unless everything else was sold out. As a result, we found ourselves very close to other campers. If these issues were addressed accordingly, I would happily return, otherwise this was my first and only stay here. Nice location. Staff was ok. More of a trailer park that has tent camping. No wash stations for dishes. 1 water source that was on a occupied camp site. Porta potties fairly clean but smell. They were wooden outhouses. No lights so bring one in. Nice location across from Sauble falls. Less then 10 min drive to Sauble beach. Fire engine takes people for ride on Saturday mornings.  They had karaoke and DJ on the Saturday night. Lots of fun. We made great time to get there and they wouldn't let us on the camp site that was empty an hour early. Front gate has to be opened manually from inside the office that closes at 10. After that you have to park car and walk to campsite.  Gate to leave opens automatically so you are good to go at anytime. Great place for camping.  Friendly people and clean washrooms We camped here August long weekend for the first time ! I was a little nervous new place never been some reviews weren’t the best but figured I would take a chance and so glad I did !!! I’m from Kitchener have never camped sauble area ever before lol I Booked 2 sites as it was a big family camping trip and I was very happy! both sites were nice size with trees , staff was nice and easy to deal with! The main girl I dealt with Anika ( hope that’s it )was amazing so kind works hard constantly seen her working in office , watering plants, cleaning the bathrooms I swear the girl never stopped this weekend ! Talked to them before we came about family visiting and they allowed us to have extra people which was amazing ! People complain about all the prices —- yes they charge extra for extra cars tents people but it’s on their site they don’t hide that fact ! So your choice you don’t like it don’t book we knew booking this we had extras to pay for which was no surprise and we accepted that ! They have small little onsite store but right across the street is a much bigger store that sells everything ! Clean cute campground we had no problems at all ! Sauble falls is close walk right across the street was so awesome definately recommend going there ! We went  every night such a beautiful fun place ! Our neighbours on both sides of us were fantastic ! Sauble Beach is close drive like 5 mins away ! Sunday they did fire truck ride for the kids and the kids loved it even gave all kids a little treat bag nice little park as well for the kids ! Horseshoe pits as well ! But would definately recommend and I would and will definately stay here again ! Great experience ! Thank you !

We have visited many campsites over the last 9 years and this is by far the very best.  As a woman I appreciate a clean washroom above almost anything else, the washrooms are new and very, very clean.  The staff is exceptional in everything that they do, they are always working hard to make sure that they are on top of everything.  The grounds are well maintained, and the park is very family friendly and the little ones really seem to enjoy all the activities.
The tube-run down the river was really great, my husband and son enjoyed that very much, they went several times a day.  We loved spending our vacation here and would highly recommend Saugeen Cedars Family Campground.  We would love to come back.   Thank you very Pat, Tina and the whole gang.
The very best to you all.
Michael, Sharon & Matthew My friends and I have done an annual trip to this campground for the past four years. There is a lot of space on the group sites and the people that work here are so nice, very laid back and friendly. They have a bus that shuttles people up the river and tubes for rent to float down (or you can bring your own). It's definitely an awesome spot and the lazy river is worth the visit! Nice clean river for swimming or hop on a bus (provided by the owner)the friendly staff will take you up river so you can tube down. Spacious sites,pet friendly. 1st time visiting this camp ground and it was amazing!!! If you love camping you should book your spot, you won't be disappointed!!! Love that place, been there four May24's in a row. Only complaint is no sewer very rustic and is about 60 to 65 a night. We've been to some parks with every amenitie you can think of for that price, but still a cool place.
Worth the effort for a weekend The only thing this park has going for it is the river. They move you without notice. There are dogs running freely. No dumpsters on the campsite park for those who don't have cars to take it up to gate. The flies are horrendous that prevents you from sitting outside and it's expensive for what you get.","Every year, something new!!!

We are in a tent immediately next to ( I've stayed here on quite a few occasions and will highly recommend it to everyone! 

The campground is well maintained and the staff treat the place like they are the owners. Everyone is very accomodating and friendly. 5 stars all the way! Great camp side if you would like to visit Niagara Falls. The son of the owners was extremely helpful when our slide out did not work. The bus stop to to to Niagara Falls in right in front of the campside. Had a fantastic time! Would recommend to friends and family. The grounds are clean and well maintained. Large bathroom facilities. Friendly staff, always willing to help. Firewood delivered to the site. Good prices and so close to everything in Niagara. Will definitely be back!"

This is not just a campground, it truly is a community and the campers and staff made us feel so included and welcome as soon as we arrived right up until we had to leave. Great price, very nice lots and great service!! Awesome place must say! Two play parks for kids a pool. Dollar pool table, very well kept grounds. About a 20ish minute drive to the parliament depending on the driver and traffic. Owners are amazing! It's a legitimate family operation, really get that family park feeling. Will be going back and would definitely recommend. We spent our anual womens weekend here and had an awsome time. Very clean and friendly place to camp. The price is exceptional.. Prepaid 2 weeks tenting for less than the cost of a 2 night stay at a hotel.. The staff is very courteous and friendly.. The grounds are well kept and clean.. So relaxing.. 

I would most definately recommend Sleepy Cedars for couples and families to go camping at.. Love the camp grounds. I'm going back again in August. I borrow a neighbor's ten and it leaked I lost everything or everything got completely wet. So we had to go home. Normally they don't do refunds but I'm pretty sure they felt pretty bad for us and they gave us back our money for two nights,we where post to stay. Can wait to go back"

On the river, this campground has currently two levels of camping spots.  Seasonal campers take up most of the waterfront but there is a lovely beach for access.

The entrance / exit are slightly hidden and a little harrowing but the view is lovely. Be in 4X4 to prevent slipping and go slowly.

The spots are wide enough to not feel like people are on top of you. The gravel pads are very flat and easy to back into as they are set on an angle. All the electric plugs are 50 amp or regular 120V but they have adapters to 30amp.

The deep well water tasted good and had great pressure.  The black and grey water were easy to connect to empty.

There are tall trees and lots of rocks. The beach is Sandy but there are lots of shells.

If u found my review helpful, leave me a thumbs up. Great place to visit Still being completed when we stayed, but a lovely quiet spot on the Ottawa river - with a friendly, helpful proprietor who works hard to make your stay enjoyable Nice location, great owner, not good for swimming, and no shade Great spot on  the Ottawa only 50min from ottawa. ","Steamboat Bay RV Resort is one of the region's newest RV destinations, with over 2,000 ft of Ottawa River waterfront and 21 full-service sites for seasonal campers. We offer new Northlander park models, or bring your own RV. Our site offers boat docks, a sand beach, over 20 miles of navigable water and some of Canada's best fishing. À lovely, quiet and isolated campground near the city.

On the river, this campground has currently two levels of camping spots.  Seasonal campers take up most of the waterfront but there is a lovely beach for access.

The entrance / exit are slightly hidden and a little harrowing but the view is lovely. Be in 4X4 to prevent slipping and go slowly.

The spots are wide enough to not feel like people are on top of you. The gravel pads are very flat and easy to back into as they are set on an angle. All the electric plugs are 50 amp or regular 120V but they have adapters to 30amp.

The deep well water tasted good and had great pressure.  The black and grey water were easy to connect to empty.

There are tall trees and lots of rocks. The beach is Sandy but there are lots of shells.

Was smaller than I expected it to be, but the little kid pool was super cute. There is also a hot tub and a small horseshoe shaped pool. Only 2 bathrooms which would probably be fine for normal use, but not enough for a group. I would go back though. It's an OK place. Nothing special.  Nice lake. Not very good for RV camping unless you like to shake hands with your neighbors next to you from your living room. We had the best time fishing on this lake! And then we walked around at the store, which included a fantastic restaurant with amazing views. They had such unique gifts and beautiful decorations for sale, too. Spent the afternoon there, and the campground was super clean and beautiful trees keeping it cool  while 80+ out. We can’t wait to go back and we plan on staying for a couple of weeks next time. Loved the restaurant and the friendly staff! The food was, not only a great presentation, but melt in your mouth delicious! Chicken was tender and moist and grilled to perfection. The wrap was the best I’ve eaten! Go have a wonderful afternoon today!! Very nice area. We stayed in cabin 3. Other than there being a bunch of flies (like 10+) and nats in our cabin when we arrived we had a good time.

We were visiting family that has a condo there and have been there multiple other times for different things. The condos themselves are very nice. The meeting room and pool/exercise area are also very well kept. Our unit offered 3 full sized bedrooms, with lots of space 8 maybe more can fit, and a full kitchen. Beautifully decorated with a Michigan theme. There is an indoor pool, hot tub, fitness center, and conference room in the clubhouse across the small street.  The condos offer beach access and a private marina. You can rent bikes and I think kayaks.  Close to a lot to do in Cadillac like the park fishing, DNR, dance clubs.  I highly recommend the Sandbar.  It's situated less than an hour drive to Traverse City, and Old Mission point if you want to do a winery visit or nine, and just over an hour 15 away from sleeping Bear Dunes, or you can just relax on the private dock, or beach and tell stories st the bonfire at night with the kids. Very expensive. Not a normal hotel. More a rentable condo. Very nice inside though and beautiful view.","Wilderness adventure base camp on Lake Superior's shore.

Everything was clean, lady at the front was amazing, really explained everything and was very friendly. Very clean and beautiful yellow sand beach. Tons of stuff for the kids to do. Lots of fishing also. Visited a family members camp. Had a great time fishing and tubing. The camp grounds are clean comfortable and welcoming. Lots of trails for quading and biking. Strongly reccomend Michelle and Denis are great. Always ready and willing to help!!! All the reviews on the site maybe true by my experience was the absolute worse. The bottom-line is that the owners/people who run the campground are simply dishonest/greedy/untruefull  to say anything other than avoid this campground at all cost if you are looking for a spot to camp for the night.  The scenario is a booked a 30amp spot sometime in early July for one night, August 17 as our last stop of our return journey from out west. On Aug 8 the campground called to ask us to con firm if we are still coming on the 17th.  At the time I thought it was odd but I figured it might have to do with the forest fires in Northern Ontario so I called and confirmed we are still planning to come. On the morning of Aug 17 they called again to ask us to confirm if we are still coming which I called back and stated that we are planning to be there around 7 or 8 pm that night. Once again thinking why do they keep calling? I will mention that on this trip alone we stayed at 8 other campgrounds and they never called once to confirm if we were coming. So when we arrived the following occurred

1. We were not giving our 30 amp spot as it was “double booked” there words not mine

2. Was not given any camp map, no indications if there where public washrooms showers etc. not even given a spot number. Just took my $50

3. Was challenged on why I needed a 30amp spot  anyway because “It is going to be 6 degrees out so you don’t need your “AC” – Once again there words not ours

4. We were giving a spot that was not a spot. It was wedged in between 2 spots. See pictures

5. Was asked “Are you tanks full” meaning water tanks and I said “ At a certain point what I’m paying for?”  Was told I was paying for Hydro and water like the rest of the people.

6. I had to insist that I get the water hose so the other person on the spot lost there’s for the night

7. As soon as we back in the owner/person ran off to join the annual shindig

8. Had to hijack someone to tell me where the dump station was so we knew where to go when we left in the morning.  

So the only conclusion I had was they gave my booking away to someone because I was only going to be there for one day and instead of being honest which was please don’t come they took my $50 and screwed over 3 people for the night as the pictures indicate. They had every opportunity to tell me that due to their annual shindig we would prefer you not to come. They called me 2 times.  Dishonest/greedy/untruefull

It's safe for kids to play around the camp with other kids.  You won't be in the park long and you will have made new friends.  No nasty stuff like booze or loud music allowed.  You need a letter from your Pastor to confirm you belong to a Christian church.  I highly recommend it.  My experience (as I've heard others say as well) is that you can feel God's peace around you when you go through the gate.  It's not just for permanent seasonal campers.  They also have spaces for weekend campers. There's a fire pit in each lot, along with electricity hook-ups, public showers & bathrooms, and Wi-Fi near the office where there's also canteen that's open now & then to get snacks.

It's safe for kids to play around the camp with other kids.  You won't be in the park long and you will have made new friends.  No nasty stuff like booze or loud music allowed.  You need a letter from your Pastor to confirm you belong to a Christian church.  I highly recommend it.  My experience (as I've heard others say as well) is that you can feel God's peace around you when you go through the gate.  It's not just for permanent seasonal campers.  They also have spaces for weekend campers. There's a fire pit in each lot, along with electricity hook-ups, public showers & bathrooms, and Wi-Fi near the office where there's also canteen that's open now & then to get snacks. Best place to camp. Me and the boys had an awesome time tent camping. A nice wooded area to take or park your trailer and to be with your family. It has a playground, a pool and a pond, so lots to do with your kids. Great people realy nice family campground with great amenaties"

It is also apart of KOA and is right off 400hwy next to Tanger Outlet. Great people. Cabins are good. TV and a keurig Coffee maker and small fridge in them.  Good price only thing against it is that is close to the highway so never really that quiet. Pretty nice park near the outlet mall off the 400 &89 Highways. There are lots of activities and a shuttle bus to the mall. Friendly fellow campers but....We found some of the people near us were noisy way  past the quiet time each evening and would have appreciated them toning it down a bit. Park management should maybe check on that after midnight. Lots of amenities and clean friendly campground. Good spot on travel through to further north destinations. I like how this particular KOA has improved some of their activities over the past few years and have added more things for kids and adults to enjoy. I will definitely be returning next year to enjoy some of the new things.","Set in a convenient location just north of Toronto, this KOA offers extra-long deluxe pull-thru sites, and you’re just 25 minutes to Canada’s Wonderland.

Beautiful countryside. This is a wonderful park that we make several trips to each year. This was the original landing point of United Empire Loyalists in Lennox and Addington County. As such, there is a small museum dedicated to the preservation of this history, and there is a small graveyard to explore. This park offers camping with or without electrical hook-up. They do have the option to park your camper for the season for a fee. There is a sand beach with a rope boundary, but there are no lifeguards on duty. The grounds have lots of mature trees for shade, and there always seems to be a slight breeze off of the lake to keep cool. There is a play structure with swings for kids, but it could use some updating. To keep with the UEL heritage theme, there are boats scattered throughout park that would have resembled ones of the time. The cost to enter the park is $5.00/car unless there is something going on at campground like a concert or a historical reenactment.

Overall, this is a quiet park that is more than worth the entrance fee. I can easily waste my entire day in this park.

Great place to go with kids of all ages, excellent campground for family vacations, Ruth and Dave (owners) are fantastic people and there staff are amazing, always something to do for everyone","Highway 401 exit 758 north Upper Canada Road (0.5 km). Recreational program, theme weekends in summer, pools, man-made pond, all-purpose court. Upper Canada Village (4 km), golf, marina, summer theatre nearby. Nice place and great facilities for the kids. Personally it doesn't feel much like camping in ""nature"", but it would be a good place for a quick stop (it's right off the 401). So if you want a place to stay with kids or don't care about being more ""in the woods"", it's a good choice Love, love, love this place! Had a site next the the park so the kids could play and we could still see them while having time to ourselves. Lots of friendly people and plenty of kids. Amazing owners, and facility featuring a pool, small beach, huge modern playground, basketball court, bouncy castle, and so on. They also have a couple friendly goats, and a pot belly pig. Bring the kids for a weekend, visit Upper Canada Village and Prehistoric World. Great people. We just had an overnight here. Sites are small. If you have kids it’s a great place to come. Lots for them to do. Showers are large and are separate to  the bathrooms. Need quarters. Washroom also big but a little dated. Had a great time.

We only stayed one night, after finding it on google, but we would most definitely go back!  The views, the downtown life while having a beautiful beach just steps away.

Waterfront sites are beautiful with full sewer, water, and hydro hook-ups. We enjoyed our labour day long weekend with toddler and dog. This was a great location to enjoy the waterfront festival from. Lost hydro on the Sunday of Canada day long weekend. But they had it fixed within a few hours. No small feat to get an electrician on that short notice. Well done and many thanks. Great little campground, but don't expect to walk right into a good spot. Sites are reserved nearly a year in advance(as there is only approx 50-75 sites). The Great sites are 20' away from Cobourg Beach. Bathroom requires a key and the exhaust fans are broken(lots of humidity/slippery floors). Still a fun time for anyone looking to be close to downtown(5 min walk) beach & water. Poorly run municiple park on Lake Ontario. Location is fantastic. With only a bit of oversite this could be a wonderful 5 star camp ground. My take is the town is actively trying to fail this gem in the rough so they can sell it off to developers.
This is our second year staying at this park for the annual Rib Fest. Next year we will book a hotel or not attend.","Enjoy beautiful Victoria Park Campground & Marina on the Rideau Canal, conveniently located just steps from the Smiths Falls downtown shops (and also big-box stores).

Each cabin is a little bit different so pay attention, but most have full kitchen, separate living and bed areas, and full living space.  Absolutely recommend We loved this place, we came here for our anniversary and definitely have plans to go back.  The cabin was clean and nice, the stay was relaxing and the scenery was beautiful. The staff was very friendly with great customer service which is a big plus for me. Our only problem was the people in the cabin next to us had a barking dog that would bark everytime they took it outside and made no attempts to keep him quit so sleeping past 6 am was impossible. So next time we will try to get a cabin more secluded. All in all it was a pleasant stay. Everything is as described, surrounded by pine trees, friendly, helpful staff acting as concierge. With directions for pet friendly trails. Rustic yet clean and comfy, cozy. Firewood provided daily.

Had a great experience up here. Great family run business and lots of activities to keep to kids entertained and busy.  The lake was fantastic, the park not so much. 

The campsites are super close together and you have no privacy. My family wasn't given a specific site number when we booked months in advance and had asked for a shaded site with privacy. When reaching the campground we were shoved into a small lot with the seasonal camping.

""Take part in a wide range of activities available for your enjoyment!""
Their website offers planned activities, boat & canoe rentals, mini golf, horseshoes and others.
While visiting this campground, there was no planned events during the week and there was hardly any advertising for a planned event on a weekend morning. 

Their boat and equipment rentals are absolutely ridiculous! I am not putting down a $500 damaged deposit on top of a $100 6-hour rental fee to ride on an already damaged pontoon boat with no shade cover and moss growing in the bottom of it. My family and I also were informed by seasonal campers that they had witnessed this boat breaking down before it was able to make it to the heart of the lake. The dock conditions are absolutely horrible, not safe to have small children or anyone for that matter walking on the offshoots of the main dock. Soft boards and terrible stability. 

The mini golf course is another feature that is not safe to use. I am not willing to pay to play on this small course with the risk of falling through the floor and breaking my ankle. Also, while visiting I did not see a horseshoe pit anywhere and their basketball course was over sand and grass.

It is also offered that there is a snack bar down on the beach, but not once did I see it open during the whole week we stayed there.

Also while staying there, you have to pay a $2 garbage fee for every bag that you fill. I find this to be ridiculous, I have never visited a park where you have to pay to use the garbage system. Also when leaving the park, we were chased down by an owner to make sure that we had put tags on the garbage before disposing of it. I mean, really? That wasn't necessary at all. If they're so worried about their garbage system maybe they should set up more garbage cans around the park, other than the 1 down by the beach.

These people seem to nickel and dime you every chance they get! We had family friends visiting for the night who were expecting to pay a small fee to spend the night. It is noted that an overnight visitor is to pay $8 on the signs outside and inside of the store. When our visitor showed up, she was told she would have to pay the $8 fee, but when rung up she was charged tax when there was no note of that anywhere. It is quite ridiculous that they tax overnight visitors. For Pete's sake, they give you penny candy for change since pennies aren't accepted anymore!

The prices for firewood are insane! Paying $7 for a small milk crate filled with tiny quarters of wood that aren't fully dried out is disgusting. We were smoked out with every fire we had.

It's sad to say that the park conditions did not meet up to their advertising, but the only good thing about the place is the lake it is located on. Lake Kashwakamak is absolutely huge with gorgeous scenery. The fishing was great and the beach was decent, but it's such a shame there are no other private campgrounds for overnight trailer campers on the lake.

My family and I will definitely not be visiting this park again.","Hwy 7 to Kaladar, north on Hwy 41 to Harlowe Road, turn right and follow signs. Family camping.

I am not putting down a $500 damaged deposit on top of a $100 6-hour rental fee to ride on an already damaged pontoon boat with no shade cover and moss growing in the bottom of it. My family and I also were informed by seasonal campers that they had witnessed this boat breaking down before it was able to make it to the heart of the lake. The dock conditions are absolutely horrible, not safe to have small children or anyone for that matter walking on the offshoots of the main dock. Soft boards and terrible stability. 

The mini golf course is another feature that is not safe to use. I am not willing to pay to play on this small course with the risk of falling through the floor and breaking my ankle. Also, while visiting I did not see a horseshoe pit anywhere and their basketball course was over sand and grass.

It is also offered that there is a snack bar down on the beach, but not once did I see it open during the whole week we stayed there.

Also while staying there, you have to pay a $2 garbage fee for every bag that you fill. I find this to be ridiculous, I have never visited a park where you have to pay to use the garbage system. Also when leaving the park, we were chased down by an owner to make sure that we had put tags on the garbage before disposing of it. I mean, really? That wasn't necessary at all. If they're so worried about their garbage system maybe they should set up more garbage cans around the park, other than the 1 down by the beach.

These people seem to nickel and dime you every chance they get! We had family friends visiting for the night who were expecting to pay a small fee to spend the night. It is noted that an overnight visitor is to pay $8 on the signs outside and inside of the store. When our visitor showed up, she was told she would have to pay the $8 fee, but when rung up she was charged tax when there was no note of that anywhere. It is quite ridiculous that they tax overnight visitors. For Pete's sake, they give you penny candy for change since pennies aren't accepted anymore!

The prices for firewood are insane! Paying $7 for a small milk crate filled with tiny quarters of wood that aren't fully dried out is disgusting. We were smoked out with every fire we had.

It's sad to say that the park conditions did not meet up to their advertising, but the only good thing about the place is the lake it is located on. Lake Kashwakamak is absolutely huge with gorgeous scenery. The fishing was great and the beach was decent, but it's such a shame there are no other private campgrounds for overnight trailer campers on the lake.

My family and I will definitely not be visiting this park again."

The bay is quiet and not far to the lake, where the spring bass were very active.

Oops.
Lol Great camping! Friendly neighbours, a dedicated playground for the children, clean facilities, and tennis courts - all made this an enjoyable experience! Woodland campsite is a nice, clean and also relaxing place to be. Also, it is kid friendly, a no pets allowed area and it has clean washrooms too. Enjoyed the park, but a couple things I didnt like.  It was advertised and reserved for $55/night but when I got there she added $5/night because it was going to be a hot weekend with a/c Took my wife and kids on a short notice get away to Woodland.
All I can say is WOW! The place is so beautiful and picturesque, very calm and relaxing, yet theres lots to see and do.
We were treated very well by the staff and honestly wouldnt change a thing about this place.
Loved it so much we booked 5 more days for August!","30 km north of Peterborough to Lakehurst. This quiet family campground has much to offer. Located on beautiful Buckhorn Lake.

Lots of children activities, overall a good experience.

UPDATE: several months later, stayed another weekend and was able to get a nice level shaded campsite. AWESOME! All i can say is wow! We have a family of 4 and there were endless activities to do. Excellent staff and the new General Managers are awesome.

Hesitant to say this just because everyone will want to go....but the fireworks were awesome.....2 nights in a row and 25 minutes long. This was all for New Years and this display was on par with any i have see  in a big city.

Special thanks to Ranger Billy!  He made us feel comfortable and made sure that we were having a great time!! We were there the 1st of December 2018. It turned out to be rain everyday we were there but we still had a nice time. Last year went went during New Years and the kids had a blast. They set up rock climbing, ice slide, and the fake snow was fun as well. My favorite part about the park is it is so family friendly. The kids can ride their bikes and just be kids. We’ve stayed here twice  while passing through in our 43 ‘ big rig with a jeep in tow.  It has always been easy in , easy out for us.  We’ve been through during summer ( quite busy,  not sure if the pools and such aren’t also used for townspeople ) and winter.  We will use again as it’s the best in the area we have found for a big rig.  A little more in $ than others in the area. This is a great campground my family enjoys every time we visit.  The staff are very very helpful setting you up, if you need it and a great atmosphere.   Kids love Gaga ball, that’s all they talk about.   Love the New Years celebration.  Esp the early fireworks for the kids.   My kids asked me this week,  can we go back to Jellystone.  Not much more to say.","There is always a lot to do at Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park.
