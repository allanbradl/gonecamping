The beach is small, but the campground itself is close to a multitude of other beaches, landscapes, and adventures. There are many places to rent boats close by. This campground is home to the Lake of Two Rivers Store as well which is filled with many souvenirs, a small grocery section, and any other things you may have forgot to pack with you! There’s even a cafe which serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, and carries Kawartha ice cream.

The not rocky beaches are a bit of a walk away, from the parking lot making it a bit inconvenient to travel with little ones. But be reassured, it is qell worth the hike! 
And the hiking trail called beaver pond was disappointing with no pond, and barely any remains of beaver activity. It was a boardwalk which made it accessible.
The only downfall of the campground is with the large trees there was much open space in between causing the neighbours to be clearly see on all sides, not much privacy, but most of the camp sites are shaded. And the lack of a visitor Centre is disappointing.

Some sites are not private at all. Our site had a water tap in the corner so people were constantly walking past to a point we ended up moving sites. Next site had hydro post right in the middle so neighborhoods had to walk in to plug in. Again not very private.

Washrooms are good but they could use more to service such a large park. Even just some portables would be fine even if just on long weekends.

Park store ran out of a lot of supplies during labour day weekend. Understandably it's the last long weekend of summer but people still pay full price to camp and should be offered full service.

Trains are LOUD and blow horns in the middle of the night, not sure if anything can be done about that.

The beach is cleaned every morning so it is clean and the added bonus is the free fishing lesson and free fishing material rental for.

Lots of seasonal RVs so most campgrounds are reserved with no occupants actually being there, so it's fairly empty and private. Showers, toilets, and laundry equipment are fairly dated and not super clean. The lake and beach are freaking amazing, clear water with a rocky ground. Great for boating and canoeing. Nice small boat launch but needs cleats. Not appropriate for fishing. Pets must be on leash but people are obnoxious and tend to set their pets free to harrass others, park staff don't seem to care. There's a beautiful trail with a great panoramic view of the lake, short hike (45 minutes) but challenging.

Hiking to the camp site is 5 kms from the office parking lot, however the incline/decline can be +/- 80feet in some locations.

The trail is pretty well maintained however over the course of the winter some larger trees have fallen over selections of the trail that require minimal deviations.

The mosquitoes are the worst of the trip, however with a good current of wind from the river and/or fire smoke they can be tamed. After 8pm they all but disappeared every night.

Each site at camp 7 had it's own 'bear box' (pictures), picnic tables and grill fire pit.

These items added more security and reveal knowing bears aren't an issue, there is a place to sit for meals and the food we bring can be luxurious in taste. We had steak the first night, chicken breasts for second and third nights. 

There is plenty of fire wood and material on the ground to use to start a fire, but having fire starters (lint from dryer and fire starters from dollar store) worked wonders for Day 2 when it heavily rained all day/night.

If you plan a long stay make sure to have a day pack with your expedition pack to insure you can travel to other parts of the Park and it is a must to purchase a detailed park map which can aid in your exploration.

Frontenac park has more to offer so do your research and call the office to be informed.

DON'T CHASE THE LOONS
DON'T CHASE THE TURTLES. If you see a turtle on a road, move it to the side it was going towards.

Granite Ridge, posted as mild - moderate, with some steep parts.  It was posted at 1 and a half to 2 hours.  It was beautiful. 

The trails take a lot longer than the posted time, so add at least a quarter of the time unless you want to just hoof it and not stop to enjoy the beauty.  If you take a trail book and stop to read about each spot along the trail, then double the posted trail time.  Hugh variety of nature along the paths.

The steep part of the trail was basically rock climbing. It was a bit difficult in some spots and this was the shortest and easiest of the trails.

So worth it though. The Canadian North is gorgeous.

Only negative thing as many people have mentioned. The STUPIDITY of putting the parking lot at the middle of the trail. Having the parking lot at the head or tail of the trail makes more sense to me. The parking fee of $5.25 for 2 hours is just a money grab. I also understand that funding is required to maintain the park. I am not happy about it but willing to pay for the maintenance. 
What I am most upset about is the fact that you have to type in your license plate when you get your parking ticket. WHY ??

So basically we were paying for a parking, far away same price as in downtown of a big city !
There was also fire-ban, and a lot a lot of mosquitoes, but the park can not do anything about it. The water was also dirty.",1531939234

I stayed at site #19 for 12 nights. The campsite was okay, not flat at all and the firepit was in an awkward spot, but you basically have your own private beach at the site so it was well worth it! Especially if you have dogs as there are limited spots you can let them go swimming.
Beautiful place! If you are a nature lover looking to get away from it all this is a great place to visit. However, the trails are not that well maintained- so if you are looking for a place with really great trails this is probably not it. 
No showers is definitely a downside, my group also stopped using the vault toilets unless absolutely necessary due to the fact that they are all infested with HUGE wolf spiders. (The handicap bathroom does not have spiders).

We got there at 8am on a misty day, thinking it wouldn't be busy. Didn't think it was that much to park there, found price bit high for the trails. Would be great if that had flat fees for all the walking trails and parks. I myself found $17.50 for the day and they offered 4 hours $7.50 (we took). With taking the 4 hour parking, we where always watching our time and rushed a bit to see the hole trail. Now I could of spent the hole day there if not for the cost of parking. 
That aside... the beauty on the trails at fall time was without words really. Great place to walk with the kids... that said - parents, kids will get dirty as it's a nature trail (as asked on the way out by a mom) and a misty day. 
Look at some of the photos we got... going to do a girls trip there again! Maybe spring time for new growth.

Due to the warm fall in Southern Ontario this year, we even had a beach day in September. The waters here are very shallow and warm up fast and stay warm. Walk out on the soft sandy bottom and gaze at the vast beach far behind you - with water barely up to an adults waist. Go out a little further to find deeper water for swimming. Kids can stay close to the shore and enjoy the shallow warm waters. 

In addition to being a great spot to visit, we love the drive to and from Presqu'ile Park. There really are few places like Prince Edward County. After a few hours on the beach we usually go for a drive and explore the countryside around the park. 

A perfect day-trip for us city-folk looking to forget the rat-race, even for a day.

Note: Bring everything you need - amenities are few and far between at the park. Basic washrooms/ change rooms are located by the beach parking. Stop in Brighton for your supplies on your way there.

The beach is also walking distance!!! It's fantastic.

Oh, and the visitor centre? Amazing! The kids absolutely love all the live animals they have -- typically from turtles to reptiles -- but the displays are also fantastic and well done.

The cons:
The beach is a little on the smaller side (depending on the tide) and you're kind of sitting in cottage country, where almost everything you're doing involves going between or around peoples' homes... so there's a disconnect from the camping experience.",1535114683

A lot of the roads through the campground are old, have pot holes and need to be filled or redone. Most bathrooms and showers are clean, the outhouses can be quite dirty though.

but I would recommend, the camp site are very private and the ones by the lake have a hiking trail going along the water.  Some parts of the trail lead to rocks that you can sit on and enjoy the coolness.",1499368336

If you arrive after hours (430 pm) they have unreserveable​ sites available and the tent ones are right on the lake!  I had#26 which I could see the red sunset beginning through the trees where my own private path went to the lake.  Large enough rocks to sit on.  I stayed 2 nights last week.  I literally heard no one talking the whole time on my site.  The beach is hardly used.  Nice trail called Rockcliffe. Takes you to top of granite outcropping that gives awesome view of whole lake.  A bald eagle flew over me!  Amazing!  Mosquitos quite bad as there is a lot of standing water but mostly when it's damp out. ,1500556847

It is a tourist attraction so in the warm weather it is packed with people. Parking is expensive but there are a few cheaper lots if you are willing to walk a few minutes.

Our Hardwoods area campsite was easy to access for setup, and provided just the wooded serenity we hoped for.  Public showers/washrooms seemed to be in high demand but both these and the garbage areas were kept reasonably clean. Our camper had  a serious challenge filling with water as the main hose was stripped and could not be properly attached to the rig to fill the tank. Dry camping it was indeed! Such a shame to see so many gallons run off on the gravel road. For a park this busy, the dump/fill area was poor. 

By contrast, the park's day use area was popular and the beach areas -- one for campers/day use and the other where pets were allowed -- were both very crowded with little room for getting into the water to cool down. Beach access is a car/bike ride away from the campsite area, although some did venture the long journey on foot. We would liked to have had the opportunity to visit the park's original homestead/museum. Ran out of time. 

Finally, for those interested in touring local attractions -- Sutton and surrounding area offers a great deal by way of local food, shopping, art, and history, with several park and boating options.",1534276488

We stayed on a water front site 204. It is an electrical site with water just out front and clean vault toilet very close by. A quick walk to the beach and a bike ride to the comfort station and visitors center. The site was quite sloped for our trailer so we had to put leveling blocks under the rear tires and the tongue jack all the way to the bottom to get it level. Gorgeous sunsets and a so many hikes available that we didn't have time to do them all. We did the Sea Lion and Joe Creek Trail. Both short trails Joe Creek had a cool creek you can walk in but not the beautiful view of Lake Superior we were hoping for. We also drove out to the Thunder Bay look out which is a long and rough ride in and a bit steep at times but a very beautiful view if you aren't terrified of heights. We wanted to do the top of the Giant trail (the knees) but it was a long bike then hike in. We were told it would take us about 11 hours return trip. Maybe next time.,1533264671

That will be refunded if you only stay for half an hour, but it takes most of that time to get in and out to the picnic area.",1533643633

It was really an excellent experience with beautiful landscapes and almost pure wilderness. There is clearly very little human traffic through the park (relative to its size); we estimate that 6 of the locations we set up camp hadn't seen visitors in over a year. The portage routes are often quite tough so bring an saw/machete. Really a special experience with our two young daughters (from 6-14 years of age).,1533960523

The park in general was very clean and quiet (probably because it was almost at the end of the season).

The campsite we used (#84) was very private and spacious, with a wooden staircase connecting to a small beach at the back. The campsite next door (#86) was even more private and spacious, but the entrance was too muddy for our car at the time.
In the evening, we could hear songs from the Pic Mobert First Nation across the lake. For us, it wasn’t bothering at all. We somewhat enjoyed hearing them. 
There were very loud train horns twice in the morning, but we didn’t really care since we were up and leaving early anyways.

I did not have much time to try fishing – only managed to cast few times from the shore and caught nothing. Nevertheless, I heard fishing is usually fantastic here. I briefly checked out the docks and fish cleaning stations, and they seemed pretty neat, too.

The shower facility was one of the cleanest I have ever seen in Provincial Parks.
The park staff member at the gatehouse was very friendly as well.",1540574016
